 A <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizen and a <LOCATION> Belize </LOCATION> citizen were being held after their small plane made an emergency landing on the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> coast, the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday. A ministry statement identified the American as <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Burton </PERSON>, 37, and the <LOCATION> Belize </LOCATION> citizen as <PERSON> Abimael </PERSON> <PERSON> Castillo </PERSON> <PERSON> Canur </PERSON>, 38. No hometowns were given. The men were taken into custody after their Aerocommander plane suffered a gas leak when it made an emergency landing Saturday at <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cabezas </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Zelaya </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Norte </LOCATION> province, 186 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION>. `` Given the irregularity and strangeness of the case, Nicaraguan authorities have decided to retain the crew members of the plane,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> statement said. The two will remain in custody `` until we clarify their identity, the ownership and nationality of the plan and the reasons they were traveling without any documents,'' the statement said. It said neither man nor the plane carried documents and that a flight plan had not been filed. A <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> source in <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION>, speaking on condition of anonymity, would only say that a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> consular official had visited <PERSON> Burton </PERSON>. The statement by the Nicaraguan government did not say where the men were being held. The <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Belize </LOCATION> governments had been notified of the case and asked for their cooperation in clearing up the affair.

<HEAD>Government Joins Suit Alleging Fraud by Pentagon Contractor</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The government has joined a `` whistleblower'' lawsuit that accuses <ORGANIZATION> Litton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of overcharging the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> $ 25 million for computer work, according to court documents unsealed Wednesday. The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> decision to intervene in the suit by a former <ORGANIZATION> Litton </ORGANIZATION> employee suggests government investigators believe the allegations may have merit. <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> McMenimen </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney's office in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, declined to comment on the action. The suit, filed last April by former <ORGANIZATION> Litton </ORGANIZATION> manager <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Carton </PERSON>, alleges that the company in effect charged the government for work it did for commercial customers using the same computer system. <ORGANIZATION> Litton </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Thom </PERSON> denied wrongdoing by the Beverly Hills-based company, which makes electronic navigation and control gear for a variety of military planes and missiles. The suit alleges the company programmed computers to under-record the amount of commercial work while properly recording the volume of government work at the <ORGANIZATION> Litton </ORGANIZATION> computer services division in the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> suburb of <LOCATION> Woodland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION>. Overcharges on dozens of computer design and engineering contracts from 1981 through 1987 amounted to at least $ 25 million, alleged Carton's attorney, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON>. The action was brought under the False Claims Act, which entitles those who report fraud against the government to get up to 25 percent of any damages awarded. <PERSON> Carton </PERSON> decided to file suit only after complaints to company officials and a <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> fraud hotline failed to bring action, <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON> said. `` He told everybody within the division ... and they did n't do anything,'' the lawyer said. `` He talked to somebody at the hotline in general terms but he was not persuaded or convinced that they were really going to make a serious effort to do something about this.'' <PERSON> Thom </PERSON> refused to comment in detail on the allegations, but maintained that joint government-civilian use of the computer system saved the Pentagon money. That is because civilian work could be scheduled during slack times in the government contracts and help defray operating cost of the system, he said. `` We're going to fight it,'' <PERSON> Thom </PERSON> said. `` We think the charges have no merit whatsoever.'' The lawsuit does n't specify which military systems might be involved in the alleged overcharges. It does n't name company officials responsible for the alleged overcharging, but <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON> said Carton believed knowledge went at least as high as top-division management. Carton, who was technical director at the division from 1984 to 1987, discovered the alleged cost-shifting while conducting a profitability study on the company's 30 commercial accounts, <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON> said. Commercial customers included businesses as diverse as <ORGANIZATION> Kaiser </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steel </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Flynt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Publications </ORGANIZATION>, publisher of hard-porn Hustler magazine. Carton, 46, left <ORGANIZATION> Litton </ORGANIZATION> on friendly terms during a reorganization of the division's management in early 1987 and now works for another defense contractor, <ORGANIZATION> Northrop </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, the attorney said. In addition to its electronics work, <ORGANIZATION> Litton </ORGANIZATION> builds <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> ships at its Ingalls shipyard in <LOCATION> Pascagoula </LOCATION>, Miss.

 Democrat <PERSON> Jill </PERSON> <PERSON> Long </PERSON> scored a surprise victory over Republican <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Heath </PERSON> Tuesday night in a special election for the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> seat that launched the political career of Vice President <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>. Long received 65,160 votes, or 51 percent, to 63,388, or 49 percent, for <PERSON> Heath </PERSON>. She will be the first Democrat to represent northeast <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>'s 4th Congressional District since <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> won the 1976 congressional election and the 26th woman in the 435-seat House of Representatives It was the third try for a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> political office by <PERSON> Long </PERSON>, who lost a bid for the seat last November by a margin of nearly 50,000 votes and lost the 1986 <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> election to <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>. `` I knew it was going to be a close race,'' <PERSON> Long </PERSON> said in her victory speech. `` I believed we were going to win. The surprise would have been if there had been a large margin of victory. `` I am committed to doing what I believe is right for northeast <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> and my country. I have long believed that <ORGANIZATION> Hoosiers </ORGANIZATION> are independent, and when we put forth god candidates on either side, we win,'' Long added. In his concession speech, <PERSON> Heath </PERSON> said, `` It's a hard pill to swallow but I am a man and a good man and I did my best.'' <PERSON> Heath </PERSON> claimed his record and credentials as a candidate had been distorted in the campaign by negative advertising. `` I apologize to no one and to no voter,'' he said. `` Winning this race was a quest but not an obsession.'' The polls closed at 6 p.m. EST, one hour after <PERSON> Heath </PERSON> and <PERSON> Long </PERSON> ended a final day of campaigning at restaurants and plant gates Thundershowers, which had been predicted for the afternoon and which Democrats had feared would reduce turnout among blue-collar voters casting ballots after factory shift changes, failed to materialize. With voting predicted to dip as low as 30 percent among more than 200,000 registered voters, turnout efforts were more important than usual, said party workers on both sides. <PERSON> Heath </PERSON> and Long renewed their campaigns before sunrise, each opening election day with a coffee shop stop here. An independent poll taken in the week before the election showed <PERSON> Heath </PERSON> with 44 percent and <PERSON> Long </PERSON> with 36 percent, with 20 percent still undecided. The 4th District seat was vacated in January by <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> incumbent <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Coats </PERSON>, who resigned to take the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> seat <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> occupied before becoming vice president. In 1976, district voters were the first to send <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> as a 28-year-old congressman. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> won re-election in 1978, then gave up the seat in a successful effort to defeat three-term <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> senator <PERSON> Birch </PERSON> <PERSON> Bayh </PERSON>. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> and First Lady <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaigned earlier for the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> candidate and former Democratic presidential hopeful Sen. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> campaigned for the Democrat. County election administrators decided to use paper ballots rather than voting machines or computer ballots to cut costs in an election that no one had budgeted. <LOCATION> Allen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> officials estimated paper ballots would save $ 20,000.

 Peace activists hauled trees onto a new rail spur used to transport <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> tanks, officials said, and police reportedly used truncheons to disperse protesters who had blocked a nearby road.

But activists, who asked not to be identified, said that at one point West German police used truncheons to break up a group of demonstrators blocking a road near the rail spur and that one protester was slightly injured. A police official, who also asked not to be identified, said late Tuesday that he had no information about the reported incident. <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON> said protesters placed small trees on the 5.2 mile rail link during the night but the debris was easily removed.

<HEAD>Savannah River Plant Managers Say They Recommend Putting Off Safety
Tests</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Managers of the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s nuclear weapons complex near here said Tuesday they have recommended putting off a series of safety tests until after one of its three idle reactors is restarted. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Westinghouse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savannah </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> River </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, which takes over as operator of the government-owned complex Saturday, said ultrasonic testing for cracks in the reactor vessel and piping would be `` just an added burden'' that would not enhance safety. `` The concept of doing the ultrasonic is really to get a good idea of the actual situation in the vessel to determine the long-term capabilities of the vessel,'' he said. `` It's not a near-term safety problem at all.'' Then-Energy Secretary <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Herrington </PERSON> said last year that he would require ultrasonic testing of the plant's K reactor before it could be restarted. All three active reactors at the plant have been shut down for safety reasons since last April. They are the nation's only source of tritium, a highly perishable gas needed to manufacture <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> nuclear weapons. The Pentagon has said that at least one of the reactors must be restarted by the end of this year to avert a serious shortage in tritium supplies. <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>, in an interview with The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> in his temporary office a few miles from the reactor complex, said <ORGANIZATION> Westinghouse </ORGANIZATION> remained committed to carrying out the ultrasonic testing. `` To put in an ultrasonic testing program ... would really be counterproductive in terms of all the other things going on,'' he said. Energy Department officials at the weapons plant are reviewing <ORGANIZATION> Westinghouse </ORGANIZATION>'s recommendation to put off the testing. The recommendation is part of a broad new plan that <ORGANIZATION> Westinghouse </ORGANIZATION> presented to the department last week as a proposed blueprint for restarting the K reactor, <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> declined to reveal other details of the restart strategy, which he said he would be discussing with Energy Secretary <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> over the next few weeks. <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> has instructed <ORGANIZATION> Westinghouse </ORGANIZATION> to give top priority to getting the K reactor running again, but has stressed that operations would not resume until safety could be assured. He has not commented directly on the question of whether ultrasonic testing is needed first. The company that has managed the <ORGANIZATION> Savannah </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> River </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Plant </ORGANIZATION> since its construction in the 1950s, E.I. du <ORGANIZATION> Pont </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> de </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nemours </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, has used conventional tests with colored dyes to search for cracking in reactor vessels and piping, and had said earlier this year that it planned to start ultrasonic testing this summer. A leak from a crack in the vessel of another reactor at <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, the the C reactor, was discovered in 1984. That led to its permanent shutdown a year later.

 Striking government workers used slingshots to hurl fishing weights at police and were repelled with tear-gas grenades in the latest battle over union demands for a cost-of-living bonus. French Premier <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Rocard </PERSON> offered to reopen negotiations in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> on a bonus to cover high costs on the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> island, but several unions said the talks should take place in <LOCATION> Corsica </LOCATION>. The 400 to 500 demonstrators, some of them masked, hurled stones and fishing weights Tuesday at the prefecture building in the northern port of <LOCATION> Bastia </LOCATION>. They were charged by riot squads but regrouped and attacked throughout the day, witnesses said. The workers are demanding a bonus to offset the high cost of living on <LOCATION> Corsica </LOCATION>, estimated at 4.2 percent more expensive than the French mainland. At least one demonstrator and three policemen were injured in the clashes, Corsican officials said. Union leaders met with government officials on Saturday, but talks broke down after just two hours. <PERSON> Rocard </PERSON> designated the Cabinet minister in charge of the civil service, <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> Tuesday's violence was the latest in six weeks of intermittant strikes and blockades or ports and airports which cut the <LOCATION> Mediteranean </LOCATION> island off from the mainland.

<HEAD>Politicians Get 520 Pages of Speech Fodder in New Book of Quotes</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT M. ANDREWS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Politicians stumped for memorable quotations to enliven their speeches need look no further than `` Respectfully Quoted,'' a newly published book from the <ORGANIZATION> Library </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> that is crammed with 2,100 oratorical gems from the past. The book might give some comfort to Sen. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Biden </PERSON>, D-Del., whose 1988 presidential hopes were torpedoed partly by a controversy over cribbed comments If <PERSON> Biden </PERSON> recalls a famous line from President <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>'s inaugural address in 1961, he might be intrigued that Lebanese writer <PERSON> Kahlil </PERSON> <PERSON> Gibran </PERSON> asked much earlier, `` Are you a politician asking what your country can do for you, or a zealous one asking what you can do for your country? The book, a three-year project by <PERSON> Suzy </PERSON> <PERSON> Platt </PERSON> of the library's congressional reference division, is a compilation of quotations which members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> or their staffs over the past 75 years have asked the library to verify for their exact wording and origins For the hapless politician scrambling to extricate himself from trouble, there's this reputed quote from former Republican presidential candidate <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Romney </PERSON>: `` I did n't say that I did n't say it I said that I did n't say that I said it. I want to make that very clear.'' It was <PERSON> Theodore </PERSON> <PERSON> Roosevelt </PERSON> who cast this verbal harpoon at President <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tyler </PERSON>: `` He has been called a mediocre man, but this is unwarranted flattery. He was a politician of monumental littleness.'' Exasperation prompted former Rep. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Danielson </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Calif </LOCATION>., to declare that trying to get answers from Attorney General <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> during <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> hearings on the Watergate scandal in 1974 was `` like trying to nail a drop of water to the wall. `` These quotations come from the real world of cut-and-thrust politics,'' says <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Goodrum </PERSON>, former assistant director of the library's <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, which compiled the 520-page dictionary of political quotes. `` They show the combination of spirit and humor that represents <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> political activity at its best.'' Ms. <PERSON> Platt </PERSON> amassed verified quotations which researchers began recording on 3-by-5 cards nearly 50 years ago to avoid time-consuming duplication of efforts. The CRS handles more than 1,500 requests for information from <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> every day. The researchers discovered that some widely used quotes, now part of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> folklore, are impossible to trace to the person who first uttered them. Other quotes have been mistakenly attributed to a few legendary orators, such as <PERSON> Abraham </PERSON> <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON>. It has never been verified, they say, that <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> _ or P.T. <PERSON> Barnum </PERSON> _ observed that `` you may fool all the people some of the time; you can even fool some of the people all the time, but you ca n't fool all of the people all the time.'' Who said, `` Winning is n't everything, it's the only thing?'' The library says it was n't the late <PERSON> Vince </PERSON> <PERSON> Lombardi </PERSON> but <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sanders </ORGANIZATION>, football coach at <ORGANIZATION> Vanderbilt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Goodrum </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> no longer produces thundering, long-winded orators of the likes of <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Webster </PERSON>, <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Clay </PERSON> or <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Calhoun </PERSON>, and that television's insatiable hunger for 20-second `` sound bites'' is largely to blame. `` Today's politicians probably are n't as quotable as the old-time orators who spoke in the measured cadences of the Bible and <PERSON> Shakespeare </PERSON>,'' he said. `` Even though their quotes do n't stand up so they can be chiseled on marble as clearly, their speeches reflect some very incisive thinking about the major issues of our time.''

Assistant Federal Public Defender <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Flanagan </PERSON> immediately obtained the stay from <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Pro </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION>. Pro told <PERSON> Pellegrini </PERSON> he should return to the state courts and file any post-conviction appeals possible at that level before filing any more federal court petitions. <PERSON> Pellegrini </PERSON> was sentenced to die for the slaying of <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Hancock </PERSON>, 27, who was handcuffed and shot in the head. <PERSON> Flanagan </PERSON> sought a stay on grounds a prosecutor improperly suggested during a penalty hearing that there could be more victims if <PERSON> Pellegrini </PERSON> ever got out of prison. The defender also claimed authorities conducted an illegal search of <PERSON> Pellegrini </PERSON>'s apartment, where the murder weapon, bullets and blood-spattered clothes were found. The same issues were raised in a state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> appeal, which was rejected last November when the high court held that the record provided substantial support for the verdict and the penalty.

 Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> rejects speculation that U.S.-Cuban relations are about to improve, saying American policy will not change until <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> ends repression at home and `` unacceptable behavior'' abroad. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>'s views are outlined in a confidential memo drawn up to counter suggestions that <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>'s pledge in December to withdraw its troops from <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> will improve the climate between <LOCATION> Havana </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. `` <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy has not changed in the wake of the southern <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> accords,'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said in the memo. The memo has been distributed to diplomatic posts abroad and to selected government agencies. The document is dated March 1989 and is stamped `` confidential.'' A copy was made available to The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday. The memo indicates that no changes are planned from the hard-line <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> policy of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration. Under President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> tightened the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade embargo against the island and waged an international campaign against alleged human rights abuses by the regime of <PERSON> Fidel </PERSON> <PERSON> Castro </PERSON>. `` No modification of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy is contemplated in the absence of significant changes in Cuban repression at home and unacceptable behavior abroad inimical to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> interests,'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> rejected the arguments of some, including <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Claiborne </PERSON> <PERSON> Pell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-R.I. </LOCATION>, that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy toward <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> over three decades has failed and should be changed. `` <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> provides the U.S.S.R. major political, strategic and intelligence benefits that it otherwise would not have,'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said. `` <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> continues to engage in military adventurism abroad and to support subversive movements in the <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hemisphere </LOCATION> to the detriment of peace, stability and democratic processes. `` Further, the <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> government persists in its internal repression and violation of the basic human rights of its citizens. <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> has not changed its basic policies.'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> is involved in a public diplomatic effort to reinforce the impression that there will be an improvement in relations with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. He said an end to the trade embargo, imposed by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in 1960, `` would benefit greatly the failed Cuban economy and enhance <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>'s image and prestige.'' It also would undercut <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> efforts to encourage other countries to maintain economic and political distance from <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>, he said. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> `` has steadfastly failed to offer any concrete proposals of its own to satisfy longstanding and well-known <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. concerns.'' As described by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials, <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> has demonstrated a more accommodating attitude toward the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> over the last 18 months, and there has been an improvement in the ability of the two countries to work out differences on non-strategic issues, such as immigration. Cuban officials have disclosed that the head of the Cuban Interests Section in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Ramon </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanchez </PERSON> <PERSON> Parodi </PERSON>, will be replaced shortly by <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Arbesu </PERSON>, a vice chief of <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, a party organism that oversees <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>'s relations with other nations in the <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hemisphere </LOCATION> Former Assistant Secretary of State <PERSON> Elliott </PERSON> <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> said Monday that the Cuban shift indicates a willingness to intensify discussions with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> on issues that have divided the two countries. He noted that <PERSON> Arbesu </PERSON> had been instrumental in the negotiations leading to the agreement on <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>. But two current <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials, both insisting on anonymity, said they did not see <PERSON> Arbesu </PERSON>'s appointment as a political signal. <PERSON> Sanchez </PERSON> <PERSON> Parodi </PERSON> has been in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> since September 1977 and is one of the longest serving heads of diplomatic missions in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> continues to support `` radical political movements and violent subversive groups'' in <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. `` <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> provides a wide range of support for the <ORGANIZATION> FMLN </ORGANIZATION> insurgent armies in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> and guerrilla groups in <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION>,'' the secretary said. `` <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> has close relations with and provides extensive military and economic assistance to the Sandinista regime in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> which, in turn, provides material support to guerrillas throughout <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> added that <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> has exploited <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> differences with <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s government by using the dispute to promote Latin American solidarity against the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said, <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> has been supporting subversion in <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> and to a lesser extent rebel groups in <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ecuador </LOCATION>.

 The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> says <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> refusal to stop arming rebels in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> could lead to a wider conflict in <LOCATION> Southwest </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>. Two Soviet diplomats, at a news conference Tuesday, urged Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> to reconsider a <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> proposal for a mutual arms embargo. `` So far, the American side is reluctant to accept our proposal,'' <PERSON> Oleg </PERSON> <PERSON> Derkovsky </PERSON>, a counselor at the Soviet embassy here, said. He said Soviet Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> is likely to renew the appeal when <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> goes to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> in May. <PERSON> Derkovsky </PERSON> said fighting between the rebels and the Afghan government is escalating and could involve <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, as the two countries seek to protect their interests. The Soviet diplomat said the two countries were concerned that <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> might try to arrange a federation with <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> should the rebels succeed in overthrowing President <PERSON> Najibullah </PERSON>'s government `` People have to be very careful of avoiding incidents that could lead to a larger conflict,'' <PERSON> Yevgeny </PERSON> <PERSON> Kutovoy </PERSON>, minister-counselor of the embassy, said. The two diplomats accused the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> of illegally arming the rebels and said the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> should conduct an inquiry and consider posting monitors at the country's borders The diplomats also recalled predictions that <PERSON> Najibullah </PERSON> would collapse `` like a house of cards'' after the Feb. 15 departure of Soviet troops. The Soviet-backed Afghan leader and his army `` have shown most convincingly they are prepared to uphold on their own the country's sovereignty,'' <PERSON> Kutovoy </PERSON> said Soviet troops backed the government in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> against the U.S.-armed rebels for nine years. The war has continued since their departure. Kutovoy accused <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> of training and arming rebel forces in `` extensive subversive and terrorist activities'' to overthrow <PERSON> Najibullah </PERSON>'s government. He said Pakistani officers were directing attacks and that Pakistani servicemen have been captured deep inside <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>'s involvement calls for a special investigation by the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> monitoring of the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> accords of last April which barred outside intervention in the Afghan war, <PERSON> Kutovoy </PERSON> said. At the same time, <PERSON> Kutovoy </PERSON> and <PERSON> Derkovsky </PERSON> criticized the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration for its decision to maintain <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> arms shipments to the rebels through <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military aid `` is contradictory to the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> accords, and does not help the peaceful solution of the situation in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Kutovoy </PERSON> said. `` The continuation of the shipments to the parties in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> is a source of the continuation of the fratricidal conflict in that country.'' <PERSON> Derkovsky </PERSON>, meanwhile, said the Soviets are no longer arming <PERSON> Najibullah </PERSON>'s government and that the weapons left behind with the departure of Soviet troops are not outlawed by the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> accords. But, he said, `` any supply of weapons to the opposition forces in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> through the territory of <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> is a clear-cut, flagrant violation'' of the accords. `` Any weapon coming to <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> through <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> is a violation,'' <PERSON> Derkovsky </PERSON> said. `` If it comes from heaven, it's OK. If it comes through the territory of <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, no way, it's a violation.'' <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman, said she had no comment on the Soviet allegations or on whether the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> should conduct an inquiry.

<DATELINE>PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Ignoring a new moderation in neighboring <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, this country's Communist government has silenced or muted voices critical of its rule. To a flurry of publicity in the West and protest even from the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc, playwright <PERSON> Vaclav </PERSON> <PERSON> Havel </PERSON> was arrested Jan. 16 and subsequently sentenced to eight months in jail. At least seven leading activists who are less known abroad but important in the emerging, younger dissident groups at home have also been jailed. Dozens of other critical voices have been muted by what dissidents term not only the most sweeping crackdown in a decade but a skillful, carefully targeted repression. Last year, it appeared to other activists that the authorities had at last loosened up on Charter 77, <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s oldest human rights movement, and were prepared to tolerate a measure of more active dissent. Leading activists such as <PERSON> Havel </PERSON> and fellow Chartist <PERSON> Jiri </PERSON> <PERSON> Dienstbier </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jiri </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruml </PERSON> began publishing Lidove Noviny -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> -RRB-, an underground monthly they estimated quickly gained a readership of 4,000 and even seemed a candidate for legal registration A year later, those hopes are dashed. Underground journals, starved of equipment and money, can not reach more than a few thousand readers, making activists dependent on foreign radio stations _ widely listened to in <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> _ to spread their news. `` Our great problem is the problem of information,'' said Charter 77 signatory <PERSON> Ladislav </PERSON> <PERSON> Lis </PERSON>. The situation has worsened, he noted, with the passage of new laws this month imposing stiff fines or jail terms on anyone circulating any documents deemed anti-Communist. Dissidents see various factors behind the change of tactics by the authorities. One is that the <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> conference reviewing implementation of the 1975 <LOCATION> Helsinki </LOCATION> Final Act has ended. At that forum, <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> found itself under fire for repression of known dissidents. Now, the authorities assure Western diplomats they will implement the <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> accords _ they appear willing, for instance, to make it easier for millions of citizens to travel to the West _ but are not giving rein to groups they view as anti-Communist enemies. Probably the biggest factor in the changed tactics is the response to mass anti-government protests that occurred in August, October and January. <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION>, a charming city of winding alleys, towers and steeples, is the only capital in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> where riot police appeared on the streets six times in five months, using tear gas, batons, dogs, water cannon and even armored personnel carriers to disperse peaceful crowds. Thousands of intellectuals signed at least three different petitions to the government protesting the police actions and the detention of <PERSON> Havel </PERSON> and other dissidents. The crackdown on known dissenters since has signaled the authorities' determination not to allow Charter 77 a voice in politics. Instead, an official committee was created in December to monitor human rights. Two officials, <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> Flegel </PERSON> and <PERSON> Zbynek </PERSON> <PERSON> Vokrouhlicky </PERSON>, said in an interview they have already solved 65 cases where citizens previously were refused permission to travel abroad. But the committee has not spoken out against the police brutality in January and against toughened penalties on violating public order, an indication of authorities' desire to maintain control over political and social activity. Yet change could be in the offing. There have been few if any reprisals against the intellectuals who signed the petitions, an indication that at least some of the country's Communist leaders realize they can not isolate the brains they need to revitalize an increasingly stagnant economy. A well-informed source who asked not to be identified reported that at a meeting in mid-March, senior party leaders and economists discussed a plan to open the economy and allow some political liberalization. The plan _ the work of economist <PERSON> Valtr </PERSON> <PERSON> Komarek </PERSON>, who drew attention late last year with highly critical analyses of the Czechoslovak economy _ was rejected when first put to party leaders last December. Now, the source reported, it appears to have at least partial support from party leader <PERSON> Milos </PERSON> <PERSON> Jakes </PERSON>, who Western diplomats believe is under some pressure from the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> to open up to reform.

<TEXT>
 Voters on Tuesday rejected a proposal to increase the sales tax half a penny to finance an $ 8.4 billion expansion of the growth-burdened <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION> area's mass transit system. With ballots from 923 of 1,093 precincts counted, the tax increase had 114,618 votes, or 38.5 percent, to 182,833 votes, or 61.5 percent, against. `` Obviously this train is not leaving the station,'' said Mayor <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Goddard </PERSON>. The 30-year tax increase would have paid for a system which had been hailed by some as the metropolitan area's salvation from traffic jams and hazy skies and condemned by others as a white elephant. County Recorder <PERSON> Helen </PERSON> <PERSON> Purcell </PERSON> had predicted a 30 percent turnout, or around 265,000 registered voters, for the vote on Proposition 300, the seed ballot for the ValTrans system. Approval would have raised the sales tax in most of the county to 7 percent by July 1. Proposition 300 asked voters to fund a 103-mile elevated railway, 23 miles of rush-hour train service along regular tracks, freeway lanes for multiple-passenger vehicles and a bus system expanded from 350 buses to 1,500. The <ORGANIZATION> Regional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION> had projected a $ 44-per-year cost to the average household. But a study by the <ORGANIZATION> Arizona </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tax </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associations </ORGANIZATION> put the cost at $ 82 to $ 107. <ORGANIZATION> ValTrans </ORGANIZATION> was pushed as a way to reduce both air pollution and the nation's second-highest rates for auto insurance, to unclog city streets and to help families get rid of second or third cars. Opponents said <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION> was too spread out for mass transit. ValTrans was the second version of Proposition 300 put before voters in 3 -LCB- years. The first, approved by more than two-thirds of the voters in October 1985, created the <ORGANIZATION> RPTA </ORGANIZATION> to plan for growth. It also instituted a 20-year, half-cent sales tax for 231 miles of freeways. So far, three miles have been completed and 22 miles are under construction. <ORGANIZATION> RPTA </ORGANIZATION> planners said ValTrans' first impact would have been more buses and routes beginning in September. The 10-year, rush-hour train service between <LOCATION> Chandler </LOCATION> and downtown <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION> would have begun in 1991. The initial 24 miles of the light-rail system between <LOCATION> Glendale </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Tempe </LOCATION> would have opened in 1995.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has made a few changes to the White House grounds, but the woodshed out back remains. You wo n't find it by the new horseshoe pit <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had installed, or the `` Beware of Dog'' sign he posted by the Rose Garden. The woodshed is invisible, fabricated by onetime budget director <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Stockman </PERSON> during a contrite 1981 news conference. Just as <PERSON> Stockman </PERSON> claimed he was `` taken to the woodshed'' by President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> for his public criticism of the president's economic policies, so was <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> counsel <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Boyden </PERSON> <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> rebuked for publicly raising questions about a day-old bipartisan agreement on <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> endorsed by the president In both cases, the dressing-down may have been more for show than for real, and parallels can be drawn between the two incidents. <PERSON> Gray </PERSON>, in an interview with <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>, suggested the new agreement with <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> diluted the constitutional powers of the president. The statement questioning a presidential decision was highly unusual coming from a White House subordinate, and the reverberations were almost immediate. White House press secretary <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> _ asked at his daily news briefing if <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> had yet been to the woodshed over his remarks _ said the official, in fact, had just met privately on that very matter with both <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and chief of staff <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON>. `` They had a polite discussion about how things work in the White House,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. And <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, asked for his reaction to <PERSON> Gray </PERSON>'s criticism, said pointedly: `` I shared my reaction with <PERSON> Boyden </PERSON>, which is the way I handle things.'' <PERSON> Stockman </PERSON> found himself in hot water when his skepticism about the ability of Reaganomics to make a dent in the budget deficit found its way into an article in the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> Monthly. And one of the first people <PERSON> Stockman </PERSON> sought out for advice was <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, according to no less a source than <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> himself. In his 1987 biography, `` Looking Forward,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` A forlorn figure in a dark blue suit showed up at my office seeking advice.'' It was <PERSON> Stockman </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said the youthful budget director told him that he believed his comments to writer <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Greider </PERSON> had been off the record, which <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said seemed a little naive because <PERSON> Stockman </PERSON> also told him <PERSON> Greider </PERSON> had a tape recorder going. `` When <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> finished telling his story, my advice was that he go down to the Oval Office as soon as possible, get an appointment with the president, and give him the same account he'd just given me. ` Admit you've made a mistake and apologize,' I advised him. `` My thought was that everyone's entitled to one mistake,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> wrote. <PERSON> Stockman </PERSON>, in his 1986 book, `` The Triumph of Politics,'' claims he was n't scolded by <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> in the Oval Office meeting that followed. In fact, he wrote, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> asked him to stay on, saying `` I need your help.'' <PERSON> Stockman </PERSON>, who resigned his <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> job four years later, saw his book become a best seller and went on to become a Wall Street financial consultant, said he created the `` woodshed story'' to appease other White House aides. <PERSON> Stockman </PERSON> said the line about him having been called on the carpet by <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was demanded by an enraged chief of staff, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, who told him it was the only way he could save his job. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, now the secretary of state, also figures prominently in the recent episode. <PERSON> Gray </PERSON>'s voicing of concerns about the constitutionality of the Central American agreement marked the second time the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> counsel had challenged <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, who was the chief architect of the accord. Earlier, <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> raised conflict-of-interest questions about stocks <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> held in a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> bank because it was a Third World creditor. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> sold his holdings as a result. Any conversation between <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> at the woodshed remains unreported. Meanwhile, White House officials are taking the flap in stride, even with a measure of humor. `` First of all, I want to announce that <PERSON> Boyden </PERSON> <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> concurs in the constitutionality of the Easter Egg Roll,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said at the outset of his briefing on woodshed day. `` I checked with him myself.''

<HEAD>Accident Blamed on Drunken Driver Leads to Strong Recommendations</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BRISCOE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Federal safety officials are calling for tougher drunken driving laws and want the oldest one-fifth of the nation's school buses off the road, in response to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>' worst alcohol-related highway accident. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, ending its inquiry into the May 1988 head-on collision that killed 24 children and three adults aboard a <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> church bus, adopted a long list of recommendations for federal and state officials Tuesday. Flames spread through the bus after it collided with a pickup truck that was going the wrong way on Interstate 71 near <LOCATION> Carrollton </LOCATION>, Ky. Authorities said the pickup driver had a blood alcohol content of .26 in tests 90 minutes after the accident, and a board investigator said Tuesday he likely was at .29 when the collision occurred, which is nearly three times the legal level of presumed intoxication. All 27 deaths aboard the bus, which belonged to the <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> God </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Radcliff </LOCATION>, were attributed to smoke inhalation, the board said. Forty people escaped, most with injuries. The bus was returning from an amusement park near <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION>'s acting chairman, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kolstad </PERSON>, said the May 14 collision `` may be one of the most influential highway accidents the board has ever heard.'' The board said the accident clearly was caused by `` the alcohol-impaired condition'' of the pickup truck driver, <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahoney </PERSON>, 35, of <LOCATION> Worthville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>, who is free on $ 540,000 bail awaiting a November trial on 27 counts of murder. But the board also said characteristics of the 11-year-old former school bus contributed to the accident's severity. The vehicle's unprotected fuel tank, flammable seat covers and a rear door partially obstructed by the last row of seats were all noted in the report which was adopted after a daylong session. The <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> bus was assembled by <ORGANIZATION> Sheller-Globe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Toledo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>. Last July, both <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Sheller-Globe </ORGANIZATION> reached out-of-court settlements for undisclosed amounts with families of nearly all the victims' families. Neither company admitted any liability. The board recommended that states set a date for phase-out of buses not meeting 1977 federal standards. If adopted nationwide, the rule would affect 77,000 school buses, about 22 percent of those now in use. It would also affect thousands of former school buses used by church groups and other organizations. The 1977 standards required strengthened fuel systems, stronger seats, toughened roof and body joints and more accessible exits. The five-member board also asked states to toughen their drunken-driving laws to allow police to revoke drivers' licenses, to prohibit plea-bargaining in drunken-driving cases and to end the practice of giving convicted drunken drivers reduced licensing penalties if they enroll in treatment programs. Among safety improvements suggested by the <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION>, which has no enforcement powers and can only recommend actions to other federal agencies and the states, were making seatcovers out of fire retardant material, putting more exits on school buses and making their fuel tanks more resistant to puncture in severe accidents. The board noted that a three-inch tear in the fuel tank on the <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> bus led to the fire that engulfed the vehicle. But the board said it was unclear whether such strengthening measures would have prevented the fuel tank rupture, which it said was probably caused by a spring broken loose in the collision. It also noted that flame-retardant requirements did not change under the 1977 rules. The bus involved in the crash was built two weeks before the stiffened federal school bus safety requirements took effect April 1, 1977. Among specific board recommendations were: _ That the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Highway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Traffic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> require more fire-retardant material in bus seatcovers _ That school buses be made to meet the same standards for exit doors imposed on public transit buses, including the installation of either more exits or pop-out windows _ That the safety administration evaluate and revise, if necessary, its standards on the placement of school bus fuel tanks, plus adding various protective structures around the tanks, in addition to cages required under the 1977 law _ That the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Highway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> conduct a test of increasing the number of `` wrong way'' signs on divided highways to determine the signs' effectiveness in reducing wrong-way accidents, which the board said kill an average of more than 270 people a year _ That church groups and other private organizations purchase only buses that meet the post-1977 standards <PERSON> Micky </PERSON> <PERSON> Sadoff </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Mothers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Against </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drunk </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Driving </ORGANIZATION>, praised the recommendations but said she was saddened that the board focused more on bus safety than drunken driving. `` We would n't want to put down bus safety in any way,'' she said, but added, `` The equivalent of a fully loaded 747 crashing every week for a year equals the number of fatalities on our roads due to drunk driving.'' The board said 51 percent of the 46,000 annual fatalities are attributable to alcohol use.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> says proposals to legalize narcotics are `` 180 degrees wrong'' and the entertainment industry should stop depicting drugs as a humorous or harmless diversion. `` We have to change the way this problem has been looked at,'' the president said Tuesday during a question-and-answer session with about 100 civic class students at a high school in a <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> suburb of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. Inching further away from his once ironclad opposition to tighter gun controls, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also said `` maybe there's a need for more laws'' to restrict the semiautomatic assault-style weapons that are used in drug-related violence. And he backed away from his earlier support of the proposal for a 51 percent pay increase for members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> _ an idea that died under a tidal wave of public opposition. `` In retrospect,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` it was too big a bite at once and the country did n't support it at all. So to accommodate the needs, the legitimate needs for a raise, it has to be done differently.'' Fielding a question on foreign policy, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is `` the only country that can be a substantial catalyst for peace' in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will hold separats at the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> next week with Egyptian President <PERSON> Hosni </PERSON> <PERSON> Mu </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> Foreign Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>. `` We will be probing as best we can and making suggestions to them as to what the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> can do in trying to bring about peace in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. The president talked with students during a surprise visit to <ORGANIZATION> James </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Madison </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in the <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> suburb of <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>, about 15 miles from the White House. The school had only 90 minutes' warning he was coming To the delight of hundreds of chatting teen-agers in the school cafeteria, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had lunch with them, eating pizza and french fries and sipping milk through a straw. In the school library, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> perched on a stool and answered questions for 30 minutes. Bemoaning `` this stupid abuse of drugs,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said that `` for a while in this country, it seemed to be we condoned those things we should condemn.'' `` And we went through a period where the treatment, for example, of the use of cocaine in movies was done in a humorous vein or some kind of, well, harmless, but made the user look like some kind of silly idiot,'' he said. `` But nothing ... condemnatory. `` And so, we've got to mobilize the entertainment media and say, look, do n't put out great emotion in favor of or treat these _ in favor of cocaine or other drugs.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he recognizes that students are under pressure from their peers to experiment with drugs. He suggested that schools try to educate students `` about the damage that comes from substance abuse.'' He said that `` people used to talk about legalizing narcotics.'' Without naming names, he said, `` And that was some very serious people. And I just think it's 180 degrees wrong.'' Answering a question about international terrorism, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` It's like dealing with fog _ you ca n't get hold of it very well.'' In another development, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he was still seeking clarifications from <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> on building the advanced FSX jet fighter and that efforts to nail down an agreement were `` going back and forth a little.'' Administration officials said the final go-ahead on the joint project was being delayed by haggling with <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> over who will own the technology and how many planes would be U.S.-built. It is possible that a Japanese-set Friday deadline for a final decision may be missed, said the officials, speaking on condition of anonymity. However, officials also sought to dispel the idea that the project was unraveling and said a deal was still considered likely.

 <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> says his thoughts were on securing his first state budget when he began the day March 28, 1979, but instead he wound up dealing with the nation's worst commercial nuclear accident. Now <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney General, <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> had been <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> governor 72 days when a stuck valve at the <LOCATION> Three </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mile </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> plant allowed vital cooling water to drain from the Unit 2 reactor's radioactive core Although the plant was just 10 miles from the Capitol in <LOCATION> Harrisburg </LOCATION>, it could have been on the other side of the planet as far as <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON>'s understanding of nuclear energy was concerned. Nuclear jargon `` was like a foreign language to me,'' he said Tuesday in a speech at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>. Still, <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> was a quick study, and is widely credited for his calm handling of the accident. In Tuesday's speech, as in a speech he gave four years ago at <ORGANIZATION> Duke </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> said he learned that a manager `` should not be afraid to scramble the organization chart, as we did during Three Mile Island.'' He compared his handling of the accident to President <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> during the Cuban missile crisis, `` when his own brother's advice weighed more heavily with him than that of the secretary of State or the Joint Chiefs of Staff.'' No one was hurt during the accident, although radioactive gas was released into the atmosphere and pregnant women and preschoolers were advised by <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> to evacuate within five miles of the plant. <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> said he learned another lesson at TMI: `` respect but do not depend on the news media.'' While much of the reporting of the accident was reliable, he said some was `` downright outrageous.'' <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> added a postscript to Tuesday's speech, saying the 1986 accident at <LOCATION> Chernobyl </LOCATION> that killed at least 31 people `` might have been prevented if the people of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> were as free to question their authorities'' as were Americans in 1979. After <ORGANIZATION> TMI </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> served a second term as governor beginning in 1982, then headed the <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Politics </ORGANIZATION> at <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Kennedy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Government </ORGANIZATION> before becoming attorney general last August. On other matters Tuesday, <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON>: _ Said the question of whether special investigations should be required for members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> suspected of criminal wrongdoing would be resolved `` at an early date. An order signed by <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON>'s predecessor, <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, called for attorneys general to appoint an independent counsel to investigate serious allegations against congressmen and senators. `` I'm no great fan of independent counsels, period,'' <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> said, adding that a review of <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s order was nearing completion. _ Said he was unaware of a contingency plan for any federal takeover of the police department in the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>, which has been plagued by drug-related murders _ Sidestepped a question on the appropriateness of a suit against random drug testing filed by Executive Office employees While declining to give an `` offhand'' opinion of the suit, <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> said he was encouraged by recent <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> rulings upholding <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Customs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> drug testing and post-accident drug testing by railroads. `` The validation of drug testing by the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> does send in my view a very positive signal _ gives a green light _ to those in the private sector who want to use sound drug testing programs to ensure a drug-free workplace,'' he said.

<HEAD>With USS Stark Death Claims Settled, Claims for Injured Begin</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RUTH SINAI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The Pentagon is preparing claims on behalf of the 21 sailors injured in a missile attack on the USS Stark now that <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> has agreed to compensate the families of the 37 killed in the 1987 incident. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> also intends to ask <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> for compensation to cover the $ 82.9 million repair bill for the guided missile frigate, which was badly damaged when two French-made Exocet missiles were fired at the ship as it steamed through the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>. `` We intend to move quickly to file those claims'' now that <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> has agreed to pay $ 27.3 million for the dead, a <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official said Tuesday after the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> announced the settlement with <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. Among the 60 claims still to be filed against <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> are several on behalf of two seamen seriously injured in the fiery attack, and others on behalf of servicemen who suffered light burns and other injuries, officials said. The officials said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> wanted to see the outcome of the claim for the dead before submitting those for the survivors. `` The government of <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> has undertaken to make prompt payment of the full amount,'' said a defense official. `` Payments will be made to the families as quickly as possible after the receipt of the funds.'' <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s agreement to settle the claim was viewed by the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> as a `` good sign,'' said one diplomat. `` Further lack of progress in the case could have affected relations,'' he added, speaking on condition of anonymity. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> renewed its ties with <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> in 1984 after a 17-year break and has sought to maintain a steady improvement despite some tensions. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> apologized for the missile attack, which occurred at the height of the <LOCATION> Iran-Iraq </LOCATION> `` tanker war,'' saying the pilot mistook the Stark for an enemy Iranian vessel. After an investigation, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> accepted the explanation. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> claim was presented 11 months ago but it took a trip to <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION> last week by one of the department's top trouble shooters, legal adviser <PERSON> Abraham </PERSON> <PERSON> Sofaer </PERSON>, to nudge the Iraqis into action. Officials said the American team was called in to see <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> Foreign Minister <PERSON> Tariq </PERSON> <PERSON> Aziz </PERSON> on Monday `` and told that this was what -LRB- <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> -RRB- President -LRB- <PERSON> Saddam </PERSON> -RRB- <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> had decided.'' `` There were no negotiations,'' one source continued. `` They just announced this was what they were prepared to pay.'' The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> team decided it was better to settle for slightly less than the original claim of $ 29.6 million in order to prevent further delays, the officials said. Each family will get an average of $ 740,000 according to a formula that takes into account the servicemen's remaining dependents. After the attack, the Stark spent several months undergoing temporary repairs in <LOCATION> Bahrain </LOCATION> before returning with its surviving crew members to their home base in <LOCATION> Mayport </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, near <LOCATION> Jacksonville </LOCATION>, in August 1987. The Stark later sailed to the shipyard in <LOCATION> Pascagoula </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Miss. </LOCATION>, where it was built, for extensive repairs. It returned to fleet duty in <LOCATION> Mayport </LOCATION> in September 1988. Settlement of the Stark compensation brought to mind the unsettled claims of 290 victims of another <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> attack _ those killed when the <ORGANIZATION> USS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Vincennes </ORGANIZATION> mistakenly shot down an Iranian airliner over the gulf last year. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> says it has not gotten specifics about those killed and therefore has been unable to determine the compensation. `` We've tried a number of channels to obtain information,'' but nothing has been accomplished over the past several months, said a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official, speaking on condition of anonymity.

<HEAD>Regional Expenses of Raising Soybeans Vary Within Both US, Brazil</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A study by the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> says that <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> both have some cost advantages in the production of soybeans, but that the expenses vary greatly from region to region in each country. <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> is the chief competitor of American farmers in the lucrative world soybean market and is expected to harvest a record crop this year. <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> also has been expanding production. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has a big lead in global soybean output, producing 41.9 million metric tons of the world's 93.4 million tons forecast for the 1988-89 harvest. <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>'s harvest is currently indicated at 21 million tons, and <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>'s 8.5 million. A metric ton is about 2,205 pounds and is equal to 36.7 bushels of soybeans. Questions have been raised about costs of production and whether <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> farmers can continue to compete with the growing output in the <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hemisphere </LOCATION> countries, particularly <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>. The study by the department's <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> offered no final answer to the debate but did pinpoint a number of regional cost differences in each country. For example, the study showed that American farmers generally have an edge with lower `` variable'' costs of production, which includes expenses for fertilizer, weedkillers, seeds and labor. But `` fixed'' costs are higher than in <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>. Those include general farm overhead, taxes, insurance and interest payments. In the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, using 1986 figures, the soybean regions with the lowest variable costs are the <ORGANIZATION> Corn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Belt </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plains </LOCATION> regions, with production costs averaging in a range $ 50 to $ 60 per ton. Those areas account for about 70 percent of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> soybean area. But when the Southeast and <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> regions are included, the average variable cost jumps sharply to $ 110 per ton. `` Given the substantial portion of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> soybean area outside the <LOCATION> Corn </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Belt-Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> region, use of data from this region alone may be inappropriate for making comparisons with <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>,'' the report said. Looking at <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>, the analysts noted that the traditional soybean area is in the south, including the states of <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Grande </LOCATION> do Sul, <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Catarina </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Parana </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Sao </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paulo </LOCATION>. These states accounted for about 92 percent of <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>'s soybean area in 1977 _ but less than 64 percent in 1986. `` Therefore, it is no more correct to talk of the traditional region as typical of Brazilian production than it is to talk of the Corn Belt-Lake States region as typical of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> production,'' the report said. Variable costs of production range from $ 102 per ton in <LOCATION> Sao </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paulo </LOCATION> to $ 203 in <LOCATION> Bahia </LOCATION>, one of the regions of soybean expansion. `` In absolute terms,'' the report said, `` these cost figures indicate that <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>'s cash expenses are high relative to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and that <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>'s soybean expansion has occurred despite high variable costs of production.'' The report added: `` One obvious hypothesis is that the low cost of land is driving the expansion of soybeans in <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>.''

 The <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> says the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has bought 550,000 metric tons of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> corn for delivery in the 1988-89 marketing year that began on Sept. 1, the first in almost three months. Although <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> has been buying <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> wheat regularly under an export subsidy program, it was the first significant corn purchase since Jan. 4, officials said Tuesday. The corn, which is not subsidized under the export program, is scheduled for delivery by Sept. 30, the end of the sixth year of a long-term grain supply agreement between the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Officials said the latest sales brought total corn sold to the Soviets for 1988-89 to more than 10.7 million tons. Additionally, sales include 4 million tons of wheat, 450,000 tons of soybeans, 1.4 million tons of soybean meal, and 507,400 tons of grain sorghum. A metric ton is about 2,205 pounds and is equal to 39.4 bushels of corn or 36.7 bushels of wheat or soybeans. The 550,000 tons of corn would be about 21.7 million bushels. Corn prices have been averaging about $ 2.61 per bushel at the farm level, according to <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> estimates, meaning that the latest sale could have a farm value of around $ 1.4 million.

 <ORGANIZATION> Bekins </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and 11 of its employees were fined $ 18,250 for making illegal contributions to Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON>'s 1984 Democratic presidential campaign, federal records show. The contributions, amounting to $ 3,750, broke the law because the company paid the employees for making them, according to <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Election </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> records made available Tuesday. Corporations are not allowed to contribute to presidential or congressional campaigns. `` Most of the 15 employee-contributors were reimbursed, some through ` grossing up' of their annual incentive bonuses and some through their expense accounts,'' said a report by the commission's general counsel `` Some employees who received reimbursement did not even know they were reimbursed.'' The contributions began after <PERSON> Irwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Bekins </ORGANIZATION>' parent company, <ORGANIZATION> Minstar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, asked <PERSON> Bekins </PERSON>' president at the time, <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Labinger </PERSON>, to solicit contributions for the <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> campaign, the report said <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON> also was a member of the <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> campaign's finance committee. Some of those who were asked to give money to the campaign said that they felt pressured to do so, the commission's report said. The company agreed to pay a $ 4,000 fine, and <PERSON> Labinger </PERSON> agreed to a $ 4,500 fine, and <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>, who was <PERSON> Bekins </PERSON>' chief financial officer at the time, agreed to pay a $ 5,000 fine. <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Hartman </PERSON>, the company's general counsel, was fined $ 2,000 and <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Morse </PERSON>, a vice president for personnel, paid a $ 1,000 fine, the commission said. Seven other employees each agreed to pay $ 250 fines. On a separate matter, a political action committee organized to support the causes of former President <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> agreed to pay a $ 1,500 fine for accepting $ 15,000 from state organizations that could have received the money in ways that are legal at the state level but are not allowed in federal campaigns. The <ORGANIZATION> Gerald </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> R. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> _ <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Leadership </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> received $ 5,000 contributions each from the re-election campaign of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Clements </PERSON>, the 1986 <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> gubernatorial campaign of <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Leroy </PERSON> and the 1986 campaign of <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Hayden </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> permit corporations to give money directly to political candidates and <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> allows individuals to give unlimited amounts to candidates, the commission said. In addition to prohibiting corporate contributions to federal campaigns, the national law also limits individuals to giving no more than $ 1,000 per election to any one candidate. The commission found that the <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> committee broke the law by mingling that money with cash intended to support candidates for federal office. Both the <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> case and the <PERSON> Bekins </PERSON> case were settled in the past few months, but the files had remained sealed until Tuesday.

 The Pointer Sisters are looking for a new record label and are talking with <ORGANIZATION> Motown </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Records </ORGANIZATION>, said June Pointer. Their last two albums _ `` Hot Together'' and `` Serious Slammin'' _ sold poorly because they did n't get the proper attention from <ORGANIZATION> RCA </ORGANIZATION>, leading to the group's split with the label, said Ms. <PERSON> Pointer </PERSON>, who performs with her sisters, <PERSON> Bonnie </PERSON>, <PERSON> Anita </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ruth </PERSON>.

But their 1973 debut album went gold, and by 1976, the sisters became the first black women to perform at the Grand Ole Opry with their first Grammy winning song `` Fairy Tale.'' They received two Grammys in 1983, for the singles `` Jump'' and `` Automatic.'' Although their father died in 1979, their parents saw the group make those first stabs at success and gave their daughters their blessing to perform, Ms. <PERSON> Pointer </PERSON> said. `` After the turnaround, when we had health insurance and money in the bank, then they could come to the shows and enjoy themselves,'' she said.

 A Spanish court has acquitted flamenco star <PERSON> Lola </PERSON> <PERSON> Flores </PERSON> of tax fraud charges, handing the government a setback in its highly publicized campaign to crack down on tax evaders. But court officials said Tuesday the <ORGANIZATION> Madrid </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Provincial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruled <PERSON> Flores </PERSON> could be subject to administrative sanctions for failing to file tax returns between 1982 and 1985. The officials did not say how much she would have to pay. About $ 1.3 million had been sought in back taxes and penalties from <LOCATION> Flores </LOCATION> and up to two years in prison. During her trial this month, <PERSON> Flores </PERSON> said she did not have money to pay off the tax ministry, adding she never thought she would be prosecuted for what she called an innocent mistake. <PERSON> Flores </PERSON>, 66, starred as a Gypsy girl in numerous films in the 1940s and 1950s that popularized abroad the image of a poor but happy Spaniard dancing the flamenco.

<TEXT>
 A man convicted in three slayings won a reprieve from death from a federal appeals court 33 hours before he was scheduled to become the first person executed by hanging in the nation since 1965. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Bauer </PERSON>, a prison administrative assistant, said <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodman </PERSON> <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON> responded to a letter informing him of the ruling by laughing and saying, `` It's about time.'' A three-judge panel of the 9th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday agreed to stay the execution after <ORGANIZATION> Campbell </ORGANIZATION>'s attorneys filed a notice of appeal and briefs with the court earlier in the day. `` We're surprised and disappointed,'' said assistant state attorney general <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Hansen </PERSON>, who said the court ruled without hearing the state's arguments. `` We were just getting ready to fax the documents when we got the ruling.'' Even if the appeal fails, <PERSON> Hansen </PERSON> said the earliest date for execution could be a year from now. <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON> had exhausted his bid for a stay in state courts. A federal appeal was rejected Monday by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Coughenour </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>, who said he found no merit in <ORGANIZATION> Campbell </ORGANIZATION>'s claim that his trial lawyers ineffectively represented him `` I am very, very pleased,'' said defense attorney <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Lyon </PERSON>. `` That goes without saying. It has been a lot of late, late nights.'' <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON> had been scheduled to hang just after midnight Thursday morning at <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> <LOCATION> State </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Penitentiary </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Walla </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Walla </LOCATION>. He would have been the first person executed by hanging in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> since <ORGANIZATION> Kansas </ORGANIZATION> put four men to death in 1965, including <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> Hickock </PERSON> and <PERSON> Perry </PERSON> <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, whose story was told in Truman Capote's book `` In Cold Blood.'' Hanging is <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s official form of execution, although a prisoner may opt for lethal injection. <ORGANIZATION> Campbell </ORGANIZATION> so far has decided not to choose injection. <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON>, 34, was convicted of three counts of aggravated first-degree murder for the 1982 throat slashings of <PERSON> Renae </PERSON> <PERSON> Wicklund </PERSON>, 31; her 8-year-old daughter, <PERSON> Shannah </PERSON>, and a neighbor, <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Hendrickson </PERSON>, 51. At the time of the killings, <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON> was on work-release from a prison sentence for a sexual assault on Ms. <PERSON> Wicklund </PERSON> in 1976. She and Mrs. <PERSON> Hendrickson </PERSON> had testified at his trial in 1978. The last person executed in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state was <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Chester </PERSON> <PERSON> Self </PERSON>, hanged June 20, 1963, for killing a <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> cab driver. He was the 73rd man executed in state history. <ORGANIZATION> Campbell </ORGANIZATION> is one of seven men on <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s death row.

<HEAD>Dollar Up Slightly, Shares Up To New High</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar edged up against the Japanese yen Wednesday, while share prices rose to a new high on the <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. The dollar closed at 133.25 yen, up 0.35 yen from Tuesday's 132.90-yen finish The currency opened at 133.50 yen and moved in a range between 133.10 yen and 133.50 yen. The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, which gained 793.96 points Tuesday to score the largest single-day gain this year, added another 430.92 points, or 1.33 percent, to finish trading at 32,737.28, yet another high. The market's main index continued to rise after Tuesday's sharp gain, boosted by a strong buying mood, dealers said. Investors have been buying stocks actively since Tuesday, which marked the start of the new business year, when a rise in buy orders is common, said one dealer with a major securities firm, speaking on condition of anonymity. On the foreign exchange market, traders said the dollar was bullish despite joint intervention overnight by the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Western European central banks to halt the currency's recent rise. Although there was no incentive to buy the yen, the dollar was lower toward the end of Wednesday's morning session due to dollar-selling by speculative investors looking for a profit, said a trader with the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION>, also speaking anonymously. Another trader said the dollar was unlikely to keep rising because participants have begun speculating that the <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> will call for dollar-selling and prepare to intervene in the market. Finance Minister <PERSON> Tatsuo </PERSON> <PERSON> Murayama </PERSON> indicated possible central bank intervention early Wednesday at a press conference, after a special Cabinet meeting, and repeated his comments Tuesday that the current yen-dollar rate should `` be viewed with caution.'' The yen-selling trend has been widely attributed to the ongoing Recruit stock trading scandal. On Tuesday, <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> prosecutors arrested a second public official, former Vice Minister of Education <PERSON> Kunio </PERSON> <PERSON> Takaishi </PERSON>, in connection with the scandal, bringing to 13 the number arrested to date. <ORGANIZATION> Recruit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, a fast-growing information-service conglomerate, sold bargain-priced unlisted shares in a real estate subsidiary to more than 150 government officials, politicians and business executives who later reaped large profits after the value of the shares soared in over-the-counter trading. Prosecutors have charged that the transactions constituted bribery in return for favors.

<DATELINE>KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Aminullah </PERSON> was playing near the airport when a blazing point of light descended from the sky and burned his face, arms and legs. The device doctors say will leave <PERSON> Aminullah </PERSON> scarred for life was one of the thousands of flares unleashed daily by airplanes over <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> to deflect the heat-seeking missiles fired by anti-communist guerrillas. The flares, which arc out of the sky trailing a plume of white smoke, are a common sight _ as much a part of the <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> panorama as the snow-capped mountains surrounding the city of mud-brick houses and open sewers. But they are still a mystery to <PERSON> Aminullah </PERSON> and his mother, <PERSON> Gul </PERSON> <PERSON> Babu </PERSON>, a widow with three other children. `` There is no special warning program about the flares,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Lal </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> who attends burn victims at the <LOCATION> Indira </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gandhi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Children </LOCATION><LOCATION> 's </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>. `` We tell the women who bring their children here to spread the word to the others.'' He said as many as six children are admitted each week to the Gandhi hospital with severe burns caused by the flares that are fired or dropped by Afghan military and civilian planes and Soviet cargo planes. No statistics are available on the total number of flare victims in the <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> area. <PERSON> Aminullah </PERSON>, who like many Afghans does not use a family name, sat on a table in the burn ward, his arms held stiffly in front of him as doctors applied solutions. The top half of his face, from the scalp to the bridge of his nose, was a brown crust with glistening red cracks. Burned tissue had been removed from his cheeks and chin, which were a translucent pink. He cried as a doctor snipped at flaps of dangling burn tissue. Eight other children in the room had similar burns and were varying states of recovery. <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> said most of the flare victims suffered second-degree burns and their wounds usually were not life-threatening. But to be a child in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> is not easy, even in peacetime. According to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Children </ORGANIZATION>'s Fund, 30 percent of all children born in the country die before the age of five. Diseases claim most of the youngsters. In 1960, when there was relative peace in this nation of constant political and tribal feuds, harsh winters and 75 percent illiteracy, the child mortality rate was 38 percent. Government-operated television shows the children of war almost every night as it denounces the U.S.-backed guerrillas who are fighting to overthrow the Marxist government of President <PERSON> Najib </PERSON>. The decade-old war has claimed an estimated one million lives from the pre-war population of 15 million. The government seldom fails to say that victims of a guerrilla attack `` included many women and children.'' On Sunday, the government said the guerrillas had rocketed a bus on the Jalalabad-Kabul highway, killing all the passengers `` including women and children.'' No death toll was given but <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Nabi </PERSON> <PERSON> Amani </PERSON> said the bus was carrying at least 22 people. <PERSON> Amani </PERSON> said Monday an unknown number of the passengers survived, but no death toll was given. On Tuesday, foreign reporters were taken to the <LOCATION> Gandhi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> to see survivors of the attack. Hospital staffers said they were treating two survivors _ 10-year-old <PERSON> Shafiullah </PERSON> and <PERSON> Abbasi </PERSON>, 4 _ but adult victims were taken to other hospitals. The total number of dead and injured was not known. <PERSON> Shafiullah </PERSON> and <PERSON> Abbasi </PERSON> received shrapnel wounds in their legs, according to Dr. <PERSON> Ashraf </PERSON>, head of the 250-bed hospital's orthopedic section. <PERSON> Shafiullah </PERSON> was whimpering into the pillow. The doctor said he had just learned that his mother and two brothers died in the attack. <PERSON> Ashraf </PERSON> said <PERSON> Abbasi </PERSON>'s uncle and cousin were killed. Relatives of the victims said the boys were not on a bus. Instead, one said, they were riding in a convoy of trucks carrying people out of <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION>, where the guerrillas have been besieging government forces for three weeks.

 President <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> <PERSON> Tae-woo </PERSON> ordered 49 top generals transferred or retired after army hardliners criticized him for seeking ties with communist nations and not suppressing dissidents, officials said today. <PERSON> Roh </PERSON>, a former general who played a key role in the military's seizure of power in 1980, replaced several hardliners in key security posts with generals loyal to him, according to Korean press reports Many of the generals being replaced were allies of former authoritarian President <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> <PERSON> Doo-hwan </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> officials said a major shuffle had been ordered in the army's high command but would not elaborate, declining to say how many of the 49 generals would be retired or moved to other posts. Details of the shakeup appeared today in all <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> newspapers, which also said a further shakeup of the army's divisional commanders was expected to be announced in coming weeks. <ORGANIZATION> Dong-a </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ilbo </ORGANIZATION>, a leading national newspaper, said a Cabinet shuffle was also expected. In a separate development, the national news agency <ORGANIZATION> Yonhap </ORGANIZATION> reported that the heads of at least two <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> intelligence agencies may be fired for failing to prevent a visit to communist <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> by a top dissident leader. The military shakeup, expected to be carried out in April, came after reports that hardliners in the government and military were unhappy with what they saw as <PERSON> Roh </PERSON>'s failure to curb anti-government radicals and his drive to build ties with communist countries. Several of the changes involve key security commands in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> which are seen as vital to defending the government against any internal military threat. The army has been a major force in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> politics and twice seized power in the nation's 40-year history. Opposition parties said the shakeup would prevent the military from meddling in politics. <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Dae-jung </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democracy </ORGANIZATION> said hardliners had been trying to `` deter the military's political neutrality. <PERSON> Roh </PERSON>, who won presidential elections in December 1987, has attempted to pursue a moderate policy and helped introduce broad democratic reforms. But the government has not won the broad support <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> has sought. <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> announced March 20 that he was indefinitely postponing a promised referendum on his tenure, charging that leftist radicals were attempting to stage a revolution. He also ordered a major crackdown on the radical groups to end a spate of violent protests. But some political observers said it was unclear if <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> could have won the referendum and a defeat would probably have forced him to call new elections. Indications of the hardliners' unhappiness with <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> had been increasing in recent weeks. A leading Cabinet hardliner, Administration Minister <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Yong-kap </PERSON>, resigned this month after criticizing the government as not adequately suppressing anti-government dissidents. Then, last week, the commandant of the country's military academy, Lt. Gen. <PERSON> Min </PERSON> <PERSON> Byong-don </PERSON>, failed to salute <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> at annual graduation ceremonies and made a speech criticizing government efforts to establish ties with communist nations. Min is among generals to be retired under the shuffle, newspapers said. Such staunchly anti-communist generals are reportedly unhappy with <PERSON> Roh </PERSON>'s drive to build political and trade relations with communist nations so as to east the confrontation with <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> has never had relations with communist nations. This week, senior generals issued an unprecedented statement demanding that leading dissident <PERSON> Moon </PERSON> <PERSON> Ik-hwan </PERSON> be punished for making an illegal visit to <PERSON> North </PERSON> <PERSON> KoreaMoon </PERSON> reportedly met Monday with North Korean leader <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Il </PERSON> <PERSON> Sung </PERSON> to discuss reuniting the two Koreas. The two Koreas are bls and <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Il </PERSON> <PERSON> Sung </PERSON> ordered the 1950 invasion that started the Kan War. The <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> government said <PERSON> Moon </PERSON> was trying to undermine its authority anarned he would be arrested if he returned home. A number of eportedly involved in the shuffle were hardliners appointed by <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> just beforehe left power iRoh and <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> had been close allies, but their relations were strained after <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> distanced himself from <PERSON> Chun </PERSON>'s authoritarian rule in 1987.

 More than 5,000 Palestinian fighters are massing in southern <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> in a major buildup that could threaten Israeli settlements near the border, <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> military commanders say. The officers spoke to journalists visiting Israeli's self-designated security zone on Tuesday, when Palestinian fighters blew up an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> outpost and a second guerrilla squad was reported captured in the zone Lebanese police said a remote-controlled explosion leveled a two-story building used by the Israeli army and its allied militia, known as the <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lebanon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, on the eastern edge of the Israeli buffer zone. A police spokesman said two <ORGANIZATION> SLA </ORGANIZATION> militiamen were injured and an armored personnel carrier was destroyed in the blast at the <LOCATION> Zumarraya </LOCATION> crossing point into the <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> zone, 1.8 miles north of the Lebanese town of <LOCATION> Hasbaya </LOCATION>. The spokesman, who can not be identified under standing rules, said guerrillas of the radical <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> faction <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> for the Liberation of <LOCATION> Palestine </LOCATION> were responsible. Israeli officials described the target as a bunker and said only one <ORGANIZATION> SLA </ORGANIZATION> militiaman was injured in the blast. Israeli military commanders said <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> fighters were staging a major buildup just north of the Israeli-controlled zone. Brig. Gen. <PERSON> Nehamiya </PERSON> <PERSON> Tamari </PERSON>, commander of troops stationed along the 100-mile-long Israeli border, estimated the number of guerrillas to be about 5,000, of whom about 600 to 700 were in refugee camps around the Lebanese city of Tyre. `` The importance is not their numbers, whether it's 5,000 or 6,000, but the type of threat that they pose,'' he said. `` If they make it hard for people to live -LRB- in northern <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> -RRB-, we will have to make some kind of decision about an operation.'' Other commanders also referred to the Palestinian threat and said that in the past three months, 29 guerrillas were killed in 10 attempts to infiltrate <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. Israeli sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, suggested that a successful Palestinian attack on civilians across the border could prompt <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s army to launch a ground operation to uproot the <LOCATION> Palestinians </LOCATION> in the Tyre area, 14 miles north of the border. Capt. <PERSON> Avi </PERSON> <PERSON> Hai </PERSON>, an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> officer who briefed the journalists, also warned of possible retaliation by <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s army. `` The <ORGANIZATION> IDF </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- will hit and hit hard Palestinian centers if these centers will turn into a threat to the northern border,'' he said. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> invaded south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> in 1978 to drive out <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> guerrillas and in 1982 staged a major invasion north to <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> to force <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> from his power base in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. The 1982 war in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> led to a three-year occupation of the Lebanese south, which ended in 1985 with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> creating the six-to 10-mile zone to protect its northern settlements. Tuesday's tour of the region was the first such army-sponsored trip in more than six months. Reporters traveled in four trucks guarded by two armored personnel carriers, four jeeps and a truckload of soldiers. At <PERSON> Ras </PERSON> <PERSON> Al-Bayada </PERSON>, the entrance to the security zone on the coast six miles from the border, <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> officials displayed the weapons carried by the two guerrillas captured Tuesday near the town of <PERSON> Bint </PERSON> <PERSON> Jbail </PERSON>. Included were two U.S.-made anti-tank weapons, two Soviet-made AK-47 assault rifles, nine clips of ammunition and three hand grenades. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio said one of the captured guerrillas was a member of <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Fatah </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> faction and the other belonged to the Syrian-based <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> for the Liberation of <LOCATION> Palestine </LOCATION>. On a mountain ridgeline west of <PERSON> Ras </PERSON> <PERSON> Al-Bayada </PERSON>, an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> officer identified only as Lt. Col. Udi pointed out the sprawling Rashadiya refugee camp near Tyre, where he said many Palestinian guerrillas were hiding. He said the guerrillas lacked the long-range artillery needed to strike either the security zone or <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> itself. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s northern army commander, Maj. Gen. <PERSON> Yossi </PERSON> <PERSON> Peled </PERSON>, said only one rocket attack against <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> had been reported so far this year, compared to 26 last year and 80 in 1986. The largest weapons the guerrillas have are 107mm Katyusha rockets and 60mm heavy mortars, neither of which could span the six miles separating his outpost from the guerrilla camp, Udi said. `` In order for them to strike us, they would have to advance out of their camps,'' said Udi, standing behind a coil of barbed wire at the edge of a deep, jagged ravine that provided a natural barrier to any attack.

 The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s leading young chess player and his father have met with an <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> official and asked for political asylum, according to a grandmaster and fellow Soviet defector who aided them. <PERSON> Gata </PERSON> <PERSON> Kamsky </PERSON>, 14, and his father, <PERSON> Rustam </PERSON> <PERSON> Kamsky </PERSON>, sought asylum Tuesday and were staying in the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> area, said <PERSON> Grandmaster </PERSON> <PERSON> Lev </PERSON> <PERSON> Alburt </PERSON>, a former <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> chess champion who defected from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> a decade ears ago. World champion <PERSON> Garri </PERSON> <PERSON> Kasparov </PERSON> and other experts have said <PERSON> Kamsky </PERSON> is likely to reach the highest echelons of world chess. `` America finally has a potential super-grandmaster, who, five years from now, could challenge for the world championship,'' said <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Parr </PERSON>, a former editor of Chess Life and Review. <PERSON> Gata </PERSON> <PERSON> Kamsky </PERSON> was the youngest member of a prominent Soviet chess delegation participating in the New York Open tournament, which ended Tuesday. `` His decision was made, in my judgment, even before he came here,'' Alburt said. `` It was finalized while he was here. When I learned about his plans I called the <ORGANIZATION> Jamestown </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and they brought me in touch with a person in the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. He interviewed them before the game and offered protection.'' After speaking with the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> official, <PERSON> Kamsky </PERSON>, who tied for first place in the championship of <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION> two years ago, went on to beat <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolff </PERSON>, an American international master, in the final round. Alburt, 43, said the other Soviet players at the tournament were unaware the Kamskys were about to defect. The <ORGANIZATION> Jamestown </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>, founded in 1983, promotes high-level defections from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and provides career counseling and other help to defectors. <PERSON> Alburt </PERSON> said it had helped with the defection of <PERSON> Arkady </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevchenko </PERSON>, the former Soviet representative at the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>. The chief of the Soviet delegation, <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Roschal </PERSON>, a prominent chess journalist, was not at the tournament site when the news broke. A member of the delegation said on condition of anonymity that <PERSON> Kamsky </PERSON> had always been treated well by the Soviet sports authorities. `` I ca n't understand why his father did this,'' the Soviet said. <PERSON> Alburt </PERSON> said <PERSON> Kamsky </PERSON>'s parents were divorced, and his father had remarried. They hoped the elder <PERSON> Kamsky </PERSON>'s second wife would eventually gain permission to join them in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, he said. Since the formation of the international chess federation in 1948 and the creation of the modern world championship, seven of the eight titleholders have been Soviet. The exception was American <PERSON> Bobby </PERSON> <PERSON> Fischer </PERSON>, who became champion in 1972 but refused to defend his title in 1975 and has never competed since. <PERSON> Kamsky </PERSON> joins a celebrated list of leading Soviet and East European chess players who have defected to the West. They include <PERSON> Viktor </PERSON> <PERSON> Korchnoi </PERSON>, a former world championship finalist who lives in and plays for <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>; Alburt; and International Master <PERSON> Igor </PERSON> <PERSON> Ivanov </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>'s second-ranked player. In August, <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>'s top player, Grandmaster <PERSON> Mihai </PERSON> <PERSON> Suba </PERSON>, was granted political asylum in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> during a competition. He competed in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> with a Union Jack by his board. Other leading Soviet players have emigrated legally or left in other ways. Former world champion <PERSON> Boris </PERSON> <PERSON> Spassky </PERSON>, who lost his championship crown to <PERSON> Fischer </PERSON>, married a Moscow-based French diplomat and now represents that country. In November in <LOCATION> Salonica </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Elena </PERSON> <PERSON> Akhmylovskaya </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s second highest ranked woman player, eloped with the captain of the American men's team, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Donaldson </PERSON>, and now lives with him in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>.

 <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s leading law officials today drew a bleak picture of a nation beset by rising violent crime, rampant profiteering in scarce goods, official corruption and increased juvenile delinquency. In annual reports to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s legislature, the officials also acknowledged thousands of instances where false confessions were extracted through torture or frameups <PERSON> Ren </PERSON> <PERSON> Jianxin </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, said <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> courts sentenced 368,790 people last year, 13 percent more than 1987. In sharp contrast, courts acquitted just 2,039 defendants. <PERSON> Ren </PERSON> said 113,533 convicted offenders were sentenced to death or prison terms of five years to life. He said 101 embezzlers and bribe-takers were sentenced to death or life in prison. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> does not give specific figures for executions, although the number is believed to be well over 1,000 a year. <PERSON> Ren </PERSON> said murder cases in 1988 were up 9.1 percent, robbery cases 43.1 percent and cases of serious larceny 63.8 percent. He did not give a breakdown of the crimes. `` While public order is generally stable across the country, many problems and unstable factors still remain,'' he said. He called for `` heavy blows'' against those who `` gravely jeopardize public order.'' Despite harsh punishments, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> has been plagued by a crime wave in recent years resulting from greater social mobility, less government controls over people's lives and growing income disparities as the nation switches to a market-oriented economy. <PERSON> Liu </PERSON> <PERSON> Fuzhi </PERSON>, the country's chief prosecutor, said his offices arrested 8,777 on charges of corruption and handled 40,000 cases of infringement of people's rights by government officials or law enforcement officers, a rise of 7.8 percent from 1987. Among these, there were 4,700 cases where police were guilty of extortion, torture, frameups and unlawful detentions. <PERSON> Liu </PERSON> said 227 cases led to disability and death. <PERSON> Ren </PERSON> also said youths between the ages of 14 and 18 accounted for 8.9 percent of convicted offenders in 1988, up 13.8 percent. He said there were 74,923 convictions for economic offenses such as profiteering in scarce or price-controlled goods, hoarding scarce commodities and reselling prized imports like autos and stereos for big profits.

<DATELINE>BRASELTON, Ga. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Actress <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Basinger </PERSON> has purchased <LOCATION> Braselton </LOCATION> from the family that founded it in 1876, and a real estate broker said she might establish a movie production company in the tiny northeast <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> town. <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Braselton </PERSON> <PERSON> Sr. </PERSON> said Tuesday that his family agreed to sell 1,800 acres of property _ including the town's industrial park, shopping center and bank _ for $ 20 million to Miss <PERSON> Basinger </PERSON>, a native of nearby <LOCATION> Hart </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>. The deal's closing will come later this year, <LOCATION> Braselton </LOCATION> said. `` I've worked with <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> on this for quite some time, about 18 months,'' said <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Morris </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Braselton </LOCATION> real estate broker who handled the deal. <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> said <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Basinger </PERSON> has expressed an interest in developing <LOCATION> Braselton </LOCATION> into a tourist center, and possibly establishing a movie production company. Attempts to contact Miss <PERSON> Basinger </PERSON> and her representatives were unsuccessful Tuesday. <LOCATION> Braselton </LOCATION>, a town of 500 people about 40 miles north of <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, has been virtually controlled by the <LOCATION> Braselton </LOCATION> family since <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON> <PERSON> Braselton </PERSON> founded it in 1876. The property first was offered for sale five years ago for $ 14 million. But the price jumped after Chateau Elan winery and a <ORGANIZATION> Mitsubishi </ORGANIZATION> plant located in the area. `` We're relieved we found somebody we think will do good for the community,'' <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Braselton </PERSON> said. `` There were tears shed this morning, when we told the employees. We hate to divest ourselves of a longtime loved entity, but it has to happen. We've all gotten old, and it's time for younger people to take over.'' He said the family wanted to sell because most of the Braseltons are elderly and none of the younger family members wanted to hold onto the land. But they had turned down numerous offers for the town, he said. `` The primary difficulty was the terms,'' <LOCATION> Braselton </LOCATION> said. `` People wanted 40 years -LRB- to pay -RRB-. To people in their 70s and 80s, that does n't interest them. We got a cash deal.'' The 34-year-old Miss <PERSON> Basinger </PERSON> grew up in <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION> but left at age 17 for <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> to become a model. From there, she went into acting, starring in such movies as `` The Natural,'' and `` 9 -LCB- Weeks.'' She also stars in the soon-to-be-released film `` Batman.''

 An assailant who tried to have his victim kept alive on a life-support system said he will not appeal a judge's decision rejecting his request, even though he may face a murder charge as a result. <PERSON> Noel </PERSON> <PERSON> Pagan </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Wellesley </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, wanted to prevent <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Weaver </PERSON>'s mother from removing the feeding tube that has kept <PERSON> Weaver </PERSON> alive since a 1985 stabbing in <LOCATION> Lewiston </LOCATION> Pagan, 29, served three years in prison for aggravated assault but still could face a murder charge when <PERSON> Weaver </PERSON> dies. Probate Court Judge <PERSON> Dana </PERSON> <PERSON> Childs </PERSON> ruled Tuesday that Pagan could not intervene in the case because his interest in preventing <PERSON> Weaver </PERSON>'s death has nothing to do with the family's request that <PERSON> Weaver </PERSON> die peacefully. `` Mr. <PERSON> Pagan </PERSON>'s only claim to being an interested party stems from the possibility that when <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Weaver </PERSON> suffers death following the withdrawal of treatment, Pagan may be charged with <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Weaver </PERSON>'s murder,'' the judge wrote <PERSON> Weaver </PERSON>'s mother, <PERSON> Sylvia </PERSON> <PERSON> Lane </PERSON>, said she would proceed with plans to remove the feeding tube Thursday. <PERSON> Weaver </PERSON>, 26, has been kept alive with the tube for nearly four years since his stab wounds left him in a vegetative state. <PERSON> Lane </PERSON> said she was pleased with the judge's decision Tuesday because it was her son's wish that he not be kept alive artificially. `` I do n't see how he -LRB- Pagan -RRB- had any right to decide what happens to his victim,'' she said. Pagan's attorney, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Mullen </PERSON>, said he had told his client that an appeal would mean the case `` would drag out for months, and I could n't tell him when it was going to stop.'' He said <PERSON> Pagan </PERSON> had agreed that it was in nobody's interest to appeal the ruling. The attorney general's office said it will not decide whether to file charges until after the death. `` Until there's a death, there's no cause of death,'' spokesman <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheever </PERSON> said Tuesday. State Deputy Attorney General <PERSON> Fernand </PERSON> <PERSON> LaRochelle </PERSON> said Monday that Pagan could be charged with murder if <PERSON> Weaver </PERSON> dies because it would not be the same crime as assault. The Constitution protects defendants from being prosecuted twice for the same offense.

<HEAD>World War II Vet Faces Charges For Painting Over Swastika Grafitti</HEAD>
<DATELINE>UNION CITY, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A World War II veteran who got tired of waiting for housing officials to clean away swastika grafitti in his building has been charged with criminal mischief for painting over the symbols, police said today. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Stahl </PERSON>, a 25-year resident of the Hillside housing project, said he made complaints for seven months about the grafitti to the city's <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION>. But he said nothing was done to remove or cover the swastikas. A police official said today the charge was lodged against <PERSON> Stahl </PERSON> in December by the housing agency and that <PERSON> Stahl </PERSON> was due in Municipal Court on Thursday. If convicted, he could be sentenced to a maximum six months in prison and a $ 1,000 fine, the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> reported today. <PERSON> Stahl </PERSON>, a 59-year-old truck dispatcher, said he decided to paint over the Nazi symbols himself because he was touched by the reaction of an elderly Jewish resident to seeing a swastika in an elevator. `` I said, ` Why are you crying?''' <PERSON> Stahl </PERSON> said. `` She pointed to the swastika and said a relative of hers had died in the Holocaust. I could see how she hurt,'' said <PERSON> Stahl </PERSON>, who according to the newspaper is not Jewish. `` Enough is enough. After being yessed to death by <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION> officials who promised to take care of the problem for seven months, I decided I had to take the matter into my own hands,'' he said. <PERSON> Stahl </PERSON> said that about 20 minutes after painting over swastikas in the elevator and in an eighth floor hallway, someone slipped a notice under his door ordering him to report to the Housing Authority office. He said he was met there by by <PERSON> Virgilio </PERSON> <PERSON> Cabello </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION> director, who told him he would face charges. Cabello's secretary told the newspaper he had no comment.

<HEAD>Medical Manufacturer Agrees To Pay $764,000 In Penalties</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A medical equipment manufacturer has pleaded guilty to criminal charges of selling thousands of defective pacemakers and corrosive batteries and has agreed to pay $ 764,000 in penalties. <ORGANIZATION> Cordis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which last week agreed to pay $ 5 million to settle a separate civil-fraud claim brought by the government, pleaded guilty Tuesday to 12 felony counts and 13 misdemeanors in the second case. Four executives of the Miami-based concern still face a criminal trial set for September over the defective pacemakers. <ORGANIZATION> Cordis </ORGANIZATION>, which sold its pacemaker division in 1987, was accused of distributing 2,200 faulty pacemakers and 6,000 batteries prone to corrosion between December 1983 and October 1985. Charges filed by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> claimed the pacemakers, which are planted under the skin to regulate heartbeat, could stop without warning. But no reports of medical emergencies are known because of the Cordis devices. Negotiations for the plea began last year between the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Cordis </ORGANIZATION>. A first accord between the two sides was rejected last October by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcus </PERSON>. The company's offer to plead guilty to 24 counts and pay $ 264,000 in fines and costs was insufficient, <PERSON> Marcus </PERSON> said at the time. But <PERSON> Marcus </PERSON> accepted the new deal, which included another felony charge _ with a $ 500,000 penalty for intent to defraud the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> by failing to provide required notice of the devices' adverse field reports. Sentencing in the criminal case against <ORGANIZATION> Cordis </ORGANIZATION> was set for April 25. <PERSON> Marcus </PERSON> is not bound by the restrictions of the plea agreement. The $ 5 million settlement the company agreed to last week came in a civil claim by the <ORGANIZATION> Veterans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> VA </ORGANIZATION> sought reimbursement for an undisclosed number of the defective pacemakers it had bought. The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday's civil settlement was one of the largest Medicare recoveries ever. According to <ORGANIZATION> Cordis </ORGANIZATION> lawyer <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hall </PERSON>, the company had paid $ 1 million towards its settlement before Tuesday's agreement. He said the remaining penalty plus interest would be paid within three years. <ORGANIZATION> Cordis </ORGANIZATION> sold its pacemaker business to the Australian medical device manufacturer <ORGANIZATION> Telectronics </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Cordis </ORGANIZATION> now concentrates on making catheters for diagnosing and treating heart problems and gauges for monitoring pressure on the brain. The company reported net losses of $ 56.1 million in 1987, but a major restructuring after the sale of the pacemaker operation brought the company net earnings for 1988 of $ 2.4 million from sales of $ 132 million.

 A severe thunderstorm system churned up several tornadoes and prompted flooding, high winds and golf ball-size hail across much of eastern <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, while rain and thunderstorms hit many other areas of the nation. At least eight tornadoes touched down in eastern <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, and rising waters in <LOCATION> Rusk </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Cherokee </LOCATION> counties southeast of <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> prompted officials to close roads and evacuate at least two apartment complexes, and officers rescued stranded motorists in low-lying areas. `` This is the worst I've ever seen in my whole life and I've been here a long time,'' said <PERSON> Ruby </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>, dispatcher at the Cherokee County Sheriff's office Flood waters on a part of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Highway 69 were as deep as 5 feet Tuesday evening, sending motorists scurrying to the roofs of their cars and into nearby trees, Ms. <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> said.

 <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>'s dismissal of his designated successor and the resignation of two key <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> officials indicates a resurgence of radical fundamentalism in the Islamic republic. The removal of <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Montazeri </PERSON> leaves open who will succeed <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>, now 88 and ailing, when he dies. By dumping the 64-year-old <PERSON> Montazeri </PERSON> as his political and religious heir, <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> has moved to curb so-called liberal figures in the <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> hierarchy and strengthen the hand of hardliners led by Interior Minister <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Akbar </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohtashemi </PERSON>. The political future of Parliament Speaker <PERSON> Hashemi </PERSON> <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON>, leader of the so-called pragmatists, is also now in question. <PERSON> Montazeri </PERSON>, who has in recent weeks openly criticized the shortcomings of the Islamic revolution and called for greater freedoms, announced his resignation Tuesday after <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> asked him to step down. He wrote to <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>: `` The survival and stability of the Islamic republic rests on obeying your orders.'' <PERSON> Montazeri </PERSON>'s removal, and the resignations of deputy Foreign Minister <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Javad </PERSON> <PERSON> Larijani </PERSON> and U.N. Ambassador <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaafar </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahallati </PERSON> in recent days, took place against the backdrop of a determined drive by <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> to swing <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> back to radical fundamentalism. He has sought to revitalize flagging revolutionary fervor in post-war <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> by confronting the West over <PERSON> Salman </PERSON> <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>'s novel `` The Satanic Verses,'' which many Moslems consider blasphemous. <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>'s actions also served the purpose of seriously damaging efforts by <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> and Foreign Minister <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Akbar </PERSON> <PERSON> Velayati </PERSON> to rebuild bridges with the West and end <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s isolation.

There has long been speculation that <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> would likely be ruled by a triumverate of key leaders, including <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON>, after <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> dies, with <PERSON> Montazeri </PERSON> little more than a figurehead. Eighteen months ago, <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> rewrote his political will, to be opened after his death, heightening speculation he sought to diminish <PERSON> Montazeri </PERSON>'s powers in the succession. <PERSON> Montazeri </PERSON>'s recent criticism of the revolution's achievements while the country celebrated the republic's first decade _ the late <PERSON> Shah </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Reza </PERSON> <PERSON> Pahlavi </PERSON> was ousted in 1979 _ came amid an intensifying power struggle between <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> and the hardliners. <PERSON> Montazeri </PERSON> initially rejected <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>'s order that Moslems seek out and kill <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>, but later came out in support the religious decree. <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>, apparently at <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON>'s urging, unconditionally accepted a July 1987 <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> cease-fire resolution after wavering for almost a year. Ending the war was a major boost for <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> and his allies. <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> proclaimed his death sentence on <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> Feb. 14, the day after <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> announced he would run in the presidential elections, a move the hardliners saw as a bid by the speaker for supreme power in the post-Khomeini era. Whether coincidence or not, <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>'s action was a serious blow to <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON>. President <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Khamenei </PERSON>'s second four-year term expires in September. Under the constitution he can not run for a third term.

 Fishermen sporting black armbands told oil industry, federal and state officials that they fear their livelihood _ the <ORGANIZATION> Prince </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> William </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sound </ORGANIZATION> fishery _ may be imperiled by the nation's largest oil spill. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Booren </PERSON>, who fishes in the sound, said fishermen know this year's catch will fetch little money, even if oil damage is contained. Just the publicity will destroy the market for the area's fish, he said. A high school gymnasium, which is the largest meeting place in this town of 2,500, was packed Tuesday night as fishermen, many with families in tow, voiced their anger and apprehensions. `` Some of the old-timers tell me this is the biggest crowd they've seen here since the town turned out to protest the pipeline,'' City Manager <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> said. The town opposed construction of the 800-mile trans-Alaska oil pipeline in the 1970s, <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> said. He spoke in a hallway as a state fish and game official offered yet more bad news on the spread of oil from a grounded tanker that leaked 240,000 barrels of crude into the sea Friday 25 miles from <LOCATION> Port </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valdez </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Cordova </PERSON> is about 50 miles to the southeast. <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> said many fishermen are bitter because their initial offers to help contain the spill went unanswered. He said <ORGANIZATION> Alyeska </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pipeline </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, which has the responsibility for immediate response to oil spills in the sound, had issued emergency telephone numbers prior to the spill. When our fishermen called to offer assistance, nobody would answer the phone at <ORGANIZATION> Alyeska </ORGANIZATION>, he said. The company has said some employees were off in observance of Good Friday the day of the spill. The fishermen now are taking the lead in trying to protect sensitive areas, including three fish hatcheries on islands in the sound. `` I want you to know that we are not going to be able to stop much of the damage,'' said <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Kelso </PERSON>, the state commissioner of environmental conservation. `` This is a very serious spill and a very environmentally complex area.'' <ORGANIZATION> Alyeska </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Cornett </PERSON> were treated with relative restraint by the crowd. `` What's your way of life worth to you?'' a woman shouted at <PERSON> Cornett </PERSON>. `` Not very much tonight,'' he replied. <PERSON> Cornett </PERSON> said he would not try to duck legitimate damage claims filed by fishermen hurt by the spill. <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Zimmermann </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fisheries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said many sea otters will suffer from the spill, but that news was greeted with applause. Fishermen have complained the otter population has reached an intolerable level. They say the animals eat fish otherwise available for harvest by the fishing fleet. So they expressed pleasure when <PERSON> Zimmerman </PERSON> said: `` Some of them are going to go to sea otter heaven in the next few days.''

<HEAD>Egg Experiment On Recent Shuttle Mission Raised Many Questions</HEAD>

 A fertilized egg experiment aboard the recent Discovery flight raised more questions than it answered after half of them returned dead, the shuttle's pilot says. The experiment included 16 chicken eggs fertilized two days before the March 13 blastoff and another 16 fertilized nine days prior to launch. Although all of the older eggs hatched Saturday, the others were found dead when the shuttle returned March 18. Both the hatched chicks and the dead ones are being studied to determine how weightlessness affected them. `` What looked like a very simple experiment may turn out to have generated thousands of questions now instead of providing any answers to anything,'' Discovery pilot <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Blaha </PERSON> said Tuesday at a news conference. `` It's certainly a great mystery as to why this happened.'' Dr. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Bagian </PERSON>, another astronaut on the flight, said the experiment raised questions as to whether plant or animal life can begin in zero gravity. <PERSON> Bagian </PERSON> said the chicken eggs and another experiment in which he observed plant growth were designed to determine if cell division is somehow `` impeded or mutated'' by a lack of gravity. `` Is there a certain point in the differentiation of cell types where they are vulnerable to the effects of the loss of gravity? Maybe gravity plays up to now an unknown role but a very essential role in that the older ones -LRB- eggs -RRB-, at nine days, are past that crucial gate, if you will, and they are developing normally,'' <PERSON> Bagian </PERSON> said. If the experiment shows that `` life can not begin anew in orbit,'' that would have great implications for long space stays in the future, <PERSON> Bagian </PERSON> said. `` You may have to supply a gravity environment for a period of time.'' During the flight, the crew _ which also consisted of commander <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Coats </PERSON> and astronauts <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Buchli </PERSON> and <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Springer </PERSON> _ took 3,000 still photographs and shot nearly three miles of movie film in an effort to document environmentally damaged areas of the <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>. On Tuesday, the crew showed several spectacular views they captured, including shots of a sunset, <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> and the Himalayas. But they also talked about how deforestation, air and water pollution and the effects of droughts can be observed from space. `` I think all of us that have flown come back with a very protective feeling about our planet,'' said Coats. `` All of us come back, I think, with a renewed appreciation of the fact that we've got to protect this planet, there's no place else to go.

 Diners atop a 26-story hotel were ruffled by the sight of a predator munching pigeons outside the window, but managers applauded their guest's good taste after discovering its pedigree. `` We thought it was a hawk,'' <ORGANIZATION> Sheraton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tacoma </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hotel </ORGANIZATION> sales director <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Faulkner </PERSON> said of the bird who liked to bring its own lunch up to the restaurant windowsill. After a number of complaints, hotel managers called the Point Defiance Zoo to find out how to get rid of the messy eater. But when they found out it was a rare peregrine falcon, an endangered species protected by the federal government, they offered it the best perch in the house. On Monday, the hotel issued a news release proudly announcing the falcon's choice of <LOCATION> Tacoma </LOCATION> accommodations, suggesting it was attracted by the hotel's `` unobstructed view of the city and <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rainier </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Houck </PERSON>, curator of mammals and birds at Point Defiance, said the falcon probably regards the hotel as a convenient cliff. `` He's bopping the pigeons along the railroad yards,'' <PERSON> Houck </PERSON> said. `` There's a lot of pigeons down there, and it's pretty easy to make a living, picking them off and taking them back to the ledges of the Sheraton to eat.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Audubon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> says tall buildings and easy pigeon pickings attract a number of the birds to city life. The bird has deserted the restaurant window ledge for the top of the big red `` S'' on the side of the hotel, but Ms. <PERSON> Faulkner </PERSON> says the staff wants it to stick around. `` He really has very good taste,'' she said.

<HEAD>Pravda Calls Vote A Victory For Reform Effort</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> newspaper Pravda today called the parliamentary elections in which party leaders lost in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s three largest cities a victory for reform efforts. `` Voters did not simply vote, like it was earlier, but they really made a choice, giving their preference to candidates whose pre-election platforms suited them better,'' Pravda said. `` Choosing people's deputies, the country voted for perestroika.'' While official results of Sunday's balloting for 1,500 seats in the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> Deputies parliament will not be released for days, party and government officials in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kiev </LOCATION> were voted out by a frustrated public, as were at least 37 local officials around the country. One loser was <PERSON> Yuri </PERSON> <PERSON> Solovyev </PERSON>, a non-voting member of the ruling Politburo who was running unopposed in <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION>. The losses could actually benefit Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> because the balloting emphasizes voters' frustrations with their local party leadership and desires for further reforms. There were notable winners, including <PERSON> Telman </PERSON> <PERSON> Gdlyan </PERSON>, a federal investigator who headed the embezzlement and corruption cases against officials in the Soviet Central Asian republic of <LOCATION> Uzbekistan </LOCATION>, the official news agency <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said today. <PERSON> Gdlyan </PERSON>'s platform included a toughening of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s criminal codes, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> reported <PERSON> Gdlyan </PERSON> captured 87 percent of the vote in a race against four other candidates, the news agency said. Soviet <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Gennady </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON> told a news briefing Tuesday that the losses could not be considered a defeat for the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> because about 80 percent of party members won their races. But he said local party organizations would have to review why party members lost. Reports from the Byelorussian capital <LOCATION> Minsk </LOCATION> and from <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>, two areas where there has been tension over citizens' demands for reform, indicated voters rejected top leaders or just stayed away from the polls. Pravda said the city party leader in <LOCATION> Minsk </LOCATION>, <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Galko </PERSON>, and a first deputy premier of the republic, <PERSON> Y. </PERSON> <PERSON> Khusainov </PERSON>, failed their election bids. Voters also rejected <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leaders of the <LOCATION> Gomel </LOCATION> and Mogilev regions _ two southern areas affected by the 1986 <LOCATION> Chernobyl </LOCATION> nuclear disaster. Many citizens of <LOCATION> Minsk </LOCATION> were angered last fall by tough police action against groups seeking to build a memorial to the victims of <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>'s purges and a nascent <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> grassroots organization. In <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>, voters stayed away from the polls to voice their frustration with a lack of choice, the government newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Izvestia </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday. `` At the very climax of the campaign people asked a question for which they did not receive a convincing answer,'' <ORGANIZATION> Izvestia </ORGANIZATION> said. `` Why did a group of leaders of the republic, nominated as candidates, have no opponents? And many, as a sign of protest, refused to take part in elections without a choice.'' In many parts of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, 85-95 percent of the voters participated, but in <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> the figure was 72 percent. And only 53 percent of the voters of the earthquake-devastated capital <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION> went to the polls. <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> has been the site of frequent turmoil since February 1988 when a dispute arose with neighboring <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION> over control of the <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION> region.

 A Syrian shell struck <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON>'s residence while he was in its bomb shelter, damaging the living quarters but causing no casualties, the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> said today. `` Damage was confined to the living and dining areas and no one was injured in the attack,'' an embassy statement said. An embassy spokeswoman said the attack occurred late Tuesday and that <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON> was in the bomb shelter. The residence in the Christian <LOCATION> Yarze </LOCATION> district is midway between the presidential palace and the defense ministry. Meanwhile, a cease-fire declared today by Christian army commander Gen. <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> after three weeks of fierce artillery clashes with Syrian troops and their Moslem militia allies collapsed a few hours later. A police spokesman said one man was killed and four wounded in a <LOCATION> Syrian </LOCATION> rocket barrage of Christian east <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> earlier in the day. The casualties raised the overall toll to 122 people killed and 376 wounded since March 8, when <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>'s worst civil war clashes in four years broke out. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s headquarters said Syrian gunners were shelling the presidential palace, the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> and neighboring residential districts in <LOCATION> Christian </LOCATION> east <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>, who heads a <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> military cabinet in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s dual government, said he ordered his 20,000 troops to stop shooting at midnight in response to an appeal from the <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION>. There was no public response from the Syrian command or Druse warlord <PERSON> Walid </PERSON> <PERSON> Jumblatt </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Progressive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> militia, <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s main adversaries in the latest round of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s 14-year civil war between Christians and Moslems. A communique issued by <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s headquarters said, `` Despite the army's adherence to the cease-fire ... the Syrian batteries poured shells on eastern -LRB- Christian -RRB- areas as people were emerging from bomb shelters to buy food and take stock of the damage caused to their homes.'' The communique said that <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s troops were not returning fire. However, sniper fire from positions in east <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> hit several streets in both Moslem and <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> sectors. The shellings have triggered an exodus of residents from Moslem west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> and its southern Shiite Moslem slums. Long lines of cars packed with beds, mattresses and suitcases continued to stream from the city's Moslem sector heading south. <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> sources said at least 35,000 Moslem families have sought refuge with relatives and friends in areas policed by <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> peacekeeping forces in south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. The confrontation was sparked when <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> clamped a blockade March 6 on illegal ports operated by Moslem militias along <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> coastline The ports were draining about $ 100 million a year from the five government harbors in lost tax revenues. In retaliation, <PERSON> Jumblatt </PERSON>, Maj. Gen. <PERSON> Samit </PERSON> <PERSON> Khatib </PERSON>'s 22,000-strong Moslem army and the Syrians besieged the 310-square-mile enclave where about 1 million Christians live. <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>, the main powerbroker in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, keeps about 40,000 troops in the country under a 1976 Arab League mandate to end the civil war. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, which maintains a self-designated security zone in south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, has pledged not to interfere in the <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> fighting.

 Thousands of radicals battled riot police with firebombs and rocks today following rallies in support of a top dissident's visit to communist <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> to discuss reunification. Hundreds of riot police fired tear gas and hurled rocks to drive back the protesters in the southern cities of <LOCATION> Taegu </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kwangju </LOCATION> where dissident groups rallied in support of <PERSON> Moon </PERSON> <PERSON> Ik-hwan </PERSON>'s visit, police and witnesses said. The South Korean government has said <PERSON> Moon </PERSON> will be prosecuted if he returns to the south. His visit has sparked major controversy in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, with the government charging that dissidents are trying to undermine its authority. Students gathered at <ORGANIZATION> Chonam </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Kwangju </LOCATION> to denounce President <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> <PERSON> Tae-woo </PERSON>'s government and demand unification. <PERSON> Yonhap </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> news agency, said about 5,000 students took part in the protest. Police opened fire with tear gas when the protesters attempted to march into the streets. About 5,000 radical students and workers attended a rally at <ORGANIZATION> Kyemyong </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Taegu </LOCATION>, where dissident leader <PERSON> Paek </PERSON> <PERSON> Ki-wan </PERSON> said <PERSON> Moon </PERSON> went to <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> to speak for farmers, workers and the poor. He said the <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> government was not interested in unification. Aboput 2,000 protesters then attempted to march into the streets and clashed with riot police blocking the way, police said. Police in <LOCATION> Taegu </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kwangju </LOCATION> said they had no immediate reports of arrests or serious injuries. In <PERSON> Jinju </PERSON> on the southern coast, about 800 students clashed with police in another anti-government protest, but officials said the demonstration was not linked to <PERSON> Moon </PERSON>'s visit. The protest came as South Korean leaders, angered by <PERSON> Moon </PERSON>'s visit, were reconsidering efforts to improve relations with the north Officials have charged the north is trying to undermine the <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> government by having independent contacts with South Korean dissidents. Prime Minister <PERSON> Kang </PERSON> <PERSON> Young-hoon </PERSON> and other government leaders met and agreed to take a `` cautious stand'' in future detente with <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, a government official said, requesting anonymity. <ORGANIZATION> Yonhap </ORGANIZATION> quoted a `` highly-placed'' government source as saying President <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> <PERSON> Tae-woo </PERSON> is considering a cabinet reshuffle to hold security officials responsible for failing to stop the visit. <PERSON> Moon </PERSON> met North Korean President <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Il </PERSON> <PERSON> Sung </PERSON> Monday in <LOCATION> Pyongyang </LOCATION>, the communist capital. Officials in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> say he will be arrested when he returns because he violated <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> law, which forbids unauthorized contact with <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. In a related development, newspapers in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> reported today that the government may call off a scheduled visit to <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> by <PERSON> Chung </PERSON> <PERSON> Ju-yung </PERSON>, founder of one of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s largest business conglomerates, the <ORGANIZATION> Hyundai </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Chung </PERSON> was to visit <LOCATION> Pyongyang </LOCATION> in April for talks on joint ventures with the north, which include a resort development in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Diamond </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountains </LOCATION> on the east coast. He visited <LOCATION> Pyongyang </LOCATION> in January. Both South and <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> governments approved the visit. A government official, speaking on condition of anomymity, said <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> would continue efforts to ease tension on the <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> peninsula and maintain limited contact with the north, but officials were reviewing the impact of <PERSON> Moon </PERSON>'s trip on the inter-Korea dialogue. <PERSON> Roh </PERSON>'s government has been trying to improve relations with the north to ease tension on the peninsula and broaden its trade with other communist nations. The two Koreas technically are still at war nearly four decades after the Korean War ended, with their border sealed, although there have been government-level talks on and off since the early 1970s.

 Voter rejection of a tax increase to pay for a vast expansion of the area's mass transit system will lead only to a worsening of the city's air pollution and traffic congestion, disappointed supporters say. `` I'd say get ready for <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>,'' said campaign coordinator <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Meek </PERSON>. Voters in <LOCATION> Maricopa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> on Tuesday rejected a proposed half-cent sales tax increase by 224,309 votes, or 61 percent, to 143,622 votes, or 39 percent. Approval would have raised the sales tax in most of the county to 7 percent. The 30-year tax increase would have paid for an $ 8.4 billion system dubbed ValTrans that had been hailed by some as the metropolitan area's salvation from traffic jams and smog and condemned by others as a waste of money. The project called for a 103-mile elevated railway, 23 miles of rush-hour train service, freeway lanes for multiple-passenger vehicles and expansion of the bus system from 350 buses to 1,500. `` Obviously this train is not leaving the station,'' said Mayor <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Goddard </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> Regional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION> had projected a $ 44-per-year cost to the average household, but a study by the <ORGANIZATION> Arizona </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tax </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associations </ORGANIZATION> put the cost at $ 82 to $ 107. Politicians leading the drive `` have lost credibility and touch with their constituents,'' said <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, a founder of <ORGANIZATION> Voters </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Against </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senseless </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transit </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> ValTrans </ORGANIZATION> was also pushed as a way to cut auto-insurance rates and allow families to get rid of second or third cars. But opponents said that the <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION> area is too spread out for mass transit and that construction of freeways should have priority. <PERSON> Goddard </PERSON> called the defeat of the project a major setback but said voters turned down the specific proposal and not mass transit in general. He said air pollution and traffic still have to be confronted. `` We're going to have a couple, three more years where we're falling behind in terms of dealing with these problems,'' he said

 <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> has agreed to back loans of up to $ 92 million to build a factory to produce a critical rocket fuel ingredient that has been in short supply since an explosion leveled the manufacturer's plant last May. <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineering </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Production </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday the agreement will pay for an ammonium perchlorate plant under construction near <LOCATION> Cedar </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>. The agreement came a month after a shipment of the fuel oxidizer made by <ORGANIZATION> PEPCON </ORGANIZATION> was seized aboard a ship bound for <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION>, however, said the space agency had no information to suggest the company knew the shipment was headed to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. The loan actually is being provided by a bank, but <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> are, in essence, guaranteeing it by agreeing to purchase at least 20 million pounds of ammonium perchlorate a year for the next seven years. The government stepped forward to help secure the loan because the 1988 blast at the company's plant in <LOCATION> Henderson </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nev. </LOCATION>, left only one <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> supplier of the oxidizer used for the space shuttle and military rockets. Construction of the $ 73 million <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> plant has continued under interim financing, and the facility is expected to open in mid-May, said <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Keith </PERSON> <PERSON> Rooker </PERSON>, executive vice president of <ORGANIZATION> PEPCON </ORGANIZATION>'s parent, <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. A 286,000-pound shipment of the oxidizer was seized Feb. 25 in <LOCATION> Rotterdam </LOCATION> aboard a freighter bound for <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> The 1,144 30-gallon drums were enough to fuel 300 military missiles and were valued at about $ 350,000, officials said. The shipment had been owned by a West German company, D.A. <PERSON> Dampf </PERSON>, which obtained it from a <LOCATION> Swiss </LOCATION> company that had purchased it from <ORGANIZATION> Girindus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, officials said. <PERSON> Girindus </PERSON> made the initial purchase from <ORGANIZATION> PEPCON </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Rooker </PERSON> said his company had investigated Girindus before selling it the oxidizer and was satisified it was an `` honest and reputable'' buyer. `` We never had any reason to know or suspect however remotely that any material we manufactured or sold was going to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Rooker </PERSON>. A federal judge in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> ruled Tuesday that <PERSON> Girindus </PERSON> must forfeit the shipment to the government. He said Customs agents had probable cause for the seizure.

 Authorities proclaimed a day of mourning today for two police officers killed in bloody clashes in <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION> province that left at least 21 people dead and 74 injured. A spokeswoman for <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION>'s information office, <PERSON> Marija </PERSON> <PERSON> Gasi </PERSON>, told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, `` Today the situation in <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION> is normal. There has been no single extraordinary event.'' However, <PERSON> Radmilo </PERSON> <PERSON> Bogdanovic </PERSON>, interior minister of the republic of <LOCATION> Serbia </LOCATION>, described the situation as `` dramatic and changing from hour to hour.'' `` The security forces are making great efforts to restore peace and order,'' <PERSON> Bogdanovic </PERSON> told <LOCATION> Serbia </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>. The protests in <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION>, which is part of the republic of <LOCATION> Serbia </LOCATION>, began last week after <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> approved constitutional changes giving <LOCATION> Serbia </LOCATION> control of the provincial police, courts and civil defense. <LOCATION> Serbia </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> approved the changes Tuesday. Ethnic Albanians, who make up 85 percent of <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION>'s 1.9 million citizens, say the changes threaten autonomy they won under the 1974 constitution. Protesters hurled stones at riot police, who responded with tear gas. Two policemen, one an ethnic <PERSON> Albanian </PERSON> and one a Serb, were shot and killed Monday. Officials said 19 protesters died Monday and Tuesday. Sources in <LOCATION> Pristina </LOCATION>, the capital of <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION>, said there were unconfirmed reports two more demonstrators died during the night following clashes in the village of Zur, near the border of <LOCATION> Albania </LOCATION>. Police in Zur shot to death an 18-year-old Tuesday, and the state-run <ORGANIZATION> Tanjug </ORGANIZATION> news agency reported 14 people injured in the village, which was sealed off by police. The entire province was placed under an 8 p.m. to 5 a.m. curfew Tuesday. <PERSON> Bogdanovic </PERSON> estimated that on Monday, the worst day of bloodshed and rioting, there were 14,000 mainly young ethnic Albanians on the streets of <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION>, battling 2,400 police. The <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> said 146 demonstrators were detained Monday and Tuesday. There were rumors that several prominent ethnic Albanians, including businessmen, government officials and university professors, were questioned by police in connection with the violence. They could not be confirmed. The deputy head of <LOCATION> Pristina </LOCATION>'s university, <PERSON> Muhamed </PERSON> <PERSON> Bicaj </PERSON>, said he heard of one philosophy professor being questioned by police Tuesday night. The man was allowed to go home afterward, <PERSON> Bicaj </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> Serbia </LOCATION> says the constitutional changes are needed to protect the province's Slav minority, which alleges harassment by ethnic Albanians. At least 30,000 Slavs are estimated to have left <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION> since the last ethnic riots erupted there in 1981. At least nine people died in the protests. The anniversary of those riots is Saturday. Officials hoped a heavy police presence in <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION>, in addition to tanks and other military vehicles, would prevent new protests. <ORGANIZATION> Tanjug </ORGANIZATION> said 76 people were injured in the latest unrest, two more than the figure released by the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>. According to the ministry, 25 policemen were injured _ five seriously _ and 49 demonstrators were hurt. It accused ethnic <PERSON> Albanian </PERSON> `` nationalists and separatists'' of fomenting unrest and sniping at police from buildings and rooftops. There have been frequent allegations since 1981, particularly in <LOCATION> Serbia </LOCATION>, that <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION>'s ethnic Albanians have an organized underground movement that wants to unite the province with <LOCATION> Albania </LOCATION>. Ethnic Albanians deny such intentions. In addition to the ethnic tension, <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION> has been hard hit by the country's economic crisis. It is the poorest region of <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>, where inflation is expected to hit 400 percent in April and unemployment is 15 percent. In <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION>, about 30 percent of the population is unemployed.

 An 82-year-old man accused of robbing a bank and making his getaway on a 10-speed bicycle may be the `` salt-and-pepper'' bandit wanted in nearly a dozen holdups in the last two years, police said. `` We have had involvement with those I consider to be the ` Over The Hill' gang, where the suspects may be in their 70s. But this may be the oldest one I've experienced,'' said <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Pence </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agent in charge in <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kelm </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Greeley </LOCATION>, was arrested Tuesday in a bank robbery in which a man in a stocking mask held employees at gunpoint and pedaled off on a stolen bicycle with an undetermined amount of cash, said Capt. <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Lauhon </PERSON>. A man whose children apparently had seen the holdup man take off a stocking mask followed him in his car and caught up with the suspect in a store, took a starter's pistol from him and held him for police, authorities said. Pence said <PERSON> Kelm </PERSON> also is a suspect in 10 robberies attributed to the elderly `` salt-and-pepper'' bandit `` due to the description of Mr. <PERSON> Kelm </PERSON>, ... due to the method and due to the locality and due to the style if you will.'' The bandit, who struck in <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Collins </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Loveland </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Greeley </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Longmont </LOCATION>, started in 1986 by robbing two cafeteries, then moved on to banks and supermarkets. Pence said <PERSON> Kelm </PERSON> may have escaped from a <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> chain gang about 40 years ago, and authorities are delving into old files to confirm that. <PERSON> Kelm </PERSON> was ordered held on federal bank robbery charges.

 <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> today ruled out the possibility of an amnesty for political prisoners, saying it did not think such a move was necessary. <PERSON> Wang </PERSON> <PERSON> Hanbin </PERSON>, vice chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, made the announcement shortly after seven human rights activists from <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> presented <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s legislature with a letter calling for the release of political prisoners. They specifically demanded the release of democracy advocate <PERSON> Wei </PERSON> <PERSON> Jingsheng </PERSON>, who was arrested 10 years ago today and sentenced to 15 years in prison for `` counterrevolutionary crimes.'' On Tuesday, Chinese customs officers held the <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> human rights activists at the Tanjin airport for three hours and seized a petition calling for an amnesty signed by 24,000 people outside <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. The activists say they are concerned about future Chinese treatment of <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, which returns to Chinese ownership in 1997. Since January, intellectuals in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> have written four open letters urging an amnesty and democratic change. So far, about 200 people have signed the petitions, which mark the 40th anniversary of the founding of Communist <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. One of the leaders of the <ORGANIZATION> Democracy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION> of 1978, <PERSON> Wei </PERSON> was jailed after he called for democratic change in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. `` We demand to meet with <PERSON> Wei </PERSON> <PERSON> Jingsheng </PERSON> and other political prisoners in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, anytime, anywhere,'' said <PERSON> Emily </PERSON> <PERSON> Lau </PERSON>, a journalist and a member of the <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> group. In his statement to reporters, Vice Chairman <PERSON> Wang </PERSON> acknowledged <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> has in the past released prisoners, such as war criminals and members of the old Kuomintang army, defeated by the Communists in 1949. `` That was given to those who had turned over a new leaf in life, and was in line with the country's specific conditions then,'' he said. Referring to the country's 40th anniversary, he said, `` the congress is not considering giving, nor does it think it necessary to offer, special pardons to prisoners on the occasion.'' The congress closes its annual session next week. <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>, a London-based human rights group, estimates thousands of Chinese prisoners have been jailed for their beliefs. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> maintains it has no political prisoners. Chinese customs agents seized the <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> petition on Tuesday when the human rights activists arrived in <LOCATION> Tanjin </LOCATION>, a city near <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> group, which returned home today, urged <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> to release its petition, which was signed mostly by Chinese from <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>. But people from 34 countries also signed the petition. A Chinese customs official said the seizure was made because the group was carrying `` an unreasonable amount of printed matter into <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>.'' He said he did n't know when the petitions would be returned. <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, a British colony since the 19th century, returns to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> in 1997. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> has guaranteed to keep its liberal economic and political system in place for 50 years but many <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> intellectuals are skeptical. The <LOCATION> Tianjin </LOCATION> incident marks one of the first times the question of human rights in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> has become intertwined with <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>'s future `` Without democracy in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, there can not be possibilities for democracy in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Lau </PERSON> <PERSON> Tinchi </PERSON>, a member of the <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> group. `` The 1997 question before us is tied with the question of whether democracy can be realized in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>.''

 Office buildings along one street of <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION>'s business district were evacuated for several hours today while soldiers defused a 500-pound <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> bomb, police said. The bomb was discovered in a parked car one week after a business organization told its members terrorists planned to target them to destabilize the province's economy. The bomb was defused safely and no one was injured, said a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ulster </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Constabulary </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>'s police force The device was found in <LOCATION> Upper </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Queen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Street </LOCATION> after the outlawed <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> telephoned a <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION> newspaper to say a bomb would go off in 15 minutes, said the police spokesman, speaking on condition of anonymity. Police would not say what type of explosive was in the bomb. They did say it was home made. The <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> is fighting to oust the British from the province and unite it with the mainly Roman Catholic Republic of <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>.

 A small homemade bomb exploded in front of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> consulate in <LOCATION> Sao </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paulo </LOCATION>, but caused no injuries or damage, the consulate and police said today. The bomb, which was placed at the entrance to the consulate garage, went off when a car ran over it Tuesday, <PERSON> Kathy </PERSON> <PERSON> Brion </PERSON>, the consulate's press spokeswoman, said.

The car, owned by a private company with offices in the consulate building, was not damaged by the bomb, according to a police officer who spoke on condition of anonymity.

<TEXT>
 No more sob stories, a city board ruled _ a developer must lop the top 12 floors off a <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> high-rise. The Board of Standards and Appeals on Tuesday unanimously denied a zoning variance to <ORGANIZATION> Parkview </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION>, which had offered to build about 40 low-income senior citizen apartments if it could leave the building intact. The builder has said it stands to lose $ 10 million by dismantling the fought-over floors. But the board ruled, `` There are no unique physical conditions peculiar to and inherent in the particular zoning lot which give rise to ... unnecessary hardship in complying with the provisions of the zoning resolution.'' <ORGANIZATION> Parkview </ORGANIZATION>, which erected the 31-story tower after city officials misread a zoning map that limited buildings to 19 floors, had gone all the way to the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> to avoid dismantling the 12 stories that were topped off in 1986. <LOCATION> Parkview </LOCATION> attorney <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Segal </PERSON> said he would meet with the developer in the next few days to decide whether to comply or appeal to state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. `` This is a very strong message: zoning is not for sale. No more indulging developers,'' said <PERSON> Genie </PERSON> <PERSON> Rice </PERSON>, president of a neighborhood group that led opposition to the building. `` You ca n't decide to go ahead with a project and then buy your way out. The fight began in 1986, when Ms. <PERSON> Rice </PERSON> discovered the building violated zoning laws. A state appeals court later ordered the upper floors removed, saying that <ORGANIZATION> Parkview </ORGANIZATION> must share the blame for not discovering the city's mistake. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> left that ruling intact last year. Dismantling of the extra floors would be the same process used to tear down old buildings; protective scaffolding is placed outside and workers pry off the brick facing, break the concrete floor into chunks and cut through metalwork.

 Police in <LOCATION> Alexandria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, were tracking down suspected drug dealers and abusers who live in public housing after the federal government granted an unprecedented exemption making it easier to evict them. `` The police are out on the street now arresting people and getting their addresses,'' Mayor <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Moran </PERSON> said Tuesday after being told that the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> had granted the District of <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> suburb an exemption from federal housing grievance regulations. <PERSON> Moran </PERSON> said the exemption, requested after the killing of a police officer and a drug-seeking gunman outside a housing project a week ago, was needed to eliminate time-consuming and costly regulations that discouraged local officials from pursuing evictions. Without the exemption, <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> regulations required local government officials to allow tenants threatened with evictions to appeal first to a federal administrative panel and then to the courts. `` Our review of the <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> statutes indicated a system of opportunities for two full trials ... a full range of due process guarantees,'' <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> general counsel-designate <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Keating </PERSON> said in explaining the agency's decision. Although the exemption is directed at <LOCATION> Alexandria </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Keating </PERSON> said `` the law is the same throughout the state -LRB- of <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> -RRB- and if other housing authorities had chronic drug activity'' they could expect to be exempted as well. However <PERSON> Keating </PERSON> said the exemption would be limited to evictions involving `` drug and drug-related activity.'' Last month, <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> sent a memo to the directors of the nation's 3,300 public housing authorities asking them to report on steps they were taking to combat the drug trade on their properties. <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> pledged `` to assist you and law-abiding residents in eliminating this plague from public housing.'' `` We're not going to take any chances on evicting anybody that might prove innocent,'' said <PERSON> Mayor </PERSON> <PERSON> Moran </PERSON>, explaining that the city would pursue evictions only in those cases where they have current evidence `` of criminal activity either committed by or condoned by the the public housing leaseholder.'' `` We're going to take advantage of it in both responsible and expeditious way to be a model for other housing authorities,'' he said. <PERSON> Moran </PERSON> said police had a list of 45 people in the city's public housing units who were targeted. The city sought the exemption at a meeting with <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> officials on Monday in the wake of a hostage-taking and fatal shootout at a public housing development in the <LOCATION> Old </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION> section. Last week <PERSON> Jamie </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Wise </PERSON>, 34, an escapee from a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, halfway house entered an apartment in the development, demanded crack cocaine and held five people hostage. Wise later released four of the hostages but emerged from the building with the fifth hostage at gunpoint. Wise was shot by a police sharpshooter and fatally wounded police Cpl. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hill </PERSON> before succumbing to his own wounds. Another officer was wounded. <PERSON> Moran </PERSON> said the city was granted the exemption after demonstrating to <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> officials that state law would insure tenants facing eviction would receive due process without the inclusion of some federal regulatory requirements. He said tenants would retain their rights to appeal evictions in federal and district court with the options of a trial by jury or civil discovery. `` There's a substantial protection already in the law,'' <PERSON> Moran </PERSON> said. But a lawyer who won an injunction in federal court last January against new <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> regulations that included granting exemptions to the grievance procedures disagreed. `` I think <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> does n't have the right to grant the waiver,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Bryson </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Berkeley </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION> `` There is a serious question whether their granting the waiver would be in contempt'' of the injunction, said <PERSON> Bryson </PERSON>. `` The injunction that the judge entered does not cover these specific issues. It had to do with -LRB- withholding -RRB- the publication of the new grievance procedures until a number of features were incorporated with tenant input,'' <PERSON> Keating </PERSON> countered. <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> Foscarinis </PERSON>, an attorney for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION> for the Homeless, an homeless advocacy group, said, `` The concern with drug activity in public housing is understandable but the response seems a little out of proportion.''

The gunmen surrendered less than three hours after seizing the Soviet-made Tupolev-154 owned by <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Malev </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> MTI </ORGANIZATION> said the hijackers demanded to be taken to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, but West German officials said the gunmen's motives were not known. The hijackers, who were armed with guns and carried a fake hand grenade, gave up at <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> when <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials prevented the plane from taxiing onto adjoining <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military base. A witness said a policeman collapsed during a shootout at <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> airport when the hijackers took a hostage and forced their way onto the aircraft. <PERSON> Hans </PERSON> <PERSON> Neitze </PERSON>, chief spokesman for <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> police, said: `` We found the emptied casing of a bullet, and we assume that there was at least one shot fired on the aircraft.'' He offered no further details. Criminal investigator <PERSON> Roland </PERSON> <PERSON> Desch </PERSON> said the hijackers initially demanded to be flown `` overseas'' but were convinced by the airliner's crew that the plane could not fly that far. The plane then went to <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION>. `` As far as I know, all passengers are safe. It ended without bloodshed,'' airport spokesman <PERSON> Hans </PERSON> <PERSON> Rainer </PERSON> <PERSON> Otto </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> police spokesman <PERSON> Karl-Heinz </PERSON> <PERSON> Wagner </PERSON> also said there were no injuries among those aboard the plane. <PERSON> Wagner </PERSON> said the youths were Czechoslovak citizens aged 15 and 16. `` We still do n't know what their motive was,'' <PERSON> Wagner </PERSON> said, adding the two youths were being questioned by police. He said the hijackers were armed with a sawed-off shotgun and a rifle and carried a fake grenade. <PERSON> Wolfgang </PERSON> <PERSON> Schwalm </PERSON>, a spokesman at <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> airport, said the hijackers gave up after officials refused to accept them at the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Rhein-Main </LOCATION> Base, which is located at the airport. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials confirmed that. `` The pair wanted to go to the American side of the airport,'' he told reporters. `` The Americans declined accepting them, and at that point the hijackers gave up.'' <PERSON> Desch </PERSON> said a military truck was driven onto the tarmac to prevent the jet from reaching the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> base. A <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, <PERSON> Eberhard </PERSON> <PERSON> Bock </PERSON>, said the jet was halted on the taxiway. `` Two men got off the plane and they were held by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military security police until the German police arrived and took over,'' <PERSON> Bock </PERSON> said. The jet had been en route to <LOCATION> Amsterdam </LOCATION>, said Hungarian radio, which was monitored in <LOCATION> Budapest </LOCATION>. It did not say where the flight originated. Witnesses at <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION>'s airport said two hijackers forced their way into the VIP lounge and took a female airport employee hostage. They then broke the glass wall of the airport building to get onto the tarmac where they aimed their guns at a policeman, said the witnesses, who spoke on condition of anonymity. There was shooting and the policeman collapsed, but it was not clear whether he had been shot, the witnesses said. The two men forced their way onto the plane but left their hostage behind, the witnesses said.

 An important radio telescope as wide as a football field collapsed because a 50-inch steel plate had weakened, said engineers investigating the loss of the nation's most precise astronomical instrument The 25-year-old telescope, which resembled a 300-foot-wide satellite dish, collapsed Nov. 15 as the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Astronomy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Observatory </ORGANIZATION> used it to map the universe. Until a replacement is built, mapping work will shift to a 140-foot-wide telescope at the observatory in <ORGANIZATION> Green </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Condon </PERSON> of the observatory's headquarters in <LOCATION> Charlottesville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION> `` It's an annoyance, but it's not fatal,'' he said. Officials hope to have the replacement built by 1993. A panel of engineers hired by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday the 600-ton dish collapsed because of a ripped steel plate. `` It's kind of like this: If you have a pyramid on three pillars and you crack one of the pillars, it's going to come at you,'' said <PERSON> Ludwig </PERSON> <PERSON> Oster </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> astronomy director. Scientists who inspected the structure annually failed to detect stress on the plate because the lattice support structure under the dish obscured the trouble spot, according to an engineers' report. The document did not blame anyone for failing to discover the problem. The foundation said it will cost $ 70 million to replace the telescope, but that the new one will be larger, sturdier and more flexible. The original telescope, which could be adjusted only on a north-south axis, cost $ 850,000.

 A black detainee escaped today and took refuge in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Consulate, officials said. Six other former detainees sought refuge in the <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> and demanded an end to restrictions on their activities. Police said <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> <PERSON> Ntombela </PERSON>, a teacher and anti-apartheid organizer who has been on a hunger strike, eluded six guards and escaped at daybreak from <LOCATION> Shifa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> in the port city of <LOCATION> Durban </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> Friedman </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, said late this afternoon that <PERSON> Ntombela </PERSON> had reached <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION>, 360 miles away, and was at the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Consulate. `` We have been in touch with the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> African </LOCATION> government with a view toward resolving this case as expeditiously as possible,'' said <PERSON> Friedman </PERSON>. He did not say how <PERSON> Ntombela </PERSON> reached the consulate. <PERSON> Ntombela </PERSON>, 27, was the eighth detainee to escape from a hospital since September. He fled as the government announced new steps to prevent such breakouts. Seven other detainees who escaped from hospitals since September quickly sought safety in foreign diplomatic missions. The government allowed all seven to remain free. Shortly before midday today, six black activists entered the British Embassy in <LOCATION> Pretoria </LOCATION> and said they would stay until the government lifted restrictions imposed on them following their release. The embassy issued a statement saying the six `` can not stay indefinitely on British government premises and should leave.'' `` We are nevertheless prepared to draw to the attention of the South African government once again to the issue of restrictions, but we do not believe that the visitors' case is being furthered by their continued stay in the embassy,'' the statement said. One of the six was <PERSON> Donsie </PERSON> <PERSON> Khumalo </PERSON>, a regional official of the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> African Trade Unions, the main black labor federation. He was released last week after staging a hunger strike to protest being held without charge. Like many other freed activists, <PERSON> Khumalo </PERSON>, 39, is barred from various political activities, required to report to a police station twice daily, and confined to his house at night. The other activists who entered the embassy compound were involved with anti-apartheid organizations in the <LOCATION> Pretoria </LOCATION> area. Colleagues of the six said their intention was to encourage <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> to pressure South African authorities to lift restrictions on all former detainees. Their move coincided with a visit by British Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> to neighboring <LOCATION> Zimbabwe </LOCATION>. She was expected to discuss the South African political situation with officials from <LOCATION> Zimbabwe </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION>. Brig. <PERSON> Leon </PERSON> <PERSON> Mellet </PERSON>, a spokesman for Law and Order Minister <PERSON> Adriaan </PERSON> <PERSON> Vlok </PERSON>, said <PERSON> Ntombela </PERSON>'s escape proved `` that stricter control will have to be placed on persons hospitalized and who are in custody. A central facility for this purpose will have to be made available.'' <PERSON> Mellet </PERSON> said detainees who go on hunger strikes in the future will be placed in Grootvlei Prison in <LOCATION> Bloemfontein </LOCATION> and, if they require hospital treatment, will be sent to <LOCATION> Pelomini </LOCATION> provincial hospital outside the city. <LOCATION> Bloemfontein </LOCATION> is a relatively remote provincial capital in central <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, where detainees would have more difficulty escaping and where publicity about the hunger strike campaign might be reduced. An estimated 600 detainees have gone on hunger strikes since January to protest being held without charge. The government says most detainees have been freed since the fasts began, but human rights activists say several hundred remain in detention. The detainees are held under a state of emergency declared almost three years ago to quell anti-apartheid unrest in black townships. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s system of apartheid establishes a racially segregated society in which the 28 million blacks have no vote in national affairs while the 5 million whites control the economy, schools and health services. <PERSON> Ntombela </PERSON>'s lawyer, <PERSON> Dahya </PERSON> <PERSON> Pillay </PERSON>, said <PERSON> Ntombela </PERSON> was detained in <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION> Sept. 2 and was admitted to hospital in early March for treatment of depression. Ms. <PERSON> Pillay </PERSON> said he began a hunger strike March 13.

<HEAD>Court Improperly Barred Oklahoma Taxes on Off-Reservation Businesses</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A federal court improperly barred <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> officials from taxing bingo games and cigarette sales at a motel run by the <LOCATION> Chickasaw </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Indian </LOCATION> tribe outside its reservation, the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruled today. In an unsigned opinion, the court sent the case back to state courts in <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> to decide the dispute. The fact that the tribe may have grounds under federal law to claim immunity from the taxes does not give the federal courts initial authority to rule in the dispute, the high court said. The justices overturned a ruling by the 10th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> that barred <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> from imposing the taxes. But today's ruling does not decide whether, in fact, <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> may impose the taxes. The motel run by the <ORGANIZATION> Chickasaws </ORGANIZATION> is located within the city limits of Sulphur, <LOCATION> Okla. </LOCATION>, and was purchased by the tribe from the federal <ORGANIZATION> Small </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> in 1972. The federal government retains title to the land on which the motel sits, holding it in trust for the tribe. <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> officials said an Indian tribe should not have complete immunity from state laws in areas off the reservation. The 10th Circuit court ruled against the state in June 1987, saying tribal sovereign immunity bars such suits against Indian tribes unless <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> specifically authorizes them. The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in December 1987 temporarily set aside the ruling and ordered further study by the appeals court in light of the justices' 1987 ruling in a <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> case that restricted the transfer of state court suits to federal courts. The justices in the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> case barred a federal court from presiding over a suit by workers who said they were fired illegally. The 10th Circuit court, after restudying the <LOCATION> Chickasaw </LOCATION> case, again ruled in favor of the tribe last year. In today's ruling, the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> said the 10th Circuit court ruling is `` plainly inconsistent'' with the justices' decision in the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> case. There were no recorded dissents. The case is <ORGANIZATION> Oklahoma </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tax </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> vs. <PERSON> Graham </PERSON>, 88-266.

 Motorists who lobbed everything from cherry bombs to bras into bridge toll baskets to protest higher taxes and tolls can just drive on through starting Sept. 1. All road and bridge tolls in <LOCATION> Jacksonville </LOCATION> will be lifted as a result of a new half-cent sales tax that went into effect Jan. 1, the <ORGANIZATION> Jacksonville </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday. Until the toll plazas are torn down, motorists will be directed to drive through without stopping. A year ago, citizens voted to replace the city's bridge and road tolls with a sales tax. But the tolls continued after the tax went into effect. Before the tolls are removed, transportation officials must refinance state bridge bonds using sales tax revenue instead of toll collections.

 Rain today cooled a warm spell from <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> after causing flash flooding that swamped cars in eastern <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. Despite widespread showers and thunderstorms, high temperatures today were forecast to be 10 to 20 degrees warmer than normal from southern <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> across the <LOCATION> Carolinas </LOCATION> and into <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>. But not for long. <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, whose 81-degree high on Tuesday broke a 1946 record by 4 degrees and inspired many to take their lunches out to parks or head for the banks of the <LOCATION> Charles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, was expected to reach only 40 degree by Thursday.

<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 After years of controversy and public debate, a renovated and sparkling <LOCATION> Louvre </LOCATION> museum opened today, crowned by a tall glass pyramid at its new entrance. After President <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> cut the ribbon at the inauguration ceremony and toured the collection, hundreds of people crowded in for a look. `` It's light, it's beautiful, it's superb,'' said <PERSON> Martine </PERSON> <PERSON> Bieri-Duminy </PERSON>, who lives nearby and watched the pyramid, designed by American architect I.M. <PERSON> Pei </PERSON>, being built. `` In the beginning, people in the neighborhood were against it. They thought the pyramid would spoil the architecture,'' she said. The dark, dingy Louvre most tourists remember is now a thing of the past. In its place is what is called the `` Grand Louvre,'' a splendid ultramodern and high-tech facility. The six-year, $ 850 million overhaul is the first part of a vast project to turn the <LOCATION> Louvre </LOCATION>, once a medieval fortress and then a royal palace, into the world's largest museum _ a distinction now held by the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Museum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Natural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> History </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. The Louvre project will be completed when the museum's northern wings, occupied by the <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> for the past 100 years, open to the public in 1993. The Grand Louvre is a unique blend of grandeur, history and convenience. Visitors who once wandered looking for the museum's entrance ca n't miss the new one _ a 70-foot, transparent pyramid soaring out between the <LOCATION> Louvre </LOCATION>'s main wings and flanked by three small pyramids and fountains. At the ground-level entrance are escalators and a graceful spiral staircase leading down to a vast, light-drenched lobby featuring ticket windows, the museum bookstore, boutiques, restaurants and a 400-seat auditorium. The lobby itself can handle 6,000 people time without crowding. Escalators leading to other parts of the museum branch out from the lobby, like spokes in a wheel, and shorten the routes to works like the <PERSON> Mona </PERSON> <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> and Winged Victory. The baroque architecture of the Louvre built under <PERSON> Napoleon </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> looms large against the ever-changing <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> skyscape. `` I used to pray for sun,'' <PERSON> Pei </PERSON> said in an interview. `` Afterward, I realized that the pyramid is even more transparent on a gray day when it takes on the moodiness of the <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> sky.'' A visit to the Louvre is a trip back in time. Visitors now have direct access to the vestiges of the medieval castle built by King <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Philippe </PERSON> in 1200 to protect <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> from invaders from <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>. Also on show is a history of the Louvre documented by thousands of artifacts dug up in the <PERSON> Napoleon </PERSON> courtyard. They bring to life the daily routines of Parisians from the 15th to the 19th centuries. With about 650,000 square feet of additional floor space, hundreds of paintings will have been dusted off and displayed for the first time. On view for the first time since 1963 are four mammoth murals by <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Le </PERSON> <PERSON> Brun </PERSON> -LRB- 1619-1690 -RRB- titled `` L'Histoire d'Alexandre.'' When the Grand Louvre is completed in 1993, it will house about 4,000 items, nearly double what it displays today. <PERSON> Pei </PERSON>'s pyramid, in specially manufactured slightly tinted glass, was the most controversial aspect of the renovation. `` Five years ago, I had my doubts,'' <PERSON> Pei </PERSON> said. `` Not many people would have bet on this project.'' Backed strongly by <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON>, who initiated the project, <PERSON> Pei </PERSON> perservered. The public was won over when a full-size model was erected on the spot. `` All through the centuries, the <LOCATION> Louvre </LOCATION> has undergone violent changes,'' <PERSON> Pei </PERSON> said. `` The time had to be right. I was confident because this is the right time.''

 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> today barred states from denying unemployment benefits to people who refuse to work on their Sabbath even if the refusal is not based on a religious sect's doctrine The justices, in a unanimous 9-0 decision, said <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> officials violated a <LOCATION> Peoria </LOCATION> man's religious freedom by denying him unemployment benefits. The high court previously had barred states from denying unemployment benefits to people who refuse certain work because of religious scruples. But in all previous cases, the workers' refusal was based on the teachings of an established religious group such as the Seventh-day Adventists or the <PERSON> Jehovah </PERSON>'s Witnesses. Justice <PERSON> Byron </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON> wrote for the court, `` Never did we suggest that unless a claimant belongs to a sect that forbids what his job requires, his belief, however sincere, must be deemed a purely personal preference rather than a religious belief.'' The ruling means, for example, that a Methodist or Roman Catholic might be eligible for unemployment benefits after refusing to work on Sunday even though neither church bars Sunday work as part of its official doctrine. In another ruling, the court overturned a federal appeals court ruling barring <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> from taxing bingo games and cigarette sales at a motel run by the <LOCATION> Chickasaw </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Indian </LOCATION> tribe outside its reservation. The justices' unsigned opinion sent the case back to <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION>'s state courts for a decision. In the case dealing with work on the Sabbath, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Frazee </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Peoria </LOCATION> was disqualified from receiving unemployment benefits after turning down in 1984 a temporary job assignment that would have required him to work on Sunday. <PERSON> Frazee </PERSON> said his understanding of the requirements and tenets of Christianity is that non-emergency work on Sundays is forbidden. The <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Employment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> ruled that <PERSON> Frazee </PERSON>'s rejection of the job offer disqualified him from receiving unemployment benefits. State officials, while not questioning <PERSON> Frazee </PERSON>'s sincerity, said a refusal to work due to religious scruples must be based `` on some tenet or dogma accepted by the individual of some church, sect or denomination'' _ and not based merely on personal religious convictions. <PERSON> Frazee </PERSON> sued, and <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> courts ruled against him. But the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> today said the state courts were wrong. White rejected arguments by state officials that a victory for <PERSON> Frazee </PERSON> would lead to Americans seeking Sundays off because they want to shop, play sports or even watch football on television. `` We are unpersuaded that there will be a mass movement away from Sunday employ if <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Frazee </PERSON> succeeds in his claim,'' <PERSON> White </PERSON> said. `` There may exist state interests sufficiently compelling to override a legitimate claim to the free exercise of religion,'' he added. `` No such interest has been presented here.'' The case dealing with <PERSON> Sabbath </PERSON> work is <PERSON> Frazee </PERSON> vs. <ORGANIZATION> Employment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, 87-1945. The <LOCATION> Chickasaw </LOCATION> case is <ORGANIZATION> Oklahoma </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tax </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> vs. <PERSON> Graham </PERSON>, 88-266.

 A man accused of killing a detective during a drug raid can not be tried because police lied to obtain the search warrant, a judge ruled today. Superior Court Judge <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Grabau </PERSON> dismissed the murder charge against <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewin </PERSON>, ending a case that has raised question about whether police routinely lie in obtaining warrants. `` A fair trial is not possible,'' the judge told a jammed courtroom. `` The conduct was egregious ... and the evidence is tainted.'' <PERSON> Lewin </PERSON>, 33, was charged in the slaying of Detective <PERSON> Sherman </PERSON> <PERSON> Griffiths </PERSON> during a raid Feb. 17, 1988. <PERSON> Griffiths </PERSON>, 36, was trying to break into an apartment when he was hit by a bullet fired through the door. Police later admitted that they had obtained the search warrant on the word of an informant who did n't exist. <PERSON> Lewin </PERSON> did not match the warrant's description of the cocaine dealer police said occupied the apartment. Detectives <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Luna </PERSON>, 32, <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON> <PERSON> Amate </PERSON>, 31, and <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Schroeder </PERSON>, 33, have been suspended while under investigation for possible perjury. The court had no choice but to dismiss the case, said <PERSON> Max </PERSON> <PERSON> Stern </PERSON>, <PERSON> Lewin </PERSON>'s attorney. `` It was not a lie it was hundreds of lies,'' he said. `` And in an effort to reinstate the case, it was just more lies.'' But prosecutors had argued that because there was strong evidence against <PERSON> Lewin </PERSON> and because police had admitted their misconduct, the case should be tried. <PERSON> Grabau </PERSON> ordered <PERSON> Lewin </PERSON> held for 24 hours while prosecutors decide whether to appeal his decision.

The institute's report offers only one hope: a growing awareness of the environmental hazards at hand. So let's think about the effects of spraying that aerosol can, of using plastic over recyclable paper products, of letting companies discharge their waste into the ocean, of running the water unnecessarily, of driving alone instead of using mass transportation, of paving over all the farmland, of wasting good food. Until we start to change our wasteful ways, the world will remain on its grim path.

How could it become one way that the average person can save Earth from overheating? ... <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> has launched a campaign to encourage the city and its citizens to plant from two million to five million trees in the next five years. The trees would cool sidewalks and buildings, provide attractive screening of freeways and concrete buildings, and _ most of all _ absorb carbon dioxide that is believed to be the major cause of an impending worldwide warming trend. ... Since Los Angeles turns out more carbon dioxide, as well as many other harmful chemicals, than just about any other city in the world, it is a good place to start a campaign to plant trees. Trees, like other vegetation, consume carbon dioxide as fuel and give off oxygen as a byproduct. ... Last week the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> threw its weight behind tree-planting. ... The agency recommended stopping the net global deforestation by planting at least as many trees as are felled.

 March 25 The Journal, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ulm </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minn. </LOCATION>, on the minimum wage proposals: The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Representatives </ORGANIZATION> is on a collision course with <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> over the issue of minimum wage. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> passed a bill ... that sets the minimum wage at $ 4.55 per hour, 30 cents higher than <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s proposal. The bill does include a subminimum wage provision for first-time workers, a provision that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also supports. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has vowed to veto the bill, and it appears the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> does not now have the votes to override his veto. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> version of the bill calls for raising the minimum wage to $ 4.65 per hour and does n't include a subminimum wage, though that could be included as a compromise. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> should take care in adjusting the minimum wage. There is a danger, economists agree, that hiking the wage will result in fewer jobs, especially for people just starting out in the job market.

Instead, he has reason for concern.

Nevertheless, the results of many real contests must alarm the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION>.

In <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> and other cities, a handful of radicals who favor a multi-party system, anathema to <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, were elected.

 Democrat <PERSON> Jill </PERSON> <PERSON> Long </PERSON>, the upset winner in a special election for the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> seat once held by <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, received a congratulatory call today from the vice president. `` He wished me well and congratulated me and offered to assist in any way because he's committed to the Fourth District,'' said Long, whose victory after two previous failed campaigns ended a 13-year Republican hold on the district. Long, 36, a business professor, received 65,160 votes or 51 percent to 63,388 votes or 49 percent for Republican <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Heath </PERSON>. Republican party chairman <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> he was `` ashamed'' the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> had lost. `` I have no excuses. We should have won that race. I am very surprised we lost it,'' he said. <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> paid the winner a backhanded compliment when he said she `` ran a campaign I would have been proud of'' that included plenty of attacks against <PERSON> Heath </PERSON>. The victory was the Democrats' first in the <LOCATION> northeast </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> district since 1974 and ended a string of seven <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> victories, some marked by 2-1 margins, that <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> began in 1976. Long told <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> she had learned valuable lessons in her <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> campaign against him in 1986. At her first news conference as representative-elect today, <PERSON> Long </PERSON> said she did n't regard the election as a test of strength between national Republicans and Democrats, despite the help from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> for both campaigns. `` This was just a race between two individuals in <LOCATION> northeast </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>,'' she said. `` It's a hard pill to swallow, but I am a man, and a good man, and I did my best,'' said <PERSON> Heath </PERSON>, who claimed <PERSON> Long </PERSON> had distorted his record with negative advertising painting him as a privileged lawyer and a bureaucrat. The Democrats seized an unexpected opportunity presented when incumbent <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Coats </PERSON> resigned in January to take the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> seat vacated when <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> became vice president. Running a familiar candidate against a relative unknown, Democrats poured at least $ 250,000 into the campaign in less than two months and former Democratic presidential hopeful Sen. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> stumped for Long. <PERSON> Heath </PERSON>, 36, received as much support from Republicans but was tied to the unpopular administration of Mayor <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Helmke </PERSON>, whom he served as safety director. <PERSON> Heath </PERSON> lost despite campaign visits by <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and Agriculture Secretary <PERSON> Clayton </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON>. Long lost the November general election by nearly 50,000 votes to Coats, a former <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> aide to <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> who took over the seat when <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> mounted his first successful <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> race in 1980. Two years earlier, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> drubbed <PERSON> Long </PERSON> to win his second <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> term. Long ran those races with minimal funding and was criticized by some party regulars for not campaigning aggressively, but she said the experience paved the way for Tuesday's victory. `` I think I had generated or built a lot of support in 1986 and again last year in two very tough races,'' she said. `` I think by holding news conferences and traveling throughout the district, I was able to get my message out. `` And that is that I will be an independent voice for northeast <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> and my country.'' <PERSON> Long </PERSON> said she expected to be sworn in Monday, giving <ORGANIZATION> Indiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> a 7-3 advantage in the state's delegation in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. Campaign officials in both parties had predicted a light voter turnout with estimates ranging as low as 25 to 30 percent, but nearly half the district's 267,000 registered voters cast ballots.

 Authorities cut off food, water and power at a prison farm today where armed inmates were holed up for a fourth day with hundreds of people who were visiting when the prisoners revolted. `` It's the only way we can pressure them,'' <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramos </PERSON> <PERSON> Moncada </PERSON>, inspector general of prisons, said of the mutinous inmates. `` If we do n't they could stay inside for days or weeks,'' he told reporters as he entered the prison. He said supplies and power was cut off before dawn to the area of the prison controlled by scores of rebellious inmates. Witnesses said Tuesday that as many as 100 inmates and about 600 visitors had depleted food stocked in the area under their control. Authorities are unsure whether visitors still inside are hostages or are there to support and protect the rebels. Negotiations with the prisoners, who took over the <PERSON> Pavon </PERSON> prison farm on Easter Sunday, came to a standstill Tuesday. The inmates were told to lay down their arms and let the civilians leave or face the cutoff of food, water and power. `` We're at an impasse,'' the Rev. <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>, chaplain of Guatemalan prisons said late Tuesday. <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON> is part of the delegation negotiating with the inmates at the facility outside <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. The bodies of four guards and three inmates who were killed in Sunday's takeover have been recovered, authorities said. Five others are believed dead, said prison spokesman <PERSON> Conrado </PERSON> <PERSON> Monroy </PERSON>, but their bodies have not been found on the grounds of the 2 -LCB- - square-mile prison, <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION>'s largest About 20 inmates not among the rebels were transported to another prison on Tuesday. They were seen leaving the prison, handcuffed by twos. Another half dozen visitors who had been inside since Sunday also made their way out. Most of the prison's 1,350 inmates were not involved in the rebellion, officials said. The facility is designed to house 800 people. The prison seizure resulted from a frustrated escape attempt, authorities said, when inmates commandeered about 75 M-1 rifles and ammunition from the prison arsenal. About 1,000 army and police troopers were stationed around the facility. But President <PERSON> Vinicio </PERSON> <PERSON> Cerezo </PERSON> has said force will not be used unless the inmates try to shoot their way out. The rebels have demanded amnesty for crimes committed since Sunday, reduced sentences, better food and treatment and removal of the facility's current authorities. The main sticking point in negotiations appears to be the government's inability or unwillingness to guarantee amnesty for crimes committed during the rebellion. The government has offered not to harm inmates involved in the uprising and says it will intercede on their behalf before the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, the only authority constitutionally empowered to award pardons. Most of the rebels were serving terms of up to 30 years for murder, kidnapping and other felonies.

 A man with a large knife today slashed 10 17th century Dutch paintings, including several by pupils of <PERSON> Rembrandt </PERSON>, a museum official said. `` It is an enormous disaster,'' spokesman <PERSON> Willem </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Paus </PERSON> said of the incident at the Dordrechts Museum in this western city. The attacker, a 61-year-old unemployed man who was not identified in line with Dutch judicial practice, was being held by police in nearby Papendrecht. Works by <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuyp </PERSON>, <PERSON> Nicolaas </PERSON> <PERSON> Maes </PERSON>, <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> Bol </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jacobus </PERSON> <PERSON> Levecc </PERSON>, and Jan Victors were damaged in the attack. `` He was apparently very frustrated that he was out of work, and he wanted to vent his anger,'' <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Paus </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> in a telephone interview. Among the damaged paintings are a 1656 family group by <PERSON> Bol </PERSON>, a self-portrait from 1685 by <PERSON> Maes </PERSON>, and a conversion of Saulus done by <LOCATION> Cuyp </LOCATION> in 1650, according to <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Paus </PERSON>. The man entered the museum at about 1:45 p.m., said <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Paus </PERSON>. He inflicted `` very bad damage'' to 10 paintings on display in three rooms before being spotted by a guard via a closed television circuit, the spokesman said. Two guards tried to overpower the man, but he escaped by threatening them with the knife, according to <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Paus </PERSON>. He surrendered later. `` They're really very heavily damaged. From some of them he cut whole chunks, and others have large diagonal slashes,'' <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Paus </PERSON> said, adding that it was `` too early'' to establish whether the paintings were beyond repair. He estimated the value of the paintings at `` many millions of guilders -LRB- dollars -RRB-.'' In December, three paintings by <PERSON> Vincent </PERSON> <PERSON> van </PERSON> <PERSON> Gogh </PERSON> were stolen from the <LOCATION> Kroeller-Mueller </LOCATION> museum in the eastern <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION>. The works were not recovered.

The incidents have raised grave doubts about security in Dutch museums, where a government austerity drive has resulted in a decrease in museum staffing.

 The nation's first licensed, private spaceship blasted off into the morning sky today on a suborbital flight lasting 15 minutes. The Consort 1 payload of scientific experiments went through more than seven minutes of near weightlessness after the 8:42 a.m. launch. The craft climbed 198 miles above <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> and landed about 50 miles north of the launch pad. `` We've been working a long time to put up a successful launch,'' said a jubilant <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Vance </PERSON>, vice president of finance and administration for <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, which launched the commercial rocket. `` It's the first of many, and we think its a real breakthrough.'' Spectators cheered as the slender, white rocket shot into the cloudless sky, leaving a white vapor trail. The 100 people who gathered 1 -LCB- miles from the launch pad did n't hear the rocket's whoosh until it dropped its first stage, six seconds and more than a mile into the flight The rocket disappeared from view in 25 seconds. The voyage was a small step by the standards of previous space travel but a giant leap for the fledgling private spacecraft industry, observers inside and outside the government believe. In the 1990s, private companies are expected to begin putting satellites into orbit as the federal government gets out of the business. The federal government began to realize the potential of the private space industry after the successful September 1982 launch of the Conestoga 1 rocket with a dummy payload from <LOCATION> Matagorda </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, officials said. But <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, the Houston-based company responsible for both the Conestoga and Consort rockets, had to deal with 18 federal agencies in its quest to fire Conestoga 1 because there was no precedent for the flight. That prompted the federal government to assign the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> the task of licensing private launches and helping cut red tape. The Consort 1 is the first commercial ship licensed by the department. The government felt more pressure to foster private launches after the disaster of the space shuttle Challenger in January 1986, said <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Whitten </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>'s office for commercial programs. The <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> expects to process 10 launch licenses this year, said <PERSON> Carol </PERSON> <PERSON> Lane </PERSON>, director of the agency's commercial space transportation department Five companies are offering launch services and <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> are considering offering private spaceports, she said. Space Services sees suborbital flights like the Consort 1 as only a beginning and plans orbital flights in the future, spokesman <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Daniels </PERSON> said. `` The orbital business is where we'll make the big bucks,'' he said. Consort 1 is estimated to cost $ 1 million to $ 2 million. <PERSON> Daniels </PERSON> said he expects to see Space Services generate annual revenues of $ 100 million to $ 500 million once it starts sending satellites into orbit in the next decade. The Consort 1's 650-pound payload was assembled by the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alabama-Huntsville </ORGANIZATION>'s Consortium for Materials Development in Space, one of 16 commercial development consortiums sponsored by <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION>. It includes experiments designed to measure how liquids mix in weightlessness, how plastic foam forms and cures, how liquids coat glass surfaces, how epoxy reacts in weightlessness and how finely powdered metals bond under high temperature to produce alloys. The experiments have applications in medicine, the manufacture of metal alloys and in construction of space stations. Consort 1 was boosted into space by a modified <ORGANIZATION> Terrier </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> rocket; the second stage is a Black Brant rocket. The entire vehicle stands about 52 feet and weighs 6,000 pounds at liftoff.

<TEXT>
 Former Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> acknowledged today that after twice urging <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON> to tell the truth, <PERSON> North </PERSON> withheld critical details about the diversion of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> arms sale money to the Contra rebels in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. Testifying at <LOCATION> North </LOCATION>'s trial on 12 felony charges, <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> was asked by prosecutor <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Keker </PERSON> whether the White House national security aide had mentioned the involvement of arms dealers <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Secord </PERSON> or <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Hakim </PERSON> in the diversion. `` No sir,'' <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> replied when asked about <PERSON> Secord </PERSON>, then <PERSON> Hakim </PERSON>. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> also acknowledged that <PERSON> North </PERSON> had n't mentioned the role of Swiss-based attorney <PERSON> Willard </PERSON> <PERSON> Zucker </PERSON>, who worked for <PERSON> Hakim </PERSON> and <PERSON> Secord </PERSON>. The ex-attorney general also said <PERSON> North </PERSON> had n't mentioned how the price of the arms sold to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> had been marked up by 270 percent, with some of the excess going to the Contras. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> said he told North he should n't conceal anything both at the beginning of the interview and just before disclosing that he knew of the diversion plan from a memo North prepared. <PERSON> Keker </PERSON>'s questioning followed testimony Tuesday in which <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> agreed with defense attorney <PERSON> Brendan </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> that the Nov. 23, 1986 interview was more like a `` chat'' between `` co-workers.'' Today, <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> in his closing question to the former attorney general made the point that <PERSON> North </PERSON> had told the truth on the central point of the interview by telling <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> that the diversion had occurred. North is charged with falsely telling <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> that the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> had no involvement with the diversion and that <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> determined the amount of money funneled to the Contras. In fact, <PERSON> North </PERSON> and other <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials were directing the secret operation. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> testified Tuesday that his interview with <PERSON> North </PERSON> was part of an `` administrative inquiry,'' not a criminal investigation. Under questioning by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Gerhard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON>, <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> said <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s obligation to answer questions was as a `` loyal member of the administration'' and that he was under `` no legal compulsion'' to do so. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> agreed with <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> that the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration was worried that the political fallout from the diversion could cause `` the toppling of the president himself.'' <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s discovery of the diversion came during a weekend inquiry he conducted for <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. Earlier disclosure of the administration's secret weapons sales to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> had already produced an uproar <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>, who informed President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> of the diversion on Nov. 24, 1986, said he did n't know if the word `` impeachment'' itself was used in discussions, but that there was anxiety over `` the tremendous consequences.'' <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> said he was concerned that administration opponents might get hold of the information and make it public, so he urged quick action to limit the political damage. He held a news conference the next day to announce the news. `` I felt it vital that there not be any appearance of a coverup,'' said the former attorney general. North was fired and his boss, national security adviser <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON>, resigned. Also, the Tower commission was created and independent counsel <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> was appointed in December 1986. `` They were the actions taken because they were the appropriate actions to take in any event,'' said <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>. `` But one of the concerns was from preventing this from being used by political opponents of the president.'' <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> described interviewing <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> on Nov. 23, 1986, a Sunday, seeking confirmation of a memo found the previous day at <LOCATION> North </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> office The memo by <PERSON> North </PERSON> outlined a plan for the diversion. The <ORGANIZATION> NSC </ORGANIZATION> aide told <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> the diversion had already occurred from an earlier arms shipment to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. `` Your worst nightmare had come true?'' North lawyer <PERSON> Brendan </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> asked <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>. `` Yes,'' <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> replied. `` You knew that spelled trouble?'' asked <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>. `` Yes, I did,'' responded <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>.

 <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> has reversed course and will take $ 215,000 in severance pay from his previous job as a medical school president. <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> said in a statement released Tuesday evening by his office that the severance, which was part of his contract as president of the <ORGANIZATION> Morehouse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medicine </ORGANIZATION>, has been approved by the Office of Government Ethics. `` I have made this agreement in the full faith that it in no way presents ethical difficulty, or appearance of difficulty, with regard to my services as <ORGANIZATION> HHS </ORGANIZATION> secretary,'' he said. <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> had previously decided to forgo the money because he said he wanted to avoid even the appearance of potential conflicts of interest with his connection to the medical school, which receives federal grants. He said such questions could hamper his effectiveness and damage <ORGANIZATION> Morehouse </ORGANIZATION>'s image. Even though the Office of Government Ethics had informally approved the severance pay as money earned before he came to the federal government, <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> said he was concerned by news reports at the time that raised conflict questions about his connection to <ORGANIZATION> Morehouse </ORGANIZATION>. But his sacrifice raised concerns on Capitol Hill. Members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> said that while his decision was admirable, they were concerned it could set a precedent and discourage others from taking government jobs. Indeed, <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>'s announcement came one day after a <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> editorial also bade him to reconsider and take the money, saying `` unjust sacrifice can weaken standards as much as lax enforcement.'' At the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, press secretary <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said today that President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was pleased by the decision. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> committee which reviewed <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>'s nomination `` felt he was entitled to some money so there was no question'' in terms of an ethical problem. When <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> decided to forfeit the money, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was on the defensive about ethics issues, with questions being raised about then Defense Secretary-designate <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tower </PERSON>'s relationships with defense contractors, <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> ethics chief <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Boyden </PERSON> <PERSON> Gray </PERSON>'s links to a communications corporation, Housing and Urban Development Secretary <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>'s acceptance of speaking fees exceeding <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> limits, and <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Clayton </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON>'s acceptance of a lavish reception from a tobacco The secretary, the highest-ranking black in the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration, said in an interview earlier this month that he would `` readily reverse'' his decision because `` I'm not a wealthy man.'' <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> saw his annual pay drop from $ 172,000 last year to $ 89,500 in his new job. He had said, however, that he would wait until the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> completed its review of the matter. Though the committee has not formally acted, the panel's staff drafted a letter encouraging <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to `` see to it that Dr. <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> reconsiders his decision'' because `` we think others will be influenced by what he has done,'' said a committee source who spoke on the condition of anonymity. With <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>'s reversal, the wording of the letter _ to be signed by Sen. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, committee chairman, and Sen. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Packwood </PERSON>, R-Ore., ranking member _ would probably be changed to support the secretary's change of heart, the source said <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> earlier had said the severance clause in his contract entitled him to $ 297,000. <ORGANIZATION> HHS </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON> <PERSON> Gardett </PERSON> said the $ 215,000 agreed to by <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> and the medical school `` was an amount he felt was fair for him and <ORGANIZATION> Morehouse </ORGANIZATION>.'' <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> is taking an unpaid leave of absence as a professor of medicine at the medical school, which he founded. Earlier, he had asked the White House for permission to take a paid sabbatical from the school, but the request was denied because <ORGANIZATION> Morehouse </ORGANIZATION>'s sabbatical policy did not meet the federal government's standards The White House was concerned the school did not apply its sabbatical policy uniformly, which could make it appear that the school, while receiving federal money, was illegally subsidizing the pay of a federal official.

<HEAD>Move Over, Goodyear Blimp: Soviets Selling Ads on its Rockets</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BERN, Switzerland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Companies tired of using blimps and billboards for their advertising might want to hitch their products to a star _ a red star. The Swiss advertising agency <ORGANIZATION> Punto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> S.A. </ORGANIZATION> has signed a deal with the Soviets to find Western firms who want to plug their products via the Sovet space program. <PERSON> Andrea </PERSON> <PERSON> Capra </PERSON> said Tuesday he signed a contract with Soviet authorities in October to sell advertising space on their spaceships, launch pads and cosmonaut uniforms. An official at the Soviet trade mission in <LOCATION> Bern </LOCATION> confirmed that the Soviets were working with the Bienne-based firm. `` There were negotiations last year which ended in success,'' said the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> official, who asked not to be identified. The main exposure would be on the ground at space launches, which the Soviets have indicated they want to open increasingly to Western TV crews, <PERSON> Capra </PERSON> said. The footage could be shown on TV as part of international news coverage or used later for publicity purposes, he added. Advertising would likely be painted on rocket sections, which fall into the sea after launching, he said. But under the accord, cosmonauts also could wear publicity stickers on their in-flight suits `` like Formula One'' racers. A prime `` billboard'' would be the Mir manned space station, which has space for two company or product logos, <PERSON> Capra </PERSON> said. `` We're in concrete negotiations with three multinationals,'' <PERSON> Capra </PERSON> said. He declined to identify the companies. The first Soviet space shot with advertising could take place as early as this fall, he said. He said he launched the idea `` because it simply seemed more original than advertising on <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> space shuttles.''

<TEXT>
 The wife of one of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s most famous jailed dissidents has not been allowed to see him for more than three years and says he has been forced to sleep on bricks in a mosquito-infested cell. <PERSON> Kang </PERSON> <PERSON> Tong </PERSON> said the last time she visited <PERSON> Xu </PERSON> <PERSON> Wenli </PERSON>, his teeth were falling out, his hair had turned white and the skin hung loose on his face. <PERSON> Xu </PERSON> is 46. She keeps a crumpled piece of paper in her coat pocket with the date she last saw her husband: Oct. 10, 1985. Her daughter, <PERSON> Xu </PERSON> <PERSON> Jin </PERSON>, a 16-year-old with a pony tail and pink cheeks, does n't need the reminder; she knows the date by heart. Despite regulations guaranteeing inmates one visit a month, no relatives have seen Xu since 1985. Still, from the six or seven letters that are allowed to be sent every year, they know he's alive `` We both just want him home,'' <PERSON> Kang </PERSON> said in an interview this week. `` Our family needs a husband's help and a father's love.'' An electrician by profession, <PERSON> Xu </PERSON> was jailed in 1981 and sentenced to 15 years for `` counterrevolutionary activities.'' His crimes included taking part in the <ORGANIZATION> Democracy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION> of 1978 during which he published an unsanctioned periodical calling for political change. In his mimeographed journal, April 5th Forum, <PERSON> Xu </PERSON> argued a multiparty system was not anti-Marxist and would help the socialist cause. The movement was tolerated by <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s new leader, <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaoping </PERSON>, until he consolidated his power. Then came the crackdown. Since January, more and more Chinese intellectuals have begun calling for the release of political prisoners such as <PERSON> Xu </PERSON> and <PERSON> Wei </PERSON> <PERSON> Jingsheng </PERSON>, who was arrested 10 years ago Wednesday for helping lead the democracy movement. The government says no release is planned and denies it holds political prisoners. <PERSON> Kang </PERSON> remembers well her October 1985 visit to the Beijing No. 1 Prison. Xu came to the window wearing his black prison overalls, No. 001 stitched to his shirt pocket. `` His hair was almost all white and his skin was loose on his face. His teeth were all rotting. It was pitiful to know that this man was once a free man,'' she said. Soon thereafter, an essay by <PERSON> Xu </PERSON> was smuggled out of prison. Titled `` My Self-Defense,'' <PERSON> Xu </PERSON> gave details of his arrest and prosecution. Without explanation, <PERSON> Kang </PERSON> was not allowed any more visits. `` I wrote to the jail, I went to the jail to plead to see my husband but they would n't let me,'' she said. `` They told me that I knew the reason.'' In May 1986, <PERSON> Kang </PERSON> needed to consult with her husband about an experimental operation planned for their daughter's left leg, but the prison refused. Miss Xu went herself to plead with the warden, but he turned her down. `` He said, ` Go ask your mother the reason why,''' said the girl, who has since undergone two operations and hopes to have her cast removed in May. After the essay was smuggled out, life became increasingly difficult for <PERSON> Xu </PERSON>, his wife said, citing his letters and reports from sympathetic friends with sources in the jail: Prison authorities moved him from an 86-square-foot room to a 43-square-foot cell. Guards took away his bed and forced him to sleep on bricks. Lights were kept on constantly. In the winter, he froze. In the summer, he was ravaged by mosquitoes because the prison refused to accept the netting his wife sent. Family packages are returned. `` Every Spring Festival holiday, I'd go to the jail and wait at the gate with a bundle for him,'' <PERSON> Kang </PERSON> said. `` ` No way, if that's for <PERSON> Xu </PERSON> <PERSON> Wenli </PERSON>,' the guards said. There have been small joys, however. Miss <PERSON> Xu </PERSON>'s school is just blocks from the jail, and when the wind was right he could hear the students singing. `` Today you had a singing competition at school,'' <PERSON> Xu </PERSON> wrote in one letter. `` I thought I heard your voice.'' `` The next time, I sang extra hard for him,'' Miss <PERSON> Xu </PERSON> said. But <PERSON> Kang </PERSON> soon took her daughter from the school because the sons and daughters of many of the prison guards taunted her. `` Even my teacher kept asking me if my papa had come home,'' Miss <PERSON> Xu </PERSON> said. `` One day, I told him ` yes' and he scolded me for lying.'' <PERSON> Kang </PERSON> said recent letters indicate <PERSON> Xu </PERSON>'s treatment has improved somewhat. He is using paper she sent him and acknowledges receipt of their letters. The prison also allowed him to write to his mother. `` He does n't know she died in 1987,'' <PERSON> Kang </PERSON> said. `` I wo n't tell him because I'm afraid it will hurt him so.'' <PERSON> Kang </PERSON>, a teacher in a business school, said she and her daughter were getting by OK on her monthly salary of around 100 yuan, about $ 27. `` The real problem is with our spirits,'' she said, `` always dreaming of something that never happens. It leaves us empty sometimes.'' <PERSON> Kang </PERSON> said her husband did nothing to deserve his punishment. `` All he did was talk,'' she said. `` It's such a brutal thing to do to a man, just for a few words.''

<HEAD>South Korean President Takes Tough Line Against Opponents</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP Extra</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 One year into his term, President <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> <PERSON> Tae-woo </PERSON> has started to take a tough line against opponents, calling off a referendum on his performance and cracking down on both dissidents and government hardliners. <PERSON> Roh </PERSON>, who has tried to follow moderate policies and portray himself as a populist, has not gained firm control of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s turbulent politics But the former general shows no sign of trying to backtrack on democratic reforms despite cracking down on the opposition he faces from the left and the right. While there are no signs that <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> could lose power, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s chronic political unrest is likely to continue as the nation struggles to adjust to a democratic system after decades of authoritarian rule. <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> said radical groups were plotting to stage a violent leftist revolution when he stunned the nation March 20 by indefinitely postponing a referendum on his performance. A referendum would lead to political chaos, he said. `` The people are worried. Leftist forces are trying to ... overthrow the free democratic system,'' <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> told the nation. He ordered police to suppress the often violent demonstrations staged by radical students, strikers, farmers and other groups. A government report said there were more than 7,000 protests in 1988. The government vowed further action after top dissident <PERSON> Moon </PERSON> <PERSON> Ik-hwan </PERSON> made a secret visit March 25 to communist <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> for talks on reuniting the two nations. Enraged officials said dissidents were trying to aid <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. Some political analysts said <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> called off the referendum because he feared he could not win, and a defeat probably would have forced the government to call new presidential elections. `` If <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> could have been sure of winning there is no reason he would not have gone ahead and swept away any doubt about his right to be president,'' said an administration source, who declined to be named. <PERSON> Roh </PERSON>, who won presidential elections in December 1987 with 36 percent of the vote, is mistrusted by people suspicious of his close ties to former authoritarian President <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> <PERSON> Doo-hwan </PERSON>. Many Koreans, however, are tired of politics after years of upheaval and do n't want new instability, analysts say. <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> has shielded <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> against opposition demands the former president be made to account for corruption and human rights abuses under his rule. The two took power with military backing in 1980. Dissidents and radical students who have called for <PERSON> Roh </PERSON>'s ouster are not seen as a major threat despite frequent violent demonstrations, most analysts say, because the radicals lack significant public support do to their extremism and violence. The <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION>, a new dissident alliance that claims <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> is a front for military rule, has failed to gain strong public support, and turnout for its rallies has been small. <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> ordered a crackdown on the radicals after criticism from conservatives about the administration's failure to end violent protests. `` Hardliners in the military have voiced strong concern over the way <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> has handled leftists and violent laborers and students,'' said political analyst Park Moo-jong. The main opposition parties also have not played a big role. The two main opposition parties headed by <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Dae-jung </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Young-sam </PERSON> remain locked in a bitter rivalry that reduces their ability to work against the government. <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> also has started to move against hardliners within the government and military who have been critical of his moderate policies and worried that he may not be able to maintain public order. Government officials said Wednesday that hardline generals in key posts were being retired or moved to lesser posts in a shakeup involving 49 generals. The military, which took power twice in the past, has been a major political force in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s 40 year history. The government reportedly is divided into moderates loyal to <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> and rival hardliners unhappy that rapid democratic reforms are threatening their hold on power and allowing opposition groups to flourish, causing social unrest. <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> is seeking ties with communist nations to ease tension with <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>; hardliners are clinging to the anti-communism that dominated South Korean policy for decades. <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> moved against his hardline critics after a series of incidents showed right wing opposition within the government was growing. Cabinet minister <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Yong-kap </PERSON>, regarded as the leading hardliner in <PERSON> Roh </PERSON>'s government, resigned in March to protest what he said was a growing threat from leftists. `` I turned in my resignation to give a warning to people against the worsening political situation,'' the former general said.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said today he will send <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> `` in the next few days'' his recommendations for pay raises for top federal officials, members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and judges. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> made the commitment as the private <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> suggested pay raises for federal officials virtually as high as the increases that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> killed in February. Neither <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> nor White House spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> indicated what <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s recommendation would be. `` This is very timely,'' the president told members of the commission, which is headed by former <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Volcker </PERSON>. `` In the next few days, I'll be making some very specific proposals.'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> reiterated to reporters <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s view that there should be pay raises for federal executives, judges and members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, although he said no decisions had been made about recommendations to <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said that in the meeting, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had pointed out that `` it was important for the president to speak out and to set a tone and prevent a morale problem in the civil service.'' But the spokesman also said `` I'm not aware of a morale problem.'' House Majority Whip <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON>, however, said he considered it unlikely that members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> would be willing to consider another pay raise this year. `` Will something get done this year? I doubt it,'' said <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON>, D-Calif., in a telephone interview `` Something needs to be done but I'm not at all optimistic.'' The private study panel headed by <PERSON> Volcker </PERSON> today recommended pay increases of approximately 50 percent over two years for these federal officials. The pay increases suggested by <PERSON> Volcker </PERSON>'s commission roughly parallel those called for by a congressionally created panel and endorsed by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> as well as his predecessor, <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. Those increases were rejected by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in the face of intense public criticism centering on the proposed pay raise for the lawmakers. The private commission also recommended that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> prohibit its members from receiving speaking honoraria and other outside income related to their public responsibilities, saying that otherwise the increase would be more likely to be `` perceived by the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people as excessive.'' `` Not only does such income create lingering doubts about the need for an across-the-board increase, but it also undermines public trust in national institutions,'' the panel said. The commission, which includes former President <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ford </PERSON> and former Vice President <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mondale </PERSON> among its 36 members, also suggested pay increases for lower-ranking government workers. It recommended that these raises be phased in and the cost of them absorbed through reductions in employment or the elimination of government programs. The commission recommended that pay for civil service workers be varied depending on the cost of living in different parts of the country. <PERSON> Volcker </PERSON> said that based on talks with some members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, `` I do find some renewal of interest in the subject'' of pay increases. Sen. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Robb </PERSON>, D-Va., a member of the commission, said he detected on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> `` a feeling that something needs to be done in all areas. But he said some lawmakers strongly oppose the commission's recommendation that speaking honoraria for lawmakers be outlawed and that their salaries perhaps be considered separately from those of judges and executive branch officials `` Do n't underestimate a few committed souls,'' <PERSON> Robb </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Fraser </PERSON>, former president of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Automobile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> and a member of the commission, said that organized labor generally supports the commission's report, but disagrees with the proposal that pay vary from locality to locality. `` It creates in many cases gross inequalities,'' <PERSON> Fraser </PERSON> said. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON>, director of public relations for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Employees </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, said the commission's report `` really does n't address the lower-grade or rank-and-file federal employees.'' `` It holds out the false hope that pay increases for these people can be absorbed in current agency budgets or through reductions in force,'' <PERSON> King </PERSON> said. He said that his organization, which claims to represent 144,000 federal workers, seeks annual pay raises of 6 percent, or 3 percent above inflation, whichever is larger, and advocates agency-by-agency bargaining. The commission was formed after a conference held in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> in 1987 by the liberal <ORGANIZATION> Brookings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institution </ORGANIZATION> and the conservative <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enterprise </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>. It reported that the purchasing power of executive, judicial and legislative salaries has fallen by 35 percent since 1969 and recommnded that they be restored to the 1969 purchasing power level. This would require an increase of about 50 percent. The commission recommended that 25 percent of the increase be granted now and the rest by the beginning of the new <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in 1991. If <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> is unable to act on its own salaries, even though they are phased in and accompanied by a ban on speaking fees, the commission recommended that the president submit separate pay raises for judges and senior executives. If increases for senior political employees are delayed, the president and <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> should raise a current limit on top-level career employees even if this means that they make more than the political appointees who are above them, the commission said.

 Attorney General <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> today said 127 people have been charged in investigation he said smashed a billion-dollar international money-laundering ring with links to the <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> drug cartel of <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> called it `` the largest money-laundering crackdown ever carried out by the federal government.'' Authorities seized a half-ton of cocaine and $ 45 million in cash, jewelry and real estate, and have identified more assets for potential seizure, he said. `` There is no more effective way to deal with the business of drug trafficking than to take the profit out of it. That's what has happened with Operation Polar Cap,'' <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> said at a news conference. Federal authorities also obtained conspiracy indictments against two <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> banks, <ORGANIZATION> Banco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> de </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Occidente </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Banco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> de </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Occidente </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>, on charges they were involved in laundering more than $ 1 billion in drug proceeds generated in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Appearing with <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> was <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> Director <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sessions </PERSON>, Drug Enforcement Administrator <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawn </PERSON> and other federal authorities. Lawn said the sophisticated and complicated money-laundering operation laundered $ 1.2 billion in two years. <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> called it `` a very hostile takeover of a major money-laundering operation.'' <PERSON> Lawn </PERSON> said federal investigators in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> were told by drug-world leaders that the money-laundering scheme they were operating undercover was processing the money too slowly and described a faster Los Angeles-based operation that could launder their money in 48 hours. He said it was called `` La Mina,'' or `` The Mine,'' and that authorities began investigating that operation. He said it involved transfers of drug-proceeds and laundered money through several cities and <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Uruguay </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said that among the indictments resulting from the investigation were charges against 29 people unsealed today in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> and eight people arrested Tuesday evening in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Pagel </PERSON>, an attorney in the department's narcotics section, said most of the 127 people charged in the investigation had been arrested but that authorities were still pursuing some. The department said the <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> indictment traces the establishment of the money-laundering enterprise directly to leaders of the Colombian <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> cartel, which authorities say is the source of 80 percent of the cocaine consumed in this country. Federal agents were seizing accounts at banks in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, and additional arrests were expected in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, the department said. <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> said there was no evidence of illegal activity by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> banks, and that the banks cooperated in the investigation. Lawn said authorities also hoped to make an arrest today in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> with the help of the Panamanian Defense Forces. <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> said federal authorities continued to cooperate with the force, despite the pending federal drug indictment against <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> leader <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>.

 A new tabloid hits the streets this fall, offering <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> the prospect of an old-fashioned newspaper war. The established paper already has served notice it wo n't concede so much as one reader to the upstart. <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Ingersoll </PERSON> II on Tuesday announced plans for a `` visually dynamic'' paper called the <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sun </LOCATION>. He said it will be published seven mornings a week and will be competitive with the 111-year-old <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Louis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post-Dispatch </ORGANIZATION> from day one. `` The Sun will be profitable in the second year of its operation, and it will continue to grow,'' he predicted. <ORGANIZATION> Ingersoll </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Publications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> publishes more than 40 daily newspapers and more than 150 non-daily papers in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Post-Dispatch </ORGANIZATION>, owned by the Pulitzer family since its inception, has been the city's only daily newspaper since the <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Louis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Globe-Democrat </ORGANIZATION> folded under financial strain in 1986. `` Competition is the way of life in the American system,'' said <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Pulitzer </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Post-Dispatch </ORGANIZATION> chairman. But he added, `` We'll beat the pants off them. <PERSON> Ingersoll </PERSON>, chairman and chief executive of <ORGANIZATION> Ingersoll </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Publications </ORGANIZATION>, will start his venture with the help of a top <ORGANIZATION> Post-Dispatch </ORGANIZATION> executive, who resigned from that paper Tuesday morning. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Tallarico </PERSON>, 44, a senior vice president and general manager of the <ORGANIZATION> Post-Dispatch </ORGANIZATION> since 1986, will be publisher of the Sun. `` The <PERSON> Post-Dispatch </PERSON>'s mission will remain the same, as will its character,'' said Editor <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Woo </PERSON>. `` Competition focuses, competition sharpens and competition quickens. All of those things are good _ for newspapers or any other business. But I am not prepared to concede one single reader to <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Ingersoll </PERSON>.'' Ingersoll would not divulge start-up costs but said the first run of the newspaper will be 200,000 copies. He said the newspaper could be profitable with a circulation of fewer than 100,000. Weekday paid circulation for the <PERSON> Post-Dispatch </PERSON> is about 378,000 with 554,000 copies on Sundays. `` It has been an old saw that big cities can really only have one successful newspaper,'' Mayor <PERSON> Vincent </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Schoemehl </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> said. `` I think a new sense of competitiveness, new technology and a new aggressiveness in the media industry makes that old saw sawdust.'' `` It can only help to have another public voice,'' said <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Klotzer </PERSON>, editor of the <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Louis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journalism </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Review </ORGANIZATION>. `` The big thing is, are they going to get the big advertisers?

<TEXT>
 Federal regulators said Wednesday they had seized control of most of <ORGANIZATION> MCorp </ORGANIZATION>, an $ 18 billion, Dallas-based bank holding company, pumping in $ 300 million in what will likely become the third largest commercial bank rescue ever. The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deposit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> packaged 20 <ORGANIZATION> MCorp </ORGANIZATION> subsidiary banks into a new, government-owned institution with $ 15.4 billion in assets and $ 11.6 billion in deposits. Left alone were five still-solvent subsidiary banks and a trust company. <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Seidman </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION>, which insures commercial bank deposits up to $ 100,000, said the agency will seek buyers for the new institution. He declined to estimate how much government aid will ultimately be required, saying he did not want to reveal the figure to potential bidders. Private analysts have said they expect the failure will cost the <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION>, already depleted by a post-Depression record of 221 bank failures last year, $ 1 billion to $ 2 billion. That would make the transaction the third most costly commercial bank rescue, after <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> in 1984 and First RepublicBank of <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> in 1988, which required initial government pledges of $ 4.5 billion and $ 4 billion, respectively. Both, like <ORGANIZATION> MCorp </ORGANIZATION>, were holding companies. The <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION> insurance fund suffered its first loss ever in 1988, declining from $ 18.3 billion to $ 14 billion. <PERSON> Seidman </PERSON> said the fund should break even this year, even with spending for MCorp. As part of legislation to bail out the savings and loan industry, President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is proposing to build up the commercial bank insurance fund by nearly doubling the deposit insurance premium paid by banks. Earlier this year, when the <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION> was trying to sell <ORGANIZATION> MCorp </ORGANIZATION> in its entirety, the agency had set an April 3 deadline for offers, but <PERSON> Seidman </PERSON> said that may be extended. `` We are going to proceed with the sale as promptly as possible,'' he said. In <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> MCorp </ORGANIZATION> said the five remaining banks and the trust subsidiary `` form the nucleus of a new beginning for <ORGANIZATION> MCorp </ORGANIZATION>,'' which intends to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. `` While the nature of <ORGANIZATION> MCorp </ORGANIZATION> has been altered dramatically, a solid, healthy core remains,'' Chairman <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bishop </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Seidman </PERSON> said the failed banks opened for business today and `` as far as the customers are concerned it will be business as usual.'' <ORGANIZATION> MCorp </ORGANIZATION>, which has 86 offices, lost $ 903 million from its banking operations last year. It is the last of the large <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> banks needing to be recapitalized, either through federal rescue or private merger. The bulk of the assets were in the subsidiaries in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>, $ 6.4 billion, and <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>, $ 3.2 billion. Until last year, many analysts had thought MCorp, which had not invested as heavily in energy projects as other <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> banks, might survive. But heavy losses on real estate loans evenutally dragged it under. Comptroller of the Currency <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Clarke </PERSON>, the chief regulator of nationally chartered banks, said the failures were triggered by demands beginning Monday on the lead bank in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>, both from depositors and from the other banks in the holding company. On Tuesday, `` it became clear as the day wore on that the -LRB- <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> -RRB- bank was not going to be able to meet the demands of depositors,'' <PERSON> Clarke </PERSON> said. Five of the banks had been insolvent on their; 15 more failed after the <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> bank could not meet their demands for deposits. The demands of all outside customers were met, he said. Federal action was complicated by the fact that regulators legally could not take control of the five <ORGANIZATION> MCorp </ORGANIZATION> subsidiary banks that remain solvent. A legal battle is developing between private creditors and the <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION> over assets held by the holding company. Regulators claim holding company assests should be used to defer federal costs in rescuing the insolvent subsidiary banks, but <ORGANIZATION> MCorp </ORGANIZATION> has resisted. <PERSON> Seidman </PERSON> declined to say how large the claim against the holding company is except that it is `` substantial.'' The insurance fund last year had been trying to force the holding company to inject $ 400 million into 18 of its banks. For future cases, the <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION> is seeking legislation from <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> that would permit it to force solvent subsidiary banks to back up sister institutions that fail. The <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION>'s move came a week after creditors of <ORGANIZATION> MCorp </ORGANIZATION> forced it to seek protection under Chapter 11 of the Federal Bankruptcy Code. The holding company had halted payments on $ 466 million in debt last October but had asked creditors to refrain from pressing their claims while it attempted to work out an assistance agreement with the <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION> appointed <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Gardner </PERSON>, chairman of MBank <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>, as president of its new government-owned institution. The agency said it will seek a new chairman from outside the MCorp system. Reportedly among those interested in buying <ORGANIZATION> MCorp </ORGANIZATION> is <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Abboud </PERSON>, chairman of <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bancorporation </ORGANIZATION>, which was itself rescued by the <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION> in 1987 with $ 1 billion. Other likely bidders are <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kravis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Roberts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, the <PERSON> Pritzker </PERSON> family of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> and a group led by <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Gray </PERSON>, former chairman of <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technologies </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. The 20 <ORGANIZATION> MCorp </ORGANIZATION> banks seized are MBank <LOCATION> Abilene </LOCATION>, MBank <LOCATION> Alamo </LOCATION>, MBank <LOCATION> Austin </LOCATION>, MBank <LOCATION> Brenham </LOCATION>, MBank <LOCATION> Corsicana </LOCATION>, MBank <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>, MBank <LOCATION> Denton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> MBank </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION>, MBank <LOCATION> Greenville </LOCATION>, MBank <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>, <PERSON> MBank </PERSON> <PERSON> Jefferson </PERSON>, MBank <LOCATION> Longview </LOCATION>, <PERSON> MBank </PERSON> <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON>, MBank Midcities, MBank <LOCATION> Odessa </LOCATION>, MBank Orange, MBank Round Rock, <PERSON> MBank </PERSON> <PERSON> Sherman </PERSON>, MBank <LOCATION> Wichita </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Falls </LOCATION> and MBank The Woodlands.

<HEAD>Drop in Economic Forecasting Gauge Adds to Evidence of Slowdown</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NANCY BENAC</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The government reported Wednesday that its chief economic forecasting gauge dropped 0.3 percent in February, corroborating other signs of a slowdown in the economic expansion. Last month's decline in the Index of Leading Economic Indicators, a composite of forward-looking business statistics, was matched by a comparable dip last September and was the biggest drop since a fall of 0.8 percent last July. Analysts said February's decline was consistent with other recent signals that the economy may be losing steam _ welcome news to those who say growth must slow in order to keep inflation from spiraling. `` This should reduce concern about the economy overheating, while the decline is not sharp enough to give any signal of a recession,'' said <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Jasinowski </PERSON>, chief economist for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturers </ORGANIZATION>. Others, however, are concerned that the economy will slow too much and that the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>'s yearlong campaign to raise interest rates and dampen inflationary pressures will stifle growth altogether. `` The monetary tightening that we have experienced and some monetary tightening that is probably still to come are going to cause a downturn,'' said economist <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` I think that we're going to have a recession by the end of the year.'' <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> policy-makers are `` doing what they have to do'' to cure inflation, with a recession likely to be the unintended side effect. Last month's drop in the leading index added to a series of government reports on the economy's performance in February that pointed downward, including decreases in manufacturing employment, housing construction and orders for durable goods. In other evidence of a weakening economy, the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> reported Wednesday that sales of new, single-family homes in February plunged 9.4 percent to their lowest level in more than a year. Analysts blame the slow sales pace on the pinch of higher mortgage interest rates which forced some lower-income buyers out of the market. `` The first people forced out of the market in times of rising rates are first-time buyers who barely qualify to buy a home,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tuccillo </PERSON>, chief economist for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Realtors </ORGANIZATION>. The leading index, designed to foretell economic activity six to nine months into the future, had advanced 0.6 percent in December and 0.7 percent in January after vacillating during much of 1988. Economist <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Hagens </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> WEFA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> in <PERSON> Bala </PERSON> <PERSON> Cynwyd </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, said the latest decline in the index was not enough evidence to signal a future recession, but is `` consistent with our view that we are going to have a period of prolonged slowing of growth beginning in the second half of this year and carrying through the first half of next year.'' Whether the slowdown turns into a recession will depend on how deftly the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> maneuvers as it tries to slow growth just enough to bring inflation under control, <PERSON> Hagens </PERSON> said. In February, eight of the 11 indicators that make up the leading index declined, with the biggest negative factor being a drop in manufacturer orders for new plants and equipment. The other negative factors were a drop in building permits, a decline in manufacturers' orders for consumer goods, a contraction in the money supply, a dip in an index of consumer expectations, an increase in initial claims for unemployment benefits, faster vendor deliveries to companies signaling slower demand and a decline in manufacturers' unfilled orders. Two indicators made positive contributions: an increase in prices for raw materials indicating stronger demand, and rising stock prices. One indicator was unchanged last month: the length of the average work week. The various changes left the index at 145.2 percent of its 1982 base of 100. At the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, presidential press secretary <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> noted that the index stands 3.5 percent ahead of where it was a year ago, adding: `` One month's figures do n't provide a real basis for judging any change in that trend.'' The traditional signal of an oncoming recession is three straight declines in the leading index. The components of the composite index were revised last month to improve its forecasting abilities, but when the new index is applied retroactively, it flashes two false recession signals since the last economic downturn in 1981-82.

<HEAD>IRS Says Half of Americans Still Haven't Filed Tax Returns</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM LUTHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Tax Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Heading into the final three weeks of the tax preparation season, more than half of Americans still had not mailed their tax returns, the <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday. Through last Friday, the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> had received 53.1 million returns, up 0.7 percent from 52.8 million during the same period a year ago. The <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> expects 109 million individual returns will be filed this year _ although several million of them will not come in by the April 17 deadline. Nearly 32 million returns are expected in the final two weeks of the season, but the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> is n't worried about a crush. That represents almost 30 percent of the total, about the same as in past years, the agency said. While filings are up slightly, the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> is processing returns 3.3 percent faster than a year ago. The agency said 42.4 million returns have made their way through the system, compared with just under 41.1 million during the same period last year. More than 74 percent of the processed returns have been certified for refunds totaling $ 25.6 billion, an average refund of almost $ 816. At this time last year, 75 percent of filers had refunds approved; those refunds average $ 817. `` Refunds are still going out within six weeks, but those who file closer to the deadline will probably have to wait longer for their refund,'' the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> said. The statistic that pleases <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> most is one showing that the number of taxpayers filing returns electronically is more than double last year's. Through March 23, the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> had received 981,107 electronic returns, compared with 464,284 at the same time a year ago. Electronic filing is available in most states this year but only for returns that are due a refund. The return must be filed through a professional preparer who has been licensed by the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION>. Such a return saves the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> considerable paperwork and processing expense and can produce a refund within two or three weeks. Another trend that was spotted early this year is continuing: fewer taxpayers are calling the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> with specific tax questions. At this time last year, the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> toll-free phones had received 20.6 million calls; that is down to 19.3 million this year. The <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> has no way of knowing whether that dropoff was caused by widespread publicity about the agency's high error rate in answering questions, which in some areas has approached 50 percent. The number of taxpayers taking advantage of another type of telephone assistance, Tele-Tax, exceeds 15 million this year, compared with 5.4 million at this time a year ago. Tele-Tax, whose toll-free numbers and subject list are included in the back of the instruction packages mailed by the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION>, offers tape-recorded advice on more than 140 tax topics.

<TEXT>
 Fishermen in a mosquito fleet of small vessels worked with booms, rakes and shovels to save their livelihood today while accusing <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> of botching the cleanup of the nation's worst-ever oil spill. The last-ditch effort concentrated on the southwest portion of once-pristine Prince <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sound </PERSON>. Fishermen said they hope to protect important salmon hatcheries. One estimate put the season's losses at more than $ 150 million as a result of the spill, which occurred Friday when the <PERSON> Exxon </PERSON> <PERSON> Valdez </PERSON> ran onto a reef and leaked 240,000 barrels of the 1.2 million aboard the tanker. `` There is definitely a sense of hopelessness, that ca n't be avoided,'' said <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Lamb </PERSON>, acting president of the <ORGANIZATION> Cordova </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fishermen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION>. `` Exxon did screw up, no doubt about it. But what we're trying to do is maintain our focus and get this thing cleaned up. `` Our feelings have to be set aside to get this cleaned up. Then we can start dealing with the companies.'' In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> today, <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> today cited `` good cooperation'' in the effort to stop the oil slick in Prince <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sound </PERSON> and suggested a federal takeover of the cleanup may not be necessary. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> talked with President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> from <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> and reported that `` things were more positive than they might have believed.'' <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> is in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> with Adm. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Yost </PERSON>, commandant of the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION>; and <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Reilly </PERSON>, administrator of the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> sent them because of conflicting reports on whether <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> was doing enough. Exxon was assisted by the state, the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> and local fishermen in trying to clean up the slick and protect hundreds of pristine islands in its path. Since the tanker ran aground Friday, the 10.1 million gallons of crude oil have moved more than 40 miles, contaminating some beaches and marine life in the wildlife-rich sound. <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shipping </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. President <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Iarossi </PERSON> conceded earlier this week that the cleanup `` is not proceeding well _ believe me, that is an understatement We've got a mess on our hands.'' Gov. <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Cowper </PERSON> today said <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION>'s response to the spill was so late and inadequate that authorities are losing hope of cleaning up the mess. `` Just about all we can do is to act in specific areas. For instance we're trying to save the hatchery areas,'' he said on <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Good Morning America.'' <PERSON> Cowper </PERSON>, a Democrat, said it was the oil company's legal duty to respond first to the spill, `` and they did n't do a good job, to put it charitably.'' `` I think clearly in the beginning the response was very poor,'' he said. `` Then the weather got bad for a day or so. I think now the effort's being coordinated farily well, but it's pretty late.'' Mayor <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Devens </PERSON> said, `` I think the hatcheries are saveable. I think that's where the effort has to be placed now. ... We think we've probably lost our herring season. We're likely to lose a good bit of our salmon season. ... The value, just the fishing season is going to be in excess of $ 150 million.'' The <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Diego </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, meanwhile, reported today that the <PERSON> Exxon </PERSON> <PERSON> Valdez </PERSON> was built without a dual bottom, which can lessen the risk of a puncture causing a leak. `` It's a question of economics. It's much cheaper to build a single-skin ship,'' said Lt. Cmdr. <PERSON> Woody </PERSON> <PERSON> Loveland </PERSON>, who was the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION>'s chief marine safety officer in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> when the <LOCATION> Valdez </LOCATION> was built. Many tankers were constructed with protective hulls in anticipation of regulations requiring them, <LOCATION> Loveland </LOCATION> said, but the design feature was dropped for some ships when it became evident such a requirement would not be enacted. Though industry sources agree that double bottoms prevent spills under certain circumstances, their effectiveness remains open to debate when ships run hard into rocks or other obstructions as the <PERSON> Valdez </PERSON> apparently did. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Golob </PERSON>, publisher of <PERSON> Golob </PERSON>'s Oil Pollution Bulletin, said most tankers have single bottoms. `` A double bottom, although it provides an additional level of safety, does not necessarily provide a cure-all in the event of a major accident,'' he said. In the fishing village of <PERSON> Cordova </PERSON>, 50 miles to the southeast, angry residents packed a high school gymnasium Tuesday night for a meeting with state and <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> officials. Many of the town's 2,500 residents had opposed using <PERSON> Valdez </PERSON> as the southern terminus for the Alaskan pipeline. Resident <PERSON> Marla </PERSON> <PERSON> Adkins </PERSON> said the oil industry had promised to have adequate equipment on hand to handle any spills. `` What happened here is not what we were told would happen 10 years ago,'' she said. Fisherman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Booren </PERSON> said he feared publicity about the spill would destroy the market for the area's fish, even if the damage were contained.

 The state <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> today debated whether to censure rather than impeach Treasurer <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Manchin </PERSON> for his handling of an investment fund that lost $ 279 million. Delegate <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Pitrolo </PERSON>, <PERSON> Manchin </PERSON>'s chief defender, asked for censure, telling fellow lawmakers they were `` standing here today on the threshold of history. You will decide how we will be judged for the rest of our political lives.'' The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, in a 17-7 vote Monday, recommended 18 articles of impeachment against <PERSON> Manchin </PERSON>. If the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> impeaches <PERSON> Manchin </PERSON> and the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> convicts him, he will lose his job and possibly his pension, estimated at $ 2,128 a month. `` I have not harmed the people of this state in any way at all. There has been no proof of malfeasance. I do know that justice will prevail,'' the 61-year-old <PERSON> Manchin </PERSON>, a two-term Democrat, said Tuesday. Before Pitrolo spoke, Democratic Delegate <PERSON> Ramona </PERSON> <PERSON> Cerra </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> she received three threatening telephone calls Tuesday night. She did not detail the nature of the threats or say from whom they came. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> also was to consider a censure motion against Auditor <PERSON> Glen </PERSON> <PERSON> Gainer </PERSON>, 60, a four-term Democrat. He and <PERSON> Manchin </PERSON> served on the <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investments </ORGANIZATION>, which had general supervision of the fund. Some delegates predicted a wide margin in favor of impeachment, which requires a simple majority, but <PERSON> Pitrolo </PERSON> said the vote would be close. `` I'm giving them an option to look at the evidence and arrive at a decision that while the evidence is not strong enough to warrant impeachment, there was evidence that some sort of action should be taken,'' <PERSON> Pitrolo </PERSON> said. Delegate <PERSON> Marc </PERSON> <PERSON> Harman </PERSON>, who is leading the impeachment effort, called it `` a heart and mind issue, an emotional issue.'' The impeachment resolution said <PERSON> Manchin </PERSON> failed to supervise the state's consolidated investment fund, which was under the control of his office. It accused him for delegating too much authority, making improper investments, paying out interest that was not earned and covering up the losses. <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Tucker </PERSON> has notified the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> to be ready to hear the case in late May if the House votes to impeach. Twenty-three of the 34 senators would have to vote to convict.

 A new study concludes that skewing the <ORGANIZATION> Census </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION>'s national headcount, as has been proposed in various forms by lawmakers and special interest groups, would make little difference in the allocation of House seats.

But even combining the various suggested adjustments would shift a maximum of just four additional seats among <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>, population analyst <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Hare </PERSON> reports. `` It appears that none of the adjustments to Census figures that are being urged upon the bureau are likely to make a big difference in the overall apportionment of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>,'' <LOCATION> O'Hare </LOCATION> reported in the latest issue of `` Population Today,'' the newsletter of the private <ORGANIZATION> Population </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION>. The census, taken every 10 years, is required by the Constitution to redistribute the 435 House seats, keeping them relatively even in population. Because the number of <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> members is limited, whenever a state gains a seat, another state must lose one. Last year the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, which oversees the <ORGANIZATION> Census </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION>, decreed that the 1990 results would not be adjusted. Various interest groups, however, continue to push the idea. Several lawsuits and congressional bills have been filed seeking to force changes. The main dispute over adjusting the count centers on either increasing the totals to add minorities presumed to have been missed or reducing the total to subtract illegal aliens or people who are `` imputed.'' Imputed people are those counted despite the fact that Census officials do not actually contact them. For example, when neighbors say someone lives at a house even though the census taker repeatedly can not locate those people, that person is counted. The suit contending minorities are undercounted was filed in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION> by <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Dade </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>; the <ORGANIZATION> NAACP </ORGANIZATION> and groups representing Hispanics and the nation's mayors. A separate suit, seeking to remove the effect of illegal aliens, was filed in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION> by the <ORGANIZATION> Immigration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reform </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> on behalf of 42 members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> and the Federation for American Immigration Reform. An analysis of the 1980 census concluded that more than 5 percent of blacks and Hispanics were missed, considerably more than the number of whites who were said to have been uncounted. Thus, interest groups have urged increasing the minority count in each state by a predetermined percentage. Such a move would be expected to benefit states with large minority populations, but <LOCATION> O'Hare </LOCATION>'s calculations said that would not be the case. `` Interestingly,'' concluded <LOCATION> O'Hare </LOCATION>, `` minority undercount adjustment, the modification of the census figures which has received the most attention, would not result in the movement of any seats between states.'' On the other hand, he calculated that eliminating illegal aliens from the count would result in the transfer of one House seat from <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>. `` This is not surprising when you realize that the 1980 census figures for <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> included an estimated 1 million illegal aliens,'' <LOCATION> O'Hare </LOCATION> commented. Taking them out of the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> population would cost that state a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> seat; <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> would be next in line for that seat. Some states are more difficult to count and thus have more imputed people than others, <LOCATION> O'Hare </LOCATION> found. He estimated that subtracting imputed people from the count would cost <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> a seat. Once again, the gainer would be <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> O'Hare </LOCATION> also calculated the results of various combinations of these adjustments: _ Adding in allegedly uncounted minorities and subtracting estimated illegal aliens would move one seat from <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> _ Adding in minorities and subtracting the imputed people would transfer seats from <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> _ Subtracting both illegal aliens and imputed people would move one <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> seat from <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> _ Making all three adjustments would move one seat from <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> The various changes calculated by <LOCATION> O'Hare </LOCATION> would be in addition to reallocartions of House seats caused by discernable shifts in population since 1980. While the exact shifts wo n't be known until after the census, the <ORGANIZATION> Population </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> and the private <ORGANIZATION> Election </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> have projected changes based on recent <ORGANIZATION> Census </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> population estimates. Both groups anticipate the shift of 18 seats from northern states to the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> and West, mirroring the flow of population. Gainers are expected to be: <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, 5; <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, 4; <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, 3; <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>, 2; <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, 2; <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, 1 and <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, 1. Expected to lose seats are: <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, 3; <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, 3; <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, 2; <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, 2; <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, 2; <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, 1; <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>, 1; <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, 1; <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>, 1; <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, 1, and <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>, 1.

 Two Czechoslovak teen-agers shot their way onto a jetliner Wednesday in <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> and ordered it to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, but the crew convinced them it could n't fly that far and they gave up in <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION>.

Police said no one was hurt and the incident ended peacefully less than three hours after its violent start in the Czechoslovak capital, where nearly all passengers were freed. Witnesses at <LOCATION> Ruzyne </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> said the teen-agers took a woman hostage, crashed through a glass wall of the VIP lounge, fired several shots and threatened a stewardess. About 100 people were reported to be on Tupolev-154 of the Hungarian airline <ORGANIZATION> Malev </ORGANIZATION> whevening newscast, the <ORGANIZATION> ZDF </ORGANIZATION> television network mentioned `` unconfirmed reports'' that they wanted to stay in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Neitzel </PERSON> said the passengers still aboard the plane when it landed in <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> were three Hungarians, four Czechoslovaks, a Dutch citizen, two Canadians and a Romanian, as well as the crew of four. <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s news agency and <ORGANIZATION> CTK </ORGANIZATION>, the official Czechoslovak agency, said the flight crew convinced the young hijackers the plane could not cross the ocean and they then demanded to be taken to <ORGANIZATION> Barcelona </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>. After entering West German airspace, however, the youths told the pilot to land at <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> because they wanted to deal with the Americans at nearby military facilities, said <PERSON> Hans-Ulrich </PERSON> <PERSON> Ohl </PERSON>, head of the federal flight safety office in <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military authorities refused to allow the Hungarian jet onto Rhein-Main Air Base. <PERSON> Roland </PERSON> <PERSON> Desch </PERSON>, a police investigator, said a military truck was driven onto the taxiway to prevent the from entering the base. <PERSON> Karl-Heinz </PERSON> <PERSON> Wagner </PERSON>, another police spokesman, said the teen-agers carried a sawed-off shotgun, a rifle and a fake hand grenade. Airport spokesman <PERSON> Wolfgang </PERSON> <PERSON> Schwalm </PERSON> said they `` wanted to go to the American side of the airport.

 The death toll from clashes between police and ethnic Albanians in a southern province climbed to 23 on Wednesday when two wounded demonstrators died, the state news agency said. There were reports of attempted strikes and scattered street protests, but the region was relatively calm for the first day in about a week. A dusk-to-dawn curfew remained in force, and state TV showed army tanks and jets on maneuver in <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION> province. Police sources and witnesses, meanwhile, said the ferocity of the clashes in the province on Monday and Tuesday caught security forces off guard. <PERSON> Radmilo </PERSON> <PERSON> Bogdanovic </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Serbia </LOCATION>'s interior minister, told officials in <LOCATION> Belgrade </LOCATION> on Wednesday that only 2,400 police were deployed Monday against an estimated 14,000 ethnic <PERSON> Albanian </PERSON> demonstrators in <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION>. Although ethnic tension between Serbs and Albanians had been simmering for some time, few expected the protesters and police to open fire on each other with handguns and automatic weapons as they did in cities, towns and villages. One police officer said in an interview Wednesday that he was so frightened by the violence he stole a license plate from a wrecked civilian vehicle and put it on his police car so he could escape the fighting. Other officers, who also demanded anonymity, said demonstrators commandeered a bulldozer to attack security forces. Near <LOCATION> Pristina </LOCATION>, ethnic <PERSON> Albanians </PERSON> strafed a police helicopter from a minaret during the fighting Monday and Tuesday, police and witnesses said. In the town of <LOCATION> Decani </LOCATION>, where about 1,000 people battled police for two hours Tuesday, demonstrators injured 14 policemen by shooting from rooftops and the windows of buildings, the state news agency <ORGANIZATION> Tanjug </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday. In all, 23 people were killed and 74 injured. That official death toll is the highest reported from ethnic unrest in <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION> since the end of World War II. In 1981, at least nine people died in ethnic riots whose anniversary will be celebrated on Saturday. The latest protests in <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION>, which is part of the republic of <LOCATION> Serbia </LOCATION>, began last week after <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> approved constitutional changes giving <LOCATION> Serbia </LOCATION> control of the provincial police, courts and civil defense. <LOCATION> Serbia </LOCATION> said the changes are needed to protect the province's Slav minority from persecution at the hands of ethnic Albanians Ethnic Albanians, who make up 85 percent of <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION>'s 1.9 million citizens, say the changes threaten autonomy they won under the 1974 constitution. <ORGANIZATION> Tanjug </ORGANIZATION> reported scattered attempts at strikes and street protests Wednesday, the first day of relative calm in the province since <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> passed the disputed constitutional changes Thursday. <ORGANIZATION> Tanjug </ORGANIZATION> said police dispersed about 150 youths and detained 18 who tried to march to the center of the <LOCATION> west </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION> town of <LOCATION> Pec </LOCATION>. No injuries were reported. Police patrols thinned slightly in <LOCATION> Pristina </LOCATION> by late Wednesday. Two policemen _ a Serb and an ethnic Albanian _ were buried in two <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION> villages while police kept guard with Soviet-made T-55 tanks. <PERSON> Alia </PERSON> <PERSON> Shexholija </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief in the <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION> town of <LOCATION> Podujevo </LOCATION>, was quoted in the <LOCATION> Belgrade </LOCATION> daily <ORGANIZATION> Politika </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ekspres </ORGANIZATION> as saying the security forces reacted `` too mildly'' at the start of Monday's clashes. Police were not equipped to face such aggression and did n't even have bullet-proof vests, he said. Other papers reported that one injured officer died because his colleagues were unable to evacuate him quickly.

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on Wednesday embraced a private commission's report calling for federal pay increases as `` very timely'' and said he will promptly ask <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to raise the pay of top executive branch officials, senators, representatives and judges. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> spoke after receiving the recommendations of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, a 36-member panel headed by former <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Volcker </PERSON>. The group called for steps to make government jobs more attractive, including a pay raise nearly as large as the one <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> killed last month after public outcries over its magnitude. Neither <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> nor White House spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> indicated what <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s recommendation would be. It would have to be enacted by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. `` This is very timely,'' the president told members of the commission. `` In the next few days, I ` ll be making some very specific proposals.'' <PERSON> Volcker </PERSON> would not speculate on whether he believed <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> would endorse an increase, but said that based on talks with lawmakers, `` I do find some renewal of interest in the subject.'' House Majority Whip <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON>, D-Calif., was more pessimistic, saying, `` Will something get done this year I doubt it. Something needs to be done but I'm not at all optimistic.'' The commission's pay proposal is similar to one made in the final weeks of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration by a congressionally created commission that assesses federal pay every four years. Both then-President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> endorsed that proposed 51 percent increase, but it foundered on public opposition to a congressional pay raise. The <ORGANIZATION> Volcker </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> plan proposes some new wrinkles. For one thing, only 25 per cent of the increase would be effective immediately. The rest would wait until a new <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> convenes in 1991. For another, members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> would have to give up the speaking fees, or honoraria, with which many supplement their incomes. `` Not only does such income create lingering doubts about the need for an across-the-board increase, but it also undermines public trust in national institutions,'' the panel said. The commission also recommended pay increases for rank-and-file federal employees, but suggested they be absorbed into existing budgets by reductions in force and elimination of programs. It also suggested that the pay rates vary from locality to locality, based on the cost of living. Spokesmen for organized labor reacted coolly to this proposal. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sturdivant </PERSON>, national president of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Government </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Employees </ORGANIZATION>, endorsed the report `` as far as it goes,'' adding, `` Unfortunately, it is a jigsaw puzzle with some of the most important pieces missing.'' He said that besides giving raises to executives, non-management federal workers must also have their salaries raised to the level of their private sector counterparts `` Only after such action is taken can locality pay play a realistic role in bringing equity to federal workers,'' <PERSON> Sturdivant </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Fraser </PERSON>, former president of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Automobile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> and a member of the commission, said that organized labor generally supports the commission's report, but disagrees with the proposal that pay vary from locality to locality. `` It creates in many cases gross inequalities,'' <PERSON> Fraser </PERSON> said. Among other recommendations: _ The president should `` set the highest standards of ethical conduct for those who hold the public trust, and act quickly and firmly to remove those who violate that trust. _ The financial disclosure process, `` while a key protection against conflicts of interest, should be streamlined to ease the burdens on potential appointees.'' _ The number of presidential political appointees should be reduced from the current level of about 3,000 to about 2,000 and career officials should more frequently be considered for sub-cabinet appointments _ The president and <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> should establish a public service scholarship program open to 1,000 students who would receive tuition and costs in return for a commitment to a specified term of government service

Transportation Secretary <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON>, part of a high-level team of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials sent to study the oil spill from the grounded tanker <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Valdez </ORGANIZATION>, gave a preliminary report to President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> by phone, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. `` It was a brief conversation, but Secretary <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> reported good cooperation between the various authorities involved,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. He said <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> reported `` things were more positive than they might have believed.'' <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> is at the site with <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> Adm. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Yost </PERSON> and <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Reilly </PERSON>, administrator of the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>. They are due back on Thursday and will give a report to the president, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. Exxon, which is charged by law with the cleanup operation, was being assisted by the state, the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> and local fishermen in trying to contain the growing 100-square-mile slick and protect hundreds of pristine islands in its path. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on Tuesday had said there were `` conflicting reports'' on whether <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> was doing enough to try to contain damage from the oil spill, and said that a federal takeover of the cleanup was one option. However, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> told reporters on Wednesday that `` I would guide you a little bit away from that. The preliminary feeling is that the resources are there, on the job,'' and that the cleanup is probably as effective is it would be under federal supervision. However, he said `` there have been conflicting reports'' on <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION>'s role. `` That's why they're up there,'' he said, referring to the federal officials. The spill was caused after the oil tanker ran aground on Friday, spilling more than 10 million gallons of oil. `` The various parties there are working together, the governor's office, <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> and local fishermen are making a lot of efforts to bring in local citizens to help with the cleanup effort,'' the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said The three officials flew over the spill on Tuesday after their arrival, then met with <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> officials and with <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Cowper </PERSON>, a Democrat, who had criticized <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION>'s response as slow and inadequate. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> team, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said, `` did n't have any conclusions to report at this point other than to say there was good cooperation among the cleanup parties involved there, that everyone appeared to be dedicated and working as hard as possible.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has said that the oil spill would not diminish his support for a plan open a pristine arctic wildlife refuge to oil drilling. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> on Wednesday reiterated the administration's support for oil exploration in the <ORGANIZATION> Arctic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Refuge </ORGANIZATION>, on <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>'s northern reaches. `` He's saying his general policy has n't changed. He does n't want to signal any kind of other peripheral changes at this point until we know what we've learned from the oil spill,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. `` It may well be we could learn things that would be applicable.''

 Local politics overwhelmed even heavy White House campaigning in a special congressional election in which Democrats wrested away the seat once held by Vice President <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>. <PERSON> Jill </PERSON> <PERSON> Long </PERSON>, a business professor, used two county tax issues in her successful race against <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> opponent <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Heath </PERSON>, a former city official. Long's 1,700-vote margin Tuesday reversed her fortunes from last fall, when she lost the district race by 50,000 votes. `` -LRB- Heath -RRB- wanted to take the <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> tax pledge, but he had been in an administration involved in a tax raise,'' said <PERSON> Brad </PERSON> <PERSON> Senden </PERSON>, a consultant to <PERSON> Long </PERSON>'s campaign. `` So he was immediately involved in a contradiction.'' <PERSON> Heath </PERSON> was safety director under <PERSON> Fort </PERSON> <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Mayor </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Helmke </PERSON>, who recently engineered the passage of a 0.2 percent city income tax and sought annexation of a Republican-dominated county township, a move that would mean higher property tax rates. Long used both issues in her advertising, claiming the administration's tactics belied <PERSON> Heath </PERSON>'s campaign promise not to support tax increases. In his concession speech, <PERSON> Heath </PERSON> conceded the attacks hurt his candidacy. `` There are times when one must be sacrificed on the altar of good government, whether it be -LRB- tax -RRB- or annexation,'' he said. Long said her victory was not a rebuff for the White House or <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, who campaigned for <PERSON> Heath </PERSON>. `` This was just a race between two individuals in <LOCATION> northeast </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>,'' she said. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> called Long with congratulations, and `` offered to assist in any way because he's committed to the Fourth District,'' she said. Later, Long seemed to back away even from her campaign's tax issue attacks, saying the city administration's chief failure was not seeking broader resident involvement in the decision. `` It's a style of management rather than the issue itself,'' she said. Long had lost by landslide margins in 1986 and in her 1988 effort to oust <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> incumbent <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Coats </PERSON>. Some Democrats wrote off her political career after the second loss, but <PERSON> Long </PERSON> said she realized Coats, a former <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> aide to <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, might be appointed to fill his <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> seat. `` We kept our campaign headquarters open and assembled a team of private advisers,'' she said. Long had no opponents in the party nominating caucus, while <PERSON> Heath </PERSON>, then relatively unknown even in the city, was running in a field of nine candidates. Long becomes the first Democrat to hold the northeastern <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> seat since <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Roush </PERSON> lost to <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> in a 1976 re-election campaign. Long said her thoughts had not turned to the re-election effort that begins soon in a shortened 19-month term.

 With songs, bells and balloons, <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> is celebrating the 100th anniversary of the biggest land run in history. The big blow-out will come April 22 and mark the actual anniversary of the scramble by an estimated 40,000 people for 2 million acres of Indian Territory opened to white settlement. On Tuesday, school children and others in more than a half-dozen cities and towns watched a horseback rider re-enact the dispatching of President <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON> <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON>'s March 23, 1889, proclamation offering the free land. Planners figured that a century ago it probably took until March 28 for the news to travel to <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C </LOCATION>. The observance should help people understand that <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> history did not begin with the land run of 1889 and that Indians settled the area first and made it hospitable, Cherokee Chief <PERSON> Wilma </PERSON> <PERSON> Mankiller </PERSON> said. The celebration `` was pretty dad-gummed nice,'' <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Owens </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Crescent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Centennial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. `` We had over 100 direct descendants of' 89ers, those who had made the run,'' <PERSON> Owens </PERSON> said `` They registered with their name and the name of the ancestor who made the run.'' Then, each of those decendants `` took one stroke'' on the centennial bell that stands outside <ORGANIZATION> Centennial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Headquarters </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> in </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Crescent </ORGANIZATION>, a town of 1,700, he said. From there, the proclamation was carried by horseback to <PERSON> Guthrie </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Stillwater </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Norman </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Kingfisher </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> El </PERSON> <PERSON> Reno </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Guthrie </LOCATION>, the original state capital, the <ORGANIZATION> Langston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> choir and band offered patriotic music on the steps of the Scottish Rite Temple. Camp Fire boys and girls released hundreds of balloons carrying messages announcing the opening of the Unassigned Lands. In El <PERSON> Reno </PERSON>, on the other side of that once-forbidden zone, the centennial rider was intercepted by `` the cavalry'' and accused of being a Sooner _ one of those who did n't wait for the official opening. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> marshals threw the rider in jail as part of the spectacle. More balloons were released at <PERSON> Norman </PERSON>, and at <ORGANIZATION> Kingfisher </ORGANIZATION>, a girl's choir in period dress sang original songs and the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Legion </ORGANIZATION> fired a 21-gun salute. Coincidentally, the nation's second-largest <LOCATION> Indian </LOCATION> tribe, the Cherokees, are planning a more somber observance this weekend of the 150th anniversary of a forced march to <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> from their homes in the Southeast. The march along a path known as the Trail of Tears ended in March 1839.

 Sales of new, single-family homes slumped in February to the lowest level in more than a year, the government said Wednesday, and analysts expect further declines as rising mortgage rates push more people out of the market. Sales dropped 9.4 percent in February to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 626,000 after advancing 2.5 percent in January, when unusually mild weather brought out more buyers. The drop in sales was accompanied by an 8.9 percent increase in the median price of the homes sold, which analysts said showed that lower-income purchasers were the ones who left the market. `` The first people forced out of the market in times of rising rates are first-time buyers who barely qualify to buy a home,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tuccillo </PERSON>, chief economist of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Realtors </ORGANIZATION>. Last month's median price for a new home was $ 123,100, meaning half the homes sold for more and half for less. The average price, which is pulled up by sales of very expensive homes, was up 9.2 percent to $ 150,200. Analysts said that because the housing market is particularly sensitive to interest rates, it is among the sectors of the economy most directly affected as the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> tries to restrain growth and dampen inflationary pressures by driving rates upward. Housing construction and sales of existing homes also were down sharply during February, according to earlier reports from the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. `` The housing sector is stumbling,'' said economist <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` It's an indication that higher mortgage rates are taking a toll on the housing sector, one which is likely to intensify over the next couple of months.'' Fixed-rate home mortgages last week were averaging 11.22 percent, up from 9.99 percent a year earlier, according to a national survey by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mortgage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. One-year adjustable rate mortgages also were up sharply, with lenders asking an average initial rate of 9.3 percent last week, up from 7.52 percent a year earlier, <ORGANIZATION> Freddie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mac </ORGANIZATION> said. At the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, presidential press secretary <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said the decline in home sales reflected the higher interest rates and `` probably some slowing in the economy.'' It was the biggest decline since a 9.5 percent drop last November and left sales at the lowest rate since the 576,000 level of January 1988. <PERSON> Tuccillo </PERSON> said that with mortgage rates expected to continue rising through the spring, new home sales likely will decline further over the next few months and then start to pick up. <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Seiders </PERSON>, chief economist for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Builders </ORGANIZATION>, said sales for all of 1989 are expected to be down 6 percent from last year, but the situation could be worse if the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> tightens credit too severely. `` Our association is very uptight about what the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> has been doing,'' <PERSON> Seiders </PERSON> said. `` When the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> moves to slow down an economy like this, they almost always overshoot.'' The biggest drop in new home sales last month was recorded in the Northeast, where sales dropped 19.9 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 101,000. The Northeast market has weakened after several years in which strong sales resulted in overbuilding and inflated prices. Sales last month were off 14.4 percent in the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> to an annual rate of 214,000, down 1.4 percent in the West to 210,000, and down 1 percent in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> to 101,000.

<HEAD>Problems Lingering with Replacement for Colt .45</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 An effort by the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> and the Italian gunmaker <PERSON> Beretta </PERSON> to correct a fault in the military's new 9mm pistol has taken twice as long as expected and deliveries of the handgun wo n't resume until May, service officials say `` We have a design approved, but the production did n't get up and running as quickly as we had hoped,'' says Lt. Col. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Reitz </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> spokesman at the Pentagon. `` We do n't expect deliveries with the new design to begin until May,'' <PERSON> Reitz </PERSON> said in a recent interview. In the meantime, the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> has decided to reduce by two-thirds the number of times gun already in use may be fired before replacing the chamber slide mechanism, the defective part. Noting an accident earlier this year in which a chamber slide shattered, the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> reduced from 3,000 to 1,000 the number of firings allowed before the slide was replaced. The change is expected to have little effect for the time being `` because most personnel fire the pistol fewer than 100 times per year,'' the spokesman said. <LOCATION> Beretta </LOCATION> <LOCATION> USA </LOCATION>, which operates a manufacturing plant in <LOCATION> Accokeek </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, beat out seven competitors in 1985 for the right to provide 9mm guns to replace the military's venerable Colt .45. The <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, which has designated the 9mm pistol the M-9, is serving as the executive buying agent for all the services and awarded Beretta an initial contract worth $ 75 million for 315,000 pistols. <LOCATION> Beretta </LOCATION> <LOCATION> USA </LOCATION> is a subsidiary of the Italian arms maker <ORGANIZATION> Armi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beretta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> SpA </ORGANIZATION> and has so far delivered more than 140,000 pistols. It agreed last August to suspend deliveries, starting in September, until it corrected the problem of cracking slides. At the time, company and <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> officials announced that the gunmaker had agreed to change the way it made the metal slides by forging them with an improved heat process to ensure their strength. The company also agreed to fit each gun, including those already produced, with a pin device to capture any slide that did crack. The pin device would keep the slide or fragments from being thrown back into the shooter's chest or face in the event of a failure. When that agreement was hammered out last summer, <LOCATION> Beretta </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> officials said deliveries of the improved gun would begin in January. `` It's just taken longer than we thought,'' <PERSON> Reitz </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Reitz </PERSON> said the production delay was not having much of an impact on the services because `` the troops still have their older weapons; there's no shortage.'' <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Cole </PERSON>, a spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> Beretta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION>, said Wednesday the company planned to begin delivering in April new slides and safety pin devices for guns already in use. He agreed with <PERSON> Reitz </PERSON> that deliveries of complete pistols would not resume until May, but declined to detail the reasons for the additional delay. The January accident was the fifth in which a chamber slide on a Beretta cracked, sending fragments toward the shooter. In this case, <PERSON> Reitz </PERSON> said the incident left a Marine only slightly injured but prompted the Army to establish the new safety standard for gun useage. The slide bolt on the Beretta is thrown backward after a shot is fired as part of the process of loading a new round into the gun's chamber In a related development, the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s SEAL commando forces had `` backtracked'' and decided not to switch to the Beretta 9mm, in part because of concern over the slide failures `` The <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> agreed with that decision because of the special circumstances that apply,'' <PERSON> Reitz </PERSON> said. `` First of all, their level of usage is just incredible, as much as 30,000 rounds a year. And they're dragging the guns in and out of the water. So the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> decided to look at other pistols and the Army is going to do the same when it comes to our Special Operations Forces.''

<HEAD>U.S. Agrees To Compromise On European Demands For Farm Subsidies</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RUTH SINAI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, threatened with the collapse of international trade talks, has accepted a compromise on its controversial proposal to eliminate farm subsidies, agriculture officials said Wednesday. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> compromise may help break a stalemate with the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> that has derailed talks among 100 nations on liberalizing trade in everything from corn to computer chips. The controversy centers around the 12-nation <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION>'s rejection of a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> demand for elimination of farm supports, which the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> contends distort international trade. The sides were unable to reach a compromise at a meeting of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade in <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION> last December and postponed further negotiations until April 5 in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>. Other members of <ORGANIZATION> GATT </ORGANIZATION>, which regulates international commerce, have refused to take any action on other pressing trade problems until the two economic giants settle their agriculture clash. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has agreed to European language that would call for a `` progressive substantial reduction'' of support for farmers, but not total elimination, said Agriculture Secretary <PERSON> Clayton </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON>. Another <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official, speaking on condition he not be identified, said the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> had indicated to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> negotiators that it would accept the compromise language proposed by the Swiss chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> GATT </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Dunkel </PERSON>. `` What we have tried to do is state it in a manner that might be a little more palatable politically to our European counterparts,'' <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> said in an interview on <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON>, who represented the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> at the <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION> talks in his previous capacity as trade representative, denied the new formulation constituted a compromise for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` As I indicated, it may be slightly more palatable in <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, and if so we're glad to have it be accepted on that basis,'' <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> said. But that formulation `` will get us to the ultimate objective of getting rid of the trade-distorting kind of practices in agriculture around the world,'' he said. The <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION>, facing concerted pressure from a larger and more powerful farm lobby than the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has, contends it too would like to reduce agricultural subsidies but it can not accept a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> demand for their total elimination. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> says that as long as the Europeans support their farmers, it too must prop up American farmers so they can compete on world markets. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> supports, which go mostly for production, reached about $ 26 million in 1987 and dropped slightly last year because of the drought. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> position on farm supports has been gradually eroding since last year, when former President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> dropped his original goal for the worldwide elimination of farm subsidies by the year 2000. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> then took the position that it was not setting any date for elimination of the supports but was seeking instead a commitment from all <ORGANIZATION> GATT </ORGANIZATION> members for eventual elimination. In the absence of such a commitment, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> intends to press the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> at the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> meeting to reduce its export subsidy for farmers. <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has had to keep up with the Europeans by increasing export supports for farmers and `` it's really sheer economic madness. Another potential sticking point in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> is a new EEC demand that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> freeze current limitations on the size of farm lands used for production. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> asked farmers to idle some lands last year because of the drought. <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> said he would reject the EEC demand. `` The European community is trying to lock us into that position forever and we just ca n't afford to have that take place,'' he said. <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials say they will decide by June 1 whether to maintain the existing limitations on farm production, depending on their determination of the past winter's drought damage.

<HEAD>Detainee Takes Refuge at U.S. Consulate after Escape from Hospital</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A black detainee on a hunger strike escaped in his pajamas from a hospital Wednesday and took refuge at the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Consulate 360 miles away. Six other black activists were encamped at the British Embassy in <LOCATION> Pretoria </LOCATION>, demanding that police lift restrictions imposed on them after their release from detention. The embassy said it hoped the six would leave, but they were given blankets to spend the night. <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> <PERSON> Ntombela </PERSON>, a teacher and anti-apartheid organizer, escaped at daybreak from <LOCATION> Shifa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> in the port city of <LOCATION> Durban </LOCATION>, police said. Late in the afternoon, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> diplomats said <PERSON> Ntombela </PERSON> had reached the consulate on the 11th floor of a <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION> office building, apparently after taking a commercial flight from <LOCATION> Durban </LOCATION>. `` We have been in touch with the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> African </LOCATION> government with a view toward resolving this case as expeditiously as possible,'' said <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> Friedman </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> spokesman. <PERSON> Ntombela </PERSON>, 27, was the eighth detainee to escape from a hospital since September. He fled as the government announced plans to prevent future breakouts by moving hunger strikers to <LOCATION> Bloemfontein </LOCATION>, a relatively remote provincial capital. Three detainees who escaped in September holed up in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Consulate in <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION> for five weeks, and four detainees escaped to the <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> German </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Pretoria </LOCATION> this month. All seven were allowed to go free. <PERSON> Ntombela </PERSON>, detained since September, was hospitalized in early March for treatment of depression and began a hunger strike March 13, his lawyers said. Foreign Minister <PERSON> Pik </PERSON> <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> said police were studying <PERSON> Ntombela </PERSON>'s case and a decision would be made later as to whether he could go free <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> said the five men and one woman who entered the <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> at midday Wednesday would not be arrested if they left, even though some had violated their restrictions. The <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> said the group `` can not stay indefinitely on British government premises and should leave.'' One of the six was <PERSON> Donsie </PERSON> <PERSON> Khumalo </PERSON>, an official of the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> African Trade Unions, the main black labor federation. He was released last week after staging a hunger strike to protest being held without charge. The detainees are held under a state of emergency declared in June 1986 to quell anti-apartheid unrest in black townships. Like many other freed activists, <PERSON> Khumalo </PERSON>, 39, is barred from various political activities, required to report to a police station twice daily, and confined to his house at night.

Detainees held there would have more difficulty escaping and publicity about the hunger strike campaign might be reduced.

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> asked the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday to establish checkpoints along the Afghan-Pakistani border to prevent arms and troops from reaching Moslem guerrillas, a spokesman said. <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> made the request in a letter sent to <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Secretary-General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON>, said <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Nabi </PERSON> <PERSON> Amani </PERSON>. <PERSON> Amani </PERSON> also said guerrillas aided by Pakistani troops continued rocket and artillery fire in and around the city of <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION>, where guerrillas have surrounded government forces since March 6. <PERSON> Amani </PERSON> said the 11th and 18th divisions of <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>'s army were inside <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. In the last 24 hours, they had fired long-range weapons at Afghan government forces. <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> says the Pakistanis are sending a steady stream of troops and weapons to help the guerrillas, who have been fighting the Soviet-backed government for nine years. <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, like the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, supports the guerrillas but denies having troops in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. Neither the border post proposal nor the accusation against <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> is new, but the allegations have increased in vehemence and frequency since Feb. 15, when the last Soviet soldiers who had been backing <PERSON> Najib </PERSON>'s troops left the country. <PERSON> Amani </PERSON> said there was no doubt the government was `` dominant'' in the fight for <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION>, 75 miles east of <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>. He claimed that in the 24-hour period ending Wednesday evening, government forces killed 137 opposition fighters and injured 56. Afghan army troops suffered no casualties, he said. <PERSON> Amani </PERSON> said five civilians were killed and 11 were wounded in <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s official <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> news agency said in a dispatch from <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> that the cities of <LOCATION> Herat </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ghazni </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Khost </LOCATION> also came under heavy artillery fire from opposition forces and that four children in tose cities were killed. The figures could not be verified. <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION> is the guerrillas' first offensive since the Soviet pullout and would be the biggest city they have captured. If it falls, it would be a major blow to the morale of the government and a big boost to the rebels. The government has not provided a death toll from the <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION> fighting, but reports issued since it began add up to more than 2,600, with about 90 percent said to be guerrillas. The guerrillas give far lower numbers. In the letter to <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON>, <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Good </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Offices </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mission </ORGANIZATION> to <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, established to monitor the departure of Soviet troops from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, should take up duty on the border. <PERSON> Amani </PERSON> said the proposal was urgent because the mission's mandate expires Nov. 15. The force of 40 unarmed men from 10 nations does not have a mandate as a peacekeeping force. Its job since the Soviet pullout has been to take complaints from <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Islamabad </LOCATION> about alleged violations by the other side. The Soviet withdrawal was brought about by a U.N.-sponsored agreement signed in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> in April. As part of the accord, <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> agreed not to interfere in each other's internal affairs

 <PERSON> Gata </PERSON> <PERSON> Kamsky </PERSON>, the 14-year-old Soviet chess prodigy viewed as a possible future world champion, defected from his native land for the freedom to make choices about his chess career and his future, another Soviet defector said Wednesday. <PERSON> Kamsky </PERSON> and his father, <PERSON> Rustam </PERSON> <PERSON> Kamsky </PERSON>, were at federal immigration service offices in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>, going through the paperwork to gain asylum, said <PERSON> Lev </PERSON> <PERSON> Alburt </PERSON>, a chess grandmaster who defected from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> 10 years ago and since has won the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> championship. Alburt disclosed Tuesday that <PERSON> Kamsky </PERSON> and his father asked for asylum at the end of play Tuesday in the New York Open chess tournament at the Penta Hotel. He said the Kamskys were taken in tow by <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaufman </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chess </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>, and two <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents, one of whom was fluent in Russian. Neither of the Kamskys speaks English. Spokesmen for the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Immigration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Naturalization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> have not confirmed the defection, citing a policy of saying nothing about asylum cases for the protection of the defectors. The Soviet <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> ambassador, <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Belonogov </PERSON>, had no comment. Alburt, 43, said he had spoken to the Kamskys before they asked for asylum. `` The bottom line for virtually all defection is the people do n't want to stay in the huge prison that any Communist country is,'' he said. `` They want to be free, but in each case it may be a different kind of freedom. `` In their case, it was freedom to travel to chess tournaments, freedom to choose college, and so on.'' Young <PERSON> Kamsky </PERSON>, a two-time Soviet national junior champion, was heralded as a whiz kid last summer in a dispatch by <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION>, the official Soviet news agency. It described him as reading and writing at age 2 and being placed in the fourth grade when he started school. It said the father is a photographer and also coaches his son.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Pravda </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday that Soviet voters struck a blow for reform in legislative elections, which many official candidates lost, and three dates were announced for runoff contests. The newspaper said Sunday's election, the first in 70 years to give voters a choice, was a vote for the new policies of President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. `` Voters did not simply vote, like it was earlier, but they really made a choice, giving their preference to candidates whose pre-election platforms suited them better,'' Pravda said. `` Choosing people's deputies, the country voted for perestroika.'' The official news agency <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said candidates in 275 districts failed to win the majority needed for a seat in the new 2,250-member <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deputies </ORGANIZATION>. `` Elections will be held May 14 in 199 electoral districts in which neither of the two candidates running for parliament seats won the majority,'' it said. In 76 districts with three or more candidates, none of whom got a majority, runoffs will be held April 2 and April 9 between the top two candidates in each race, the agency said. Sunday's vote was for 1,500 of the parliament seats. The other 750 were filled by the party and official institutions without elections. Official results will not be released for several days, but the news reports Wednesday added details about the rejection of party and government officials. Those in the three largest cities _ <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kiev </LOCATION> _ felt the sting of a frustrated public, as did at least 37 top local officials around the country. Among the losers was <PERSON> Yuri </PERSON> <PERSON> Solovyev </PERSON>, a 59-year-old candidate member of the ruling Politburo who ran unopposed in <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION> but was kept from a majority by voters who crossed his name off the ballot. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> gave the first detailed report Wednesday on <PERSON> Solovyev </PERSON>'s failure and said 11 other government candidates also lost in 21 races It said <PERSON> Solovyev </PERSON> got 44 percent of the vote. <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> Khodyrev </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> his city's candidates lost because the public was poorly informed about their activity and voted on the basis of rumors and gossip The poor fortune of official candidates could help <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> by emphasizing public frustration over the leadership and the slow progress of reform. Reports from <LOCATION> Byelorussia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>, where citizen demands for reform have created problems for the party establishment, indicated the voters either rejected top official candidates or did not vote. Pravda said the losers included <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Galko </PERSON>, city party leader in <LOCATION> Minsk </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Byelorussian </LOCATION> capital, and a first deputy premier of the republic, <PERSON> Y. </PERSON> <PERSON> Khusainov </PERSON>. Voters also rejected party leaders in the southern <LOCATION> Gomel </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Mogilev </LOCATION> regions, which were affected by the 1986 <LOCATION> Chernobyl </LOCATION> nuclear disaster in the neighboring <LOCATION> Ukraine </LOCATION>. Many citizens of <LOCATION> Minsk </LOCATION> were angered last fall by tough police action against a new People's Front grassroots organization and groups seeking to build a memorial to victims of <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>'s purges. In <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>, voters stayed home to express frustration over a lack of choice, the government newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Izvestia </ORGANIZATION> reported. `` At the very climax of the campaign, people asked a question for which they did not receive a convincing answer,'' the newspaper said. `` Why did a group of leaders of the republic, nominated as candidates, have no opponents?,'' it said, and added: `` Many, as a sign of protest, refused to take part in elections without a choice.'' In many parts of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> 85 percent to 95 percent of voters participated, but in <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> the figure was 71.9. Only 53 percent voted in <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION>, capital of the republic. Pravda said losers in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Far </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> included the party leaders in <LOCATION> Khabarovsk </LOCATION> region and the <LOCATION> Birobidzhan </LOCATION> Jewish autonomous region, the regional party leader in <LOCATION> Chita </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Siberia </LOCATION>, and the leader in the Tuymen oil-producing region of northwestern <LOCATION> Siberia </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>New Law Would Bar Police From Pretending to be Reporters</HEAD>

<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A legislator Wednesday introduced a bill that would make it illegal for police to impersonate journalists while entering Arab villages to make arrests. The proposal comes amid a dispute between reporters and the police after two reported instances last week in which plainclothes policemen were seen with `` Press'' or `` TV'' signs in the windows of their unmarked cars. Reporters usually put the signs in the windows to prevent protesters from throwing rocks or firebombs on their vehicles while covering the Palestinian uprising in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. Parliamentarian <PERSON> Avraham </PERSON> <PERSON> Poraz </PERSON>, a member of the liberal <ORGANIZATION> Shinui </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> who proposed the bill, said the policemen's camouflage practice could harm freedom of the press in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, curtailing the usually outspoken media. `` It's important for journalists to be everywhere and have access to information,'' he said. `` People come to journalists and tell them all kinds of things. If they start thinking the journalist is really a policeman, they wo n't talk ... and that could damage freedom of the press,'' <PERSON> Poraz </PERSON> said. After last week's incidents involving police masquerading as reporters, Police Inspector-General <PERSON> Krauss </PERSON> said the practice was legal and would continue. But when <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> journalists and foreign correspondents protested, he agreed to limit the practice, requiring his personal permission for using the tactic. The English-language <ORGANIZATION> Jerusalem </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> criticized <PERSON> Krauss </PERSON>' position in an editorial Wednesday. `` What the police inspector-general has sanctioned, in principle, is the delegitimization of the press in its role as observer of the Palestinian uprising,'' the newspaper said. `` That this should be allowed in a democratic society is inconceivable.'' <PERSON> Roni </PERSON> <PERSON> Shaked </PERSON>, head of a committee of journalists who cover the territories, also argued the police practice endangers reporters. `` The security forces and police defend themselves with weapons and steel helmets, and we have only our pens and the ` Press' signs,'' he said Palestinian youths regularly stone cars with yellow Israeli license plates, but they sometimes spare cars with `` Press'' signs. Reporters frequently have complained that <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> security agents and police masqueraded as journalists to move about the occupied territories and make arrests. Authorities have denied the tactic was used, but the issue came to a head last week when a British TV crew filmed the two police with the `` TV'' sign on their car, then watched them arrest a teen-age Palestinian girl. The idea also has apparently caught on among followers of the anti-Arab former legislator, Rabbi <PERSON> Meir </PERSON> <PERSON> Kahane </PERSON>, who placed a `` Press'' sign in the window of their van, according to a photograph in the <ORGANIZATION> Yediot </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ahronot </ORGANIZATION> newspaper. In introducing his bill, <PERSON> Poraz </PERSON> noted that while impersonating doctors or lawyers is illegal, no such protection exists for journalists. His bill makes an exception for national security cases, but even then a court's permission would be required.

<TEXT>
 A 31-story high-rise that sparked a three-year fight between activists and a developer must have its top 12 floors razed to comply with local law, a city agency has ruled. The Board of Standards and Appeals unanimously rejected arguments by <ORGANIZATION> Parkview </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION> that its <LOCATION> Upper </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Side </LOCATION> building receive a variance allowing it to override zoning laws. <ORGANIZATION> Parkview </ORGANIZATION>'s attorney, <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Segal </PERSON>, said Wednesday the firm would not decide for at least a week whether to appeal Tuesday's decision in the state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. The firm has 30 days in which to appeal. <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> is <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> state's trial-level court. <ORGANIZATION> Parkview </ORGANIZATION>, which has said it stands to lose $ 10 million by dismantling the fought-over floors, had taken the fight to the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> last year to avoid lopping off the 12 stories it had topped off in 1986. Activists, who began the fight against the building, hailed the decision as a warning to developers in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>. `` This is a very strong message: zoning is not for sale. No more indulging developers,'' said <PERSON> Genie </PERSON> <PERSON> Rice </PERSON>, president of the neighborhood group <ORGANIZATION> Civitas </ORGANIZATION>. `` You ca n't decide to go ahead with a project and then buy your way out.'' <ORGANIZATION> Parkview </ORGANIZATION> had continued work on the building for two months in the summer of 1986 while its permit was reviewed. The builder had offered to build about 40 low-income senior citizen apartments in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harlem </LOCATION> in return for a zoning variance leaving the building intact. The fight over the building began when Ms. <PERSON> Rice </PERSON> discovered the building had been constructed in violation of local zoning laws setting the limit for new buildings at 19 stories. <ORGANIZATION> Parkview </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION> bought the site in 1982 and received a construction permit for 31 stories in 1985 when city officials misinterpreted a zoning map. When the case went into the courts, the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> state <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> ruled the original permit was invalid and that the building owner must share in the blame. `` Reasonable diligence'' by <LOCATION> Parkview </LOCATION> would have discovered the correct zoning, the court ruled. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, without comment, left that ruling intact. If <ORGANIZATION> Parkview </ORGANIZATION> is unable to overturn the board's ruling, the process for dismantling the extra floors would be the same used for tearing down old buildings. Protective scaffolding is placed outside the building, with workers going from the top down prying off the brick facing, breaking the concrete floor into movable chunks and torching through metalwork.

 After <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> resoundingly rejected a 51 percent pay raise last month, <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> was asked if the issue would surface again. `` I hope not real soon,'' he said. `` I can count.'' Seven weeks later, <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> and his colleagues are being asked to count again. Most seem unwilling to do that. `` Will something get done this year? I doubt it,'' House Majority Whip <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON>, D-Calif., said Wednesday `` Something needs to be done but I'm not at all optimistic. And next year is an election year; it's even worse.'' <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON>, the Democrats' chief vote counter, was reacting to a new raise proposal by a commission that studied the salaries of members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, federal judges and senior government executives. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> welcomed the recommendations and said he would soon offer specific proposals to the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. The commission, headed by former <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Volcker </PERSON>, proposed raises of approximately 50 percent over two years, not much different than the package killed last month after a firestorm of citizen opposition. Rank-and-file members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> now are paid $ 89,500 a year; a 50 percent raise would boost congressional salaries to $ 135,000. Capitol Hill's initial reaction could best be summed up as `` thanks but no thanks.'' Hardly a surprise, given the events of late January and early February, following a proposal that congressional salaries be raised by 51 percent. Opponents, notably radio talk show hosts, took little note of the fact that the package also covered judges and managers of many of the government's most important and sensitive programs. The nation's anger was directed at <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. The talk show hosts and their callers portrayed the lawmakers as greedy do-nothings. Angry constituents flooded the Capitol mail room with letters and tea bags to protest. Polls showed overwhelming public opposition to the raises, which were due to take effect automatically. Facing all that, <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> decided the pay plan should go to a vote. The outcome was as inevitable as death and taxes. Afterward, <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said it was time to move on. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> seemed to concur. `` What you do n't want to do is come in and when the wounded are still lying on the battlefield start fighting another battle,'' he said then. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> apparently believes now that the wounds have already healed. <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s leadership is vital to any hopes of passing pay raises for members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, federal judges and government executives. But he quickly added that the president would have to get Republicans in line before the Democratic leadership would embrace a new pay plan. `` Everybody does their own thing around here instead of doing what is in the best interests of the institution,'' <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON> said. `` You can get a lot of mileage out of opposing pay hikes if you're thinking about running for the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> from <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>. That was a shot at Rep. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Tauke </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Iowa </LOCATION>, a leading opponent of the pay raises voted down last month. <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON> did n't say it, but hopes of winning a pay raise could rest on getting <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Nader </PERSON> in line too. <PERSON> Nader </PERSON> led the talk show assault on the last pay raise package and was quick to criticize the new one. `` President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> should apply his flexible freeze philosophy to the salaries of top government officials,'' the self-styled consumer advocate said. <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON>, asked if any new attempt at pay raises would likely meet the same fate as the last, replied: `` Sure. The Ralph Naders and the talk show hosts will prevail,'' It's not that a majority of the lawmakers do n't think they deserve a hefty raise. Rep. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Rostenkowski </PERSON>, D-Ill., drew a standing ovation last month when he insisted, `` Each member of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Democrat </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION>, is worth $ 135,000. The question now is whether enough of the lawmakers think it's worth trying again to convince the American public of that <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON> doubts it. `` I count the votes and I do n't count enough of them on either side of the aisle,'' he said. `` We have a tendency to shoot ourselves in the foot. We certainly have on this one.''

<HEAD>Scientists See Little Chance to Regain Contact with Mars Probe</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH G. SEWARD</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
 Officials worked around the clock Wednesday to restore contact with a space probe circling the <LOCATION> Martian </LOCATION> moon <PERSON> Phobos </PERSON>, but hopes were fading that they could save the $ 500 million project. A commission has been formed to determine the cause of the failure of Phobos II and present its conclusions in a week, said <PERSON> Sergei </PERSON> <PERSON> Zavgorodny </PERSON>, an official at Glavkosmos, the Soviet space agency. In an interview with the newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Izvestia </ORGANIZATION>, Glavkosmos head <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Dunayev </PERSON> said scientists were awaiting the commission's findings before taking further action Scientists at <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, which developed the project to explore Mars and Phobos, its biggest moon, met throughout the day Wednesday. One expert emerged and gave a gloomy assessment of the future of the spacecraft, whose companion probe Phobos I became lost in space in September after a ground controller sent an erroneous computer command. `` The situation is bad and honestly, there are fewer and fewer hopes. Chances to regain contact with the probe are very small,'' said <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Zakharov </PERSON>, a project scientist. A Soviet TV commentator suggested that Western news reports claiming the problem was `` catastrophic'' were exagerrated and cited successful studies by the craft of solar radiation and the surface of Mars itself conducted before the communication failure. The report on the evening news program `` Vremya'' featured detailed maps of the Martian surface compiled photos taken by the spacecraft. Ground control has received sporadic radio signals from the spacecraft, an unmanned spacecraft launched in July, but no regular contact, he said. <ORGANIZATION> Izvestia </ORGANIZATION> said the problem occurred Monday when ground controllers were trying to reorient the spacecraft to take photographs of the Martian moon. After the maneuver, it said, controllers were unable to contact the craft despite repeated attempts. <PERSON> Dunayev </PERSON> said there were seven or eight possibilities as to why communications failed. He did not elaborate, and efforts to reach him were unsuccessful. Loss of Phobos II would be a severe setback for the $ 480 million international Phobos project led by the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. Twenty-two countries and the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> have contributed technology or experiments to the project, and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was helping track the two craft with <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION>'s Deep Space Network. Loss of communications apparently would prevent Phobos II from dropping two small landing craft onto the surface of the Martian moon. Soviet news reports in January said the spacecraft was to approach the moon next month to analyze its soil with a laser and then release two landers. <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Bonnet </PERSON>, science director of the Paris-based <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, said `` there is some hope'' of regaining contact with Phobos II. `` It's not zero,'' he added in an interview. `` It's a disappointment. But the Mars phase was a great success. We obtained unique information on the surface of Mars, its atmosphere, its magnetic field and its environment,'' <PERSON> Bonnet </PERSON> said. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Vincent </PERSON> said the Soviets had not asked the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for help but that the agency's tracking network is monitoring the craft. `` There is nothing we can do for them,'' he said. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> announced Jan. 30 that Phobos II went into orbit around <LOCATION> Mars </LOCATION> the previous day after a six-month, 111 million-mile voyage from <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> and was studying the planet's climate and soil. Soviet space officials have said the mission would help them prepare a manned mission to <LOCATION> Mars </LOCATION> early in the 21st century. Phobos II was launched July 12 in a program to unlock mysteries of the red planet and Phobos, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. In December, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said some instruments aboard Phobos II failed, but most were fixed and the problems would not prevent the completion of its program. Phobos I was lost only three months after it was launched July 7, and ground controllers have been unable to communicate with it.

In one village, an ethnic Albanian police officer was laid to rest in an unmarked grave after a procession where the only women allowed to be present were the victim's mother, wife and daughter. In another village, a <LOCATION> Serbian </LOCATION> officer was buried by a priest following a church service attended by thousands of men and women. The only things the services shared were a deep sense of mourning and a large police detail that frisked those attending for concealed weapons. `` Perhaps the killing of an ethnic <PERSON> Albanian </PERSON> and a Serb will serve to sober nationalist passions that have erupted in our land,'' said a policeman guarding one of the funerals. He refused to give his name. Officer <PERSON> Jetulah </PERSON> <PERSON> Kuchi </PERSON>, an ethnic <PERSON> Albanian </PERSON>, and officer <PERSON> Miroljub </PERSON> <PERSON> Tanaskovic </PERSON>, a Serb, both died of gunshot wounds suffered during clashes earlier this week between ethnic Albanians and police. <PERSON> Kuchi </PERSON>, 31, a father of four and the commander of the police station in <LOCATION> Podujevo </LOCATION>, was buried in <LOCATION> Suva </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Reka </LOCATION> village in a Moslem funeral. Most of the 200 mourners were ethnic Albanian men, wearing traditional dome-shaped white hats and filing past his photograph moments before the coffin was lowered into an unmarked grave _ in keeping with Moslem customs. His mother, wife, and daughters were the only females allowed to accompany the coffin, while other women relatives remained at home, weeping loudly. Albanian men and boys lined the narrow, winding, unpaved streets leading to the Moslem cemetery in <LOCATION> Suva </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Reka </LOCATION>, 40 miles south of <LOCATION> Pristina </LOCATION>, as policemen carried the coffin on its last journey. Patrolman <PERSON> Tanaskovic </PERSON> was laid to rest hours later in a different cemetery in accordance with the rites of the Serbian Orthodox church. At least 5,000 Serbian men and women gathered around the yellow-and-orange striped Orthodox church in <LOCATION> Preoce </LOCATION>, six miles south of <LOCATION> Pristina </LOCATION>, to pay their last respects to <PERSON> Tanaskovic </PERSON>. The 34-year-old patrolman, married with one child, reportedly died when a sniper shot him in the town of <LOCATION> Titova </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mitrovica </LOCATION>. A bearded Orthodox priest conducted part of the burial ceremony. People attending both funerals were frisked. In <LOCATION> Suva </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Reka </LOCATION>, at least five Soviet-built T-55 stood guard to prevent further demonstrations. At least 23 people were killed this week in clashes in <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION> province after the legislature in <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION>, which is part of <LOCATION> Serbia </LOCATION>, approved constitutional changes giving <LOCATION> Serbia </LOCATION> more control over the province. Serbs said the changes were needed to protect them from persecution at the hands of the ethnic Albanians, who are in the majority. Ethnic Albanians said the changes robbed them of autonomy they won in a 1974 constitution.

 Syrian forces blasted <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s Christian enclave with rocket fire Wednesday, ignoring a cease-fire called by the army commander. The main Christian militia threatened to strike back with `` double cruelty.'' `` We are adhering to the truce despite the random Syrian shelling that has targeted even hospitals,'' the army commander, Gen. <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>, told a news conference. `` But our patience has limits.'' <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> Syrian </LOCATION> leadership was `` acting in a terrorist way,'' and he said he would complain to the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION>. Salvos fired from multibarreled rocket launchers thundered over the <LOCATION> Lebanese </LOCATION> capital all day, despite the truce <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> proclaimed at midnight in response to an Arab League appeal. The shelling intensified at nightfall. `` We warn the aggressors who are entrenched inside residential districts against this massive escalation,'' said the Lebanese Forces, the Christians' main militia. `` If it continues, we will be compelled to retaliate with double cruelty to stop these criminal practices.'' Police said two people were killed and 16 others were wounded in the Syrian bombardment of east <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. Since the fighting began March 8, 123 people have died and 388 have been injured. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> said ambassador <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON>'s residence in the Christian suburb of <LOCATION> Yarze </LOCATION> was struck by a Syrian shell Tuesday night, damaging the living quarters but causing no casualties. An embassy spokeswoman said <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON> was in the bomb shelter at the time. Col. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Shidiak </PERSON>, who commands a police unit protecting diplomats, said the Belgian and Turkish embassies near the presidential palace in suburban <LOCATION> Baabda </LOCATION> and the residence of <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> ambassador <PERSON> Alann </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramsay </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Rabieh </LOCATION> also were hit by Syrian rockets this week. No casualties were reported. A communique by <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s headquarters said the latest bombardment caught residents of east <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> as they were emerging from shelters to buy food and take stock of the damage from six straight nights of attacks. Militiamen in <LOCATION> Shweifat </LOCATION>, just south of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, from where Syrians and allied Druse fighters have been firing into the Christian heartland, appeared disgruntled. `` We do not like to kill our Lebanese brethren,'' said a fighter with Druse warlord <PERSON> Walid </PERSON> <PERSON> Jumblatt </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Progressive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, who identified himself only as <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Antar </PERSON>. `` We do n't like this dirty war. Civilians are dying on both sides,'' he said. `` The fighting can last for as long as we and they have ammunition.'' Police said at least 250,000 people have fled west and south <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> in recent days. The shelling has damaged power plants, leaving some areas in total darkness and others with only a few hours of electricity a day. The fighting began after <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> clamped a blockade on illegal ports operated by Moslem militias. These facilities have been depriving the government of an estimated $ 100 million a year in tax revenues. <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> keeps about 40,000 troops in northern and eastern provinces as well as Moslem west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> under a 1976 Arab League mandate to end the 14-year-old civil war. Christian leaders say <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> can no longer play the role of a neutral peacekeeper because of its bias toward Moslems. The Moslem-Christian rift deepened six months ago when President <PERSON> Amin </PERSON> <PERSON> Gemayel </PERSON>'s six-year term expired and <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> was unable to elect a successor. Before he stepped down on Sept. 22, <PERSON> Gemayel </PERSON> named <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> head of an interim military cabinet Moslems and <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> rejected the appointment.

 Democrats rejoiced Wednesday over <PERSON> Jill </PERSON> <PERSON> Long </PERSON>'s surprise victory in a normally <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> congressional district in <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> while both political parties turned their attention to elections next month in <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> Neither Democrats nor Republicans claimed any important national trend in Tuesday's returns from <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, in which Long defeated Republican <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Heath </PERSON> by about 1,700 votes to capture the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> seat once held by Vice President <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>. But <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> said he was `` ashamed'' at the loss of the seat that had been a safe one for the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION>, and conceded that the race looked `` very tough'' next week in a heavily Democratic region of <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>. Other Republicans insisted their candidate was an underdog in the <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> race, even though the seat has been in <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> hands for a decade. Democratic spokesman <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> McCurry </PERSON> said his side holds the upper hand going into the final week of the <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> campaign. He said if <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> is ashamed of the outcome of the <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> race, he'd be `` apoplectic'' if the Democrats followed up with wins in <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>. In strict numerical terms, the outcome of the three races will make scant difference in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, where the Democratic majority will stand at 259-174 when Long is sworn in next week. But that did n't stop the party professionals from scrutinizing the <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> returns or vying for public relations advantage in the two elections to come. `` It's hard to read this as a referendum on <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> but on the other hand absent a strong national Republican agenda, these local candidates do n't have much to stand on,'' <PERSON> McCurry </PERSON> said. `` Obviously, we regret the loss,'' said <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>. He said that the race `` reflected a lot of local issues. ... But I do n't think we would read much more into it.'' Long, who received congratulations from <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> in a telephone call, told reporters the contest was `` just a race between two individuals in northeast <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>.'' Long, a 36-year-old business professor who had twice been defeated in congressional campaigns, will take the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> seat given up by Republican <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Coats </PERSON>, who was appointed to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> after <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> was elected vice president. <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>'s election next Tuesday pits Democrat <PERSON> Glen </PERSON> <PERSON> Browder </PERSON> against Republican <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Rice </PERSON> to fill the seat vacated by the death of longtime Democratic Rep. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Nichols </PERSON>. The <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> election April 26 is to choose between Democrat <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Vinich </PERSON> and Republican <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> to succeed <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON>, who resigned from <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> when he was confirmed as defense secretary. Republicans have won five of the last six presidential elections, but `` have n't figured out how to translate national strength into state and local strength,'' said <PERSON> McCurry </PERSON>, spokesman at the <ORGANIZATION> DNC </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> used personal campaigning by <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, Coats and <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in an unsuccessful effort to hold the <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> seat, and <PERSON> Heath </PERSON> aired a television commercial featuring the president. But several Republicans said <PERSON> Long </PERSON> was successful because she was better known to the voters, ran an aggressive campaign and capitalized on key local issues _ particularly her complaints about a local tax increase. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> is not going to regain control of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> by running against -LRB- House Speaker -RRB- <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> and injecting <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> into every race,'' said <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Helmke </PERSON>, a Republican consultant with longtime ties to <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> said, `` I have no excuses. We should have won that race. I am very surprised we lost it.'' <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> added that `` we did n't have the best candidate. We did n't run the best campaign and on some issues, we got snookered.'' <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Buckley </PERSON>, spokesman at the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Campaign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said the result in <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> and the possiblity of a follow-up Democratic triumph in <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> `` puts more visibility on <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>.'' He said his organization would spend the maximum allowed by law _ $ 104,000 _ on the race there, and claimed the underdog's role for <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Vinich </PERSON> narrowly lost a bid to defeat Sen. <PERSON> Malcolm </PERSON> <PERSON> Wallop </PERSON> in November and is better known to the voters, he said. As for <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>, `` we have a very tough row to hoe,'' and he noted that 70,000 votes were cast in the Democratic primary to pick a general election candidate and only about 18,000 in the Republican primary. At the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Campaign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, Rep. <PERSON> Beryl </PERSON> <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION> issued a statement recommending that Republicans spend more time protecting their own seats than `` wasting time with their grandiose plans to target Democrats they have no chance to win.'' That was a reference to a recent declaration by <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> campaign boss <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Rollins </PERSON> that <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> would be a major target of Republican efforts in 1990.

<HEAD>Courts Allows Unemployment Pay for People Shunning Sabbath Work</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 States may not deny unemployment benefits to people who refuse to work on their Sabbath _ even if the refusal is not based on a religious sect's doctrine, the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday. The court ruled unanimously that <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> officials violated a <LOCATION> Peoria </LOCATION> man's religious freedom when denying him unemployment benefits. `` I'm thrilled,'' said <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Frazee </PERSON> after learning of his legal victory. `` I am thankful for the Lord's faithfulness.'' In a series of previous decisions, the justices had barred states from denying unemployment benefits to people who refuse certain work because of religious scruples. But in all previous cases, the workers' refusal was based on the teachings of an established religious group such as the Seventh-day Adventists or the <PERSON> Jehovah </PERSON>'s Witnesses. Writing for the court Wednesday, Justice <PERSON> Byron </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON> said the court's previous rulings never suggested that people who refrain from work because of religious scruples are ineligible for unemployment benefits unless they belong to a religious group that forbids such work. The ruling means, for example, that a Methodist or Roman Catholic might be eligible for unemployment benefits after refusing to work on Sunday even though neither church bars work on the Sabbath as part of its official doctrine. <PERSON> Frazee </PERSON> was disqualified from receiving unemployment benefits after turning down a temporary job assignment in 1984 that would have required him to work on Sunday. <PERSON> Frazee </PERSON> said his understanding of the requirements and tenets of Christianity is that non-emergency work on Sundays is forbidden. The <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Employment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> ruled that <PERSON> Frazee </PERSON>'s rejection of the job offer disqualified him from receiving unemployment benefits. State officials, while not questioning <PERSON> Frazee </PERSON>'s sincerity, said a refusal to work due to religious scruples must be based `` on some tenet or dogma accepted by the individual of some church, sect or denomination'' _ and not based merely on personal religious convictions. <PERSON> Frazee </PERSON> sued, and <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> courts ruled against him. But the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> said the state courts were wrong. White rejected arguments by state officials that a victory for <PERSON> Frazee </PERSON> would lead to Americans seeking Sundays off because they want to shop, play sports or even watch football on television. `` We are unpersuaded that there will be a mass movement away from Sunday employ if <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Frazee </PERSON> succeeds in his claim,'' <PERSON> White </PERSON> said. Ironically, <PERSON> Frazee </PERSON> now is employed with the <ORGANIZATION> state </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Employment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION>. He said he still opposes Sunday work `` unless one is involved in an essential service.'' `` If I were a doctor, ambulance driver or the like I would have no qualms but those jobs preserve and protect life,'' he said. In other decisions, the court: _ Ruled in an <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> case that state, not federal, courts have the initial authority to rule on a state's efforts to tax bingo games and cigarette sales conducted by Indians outside a reservation _ Ordered a federal appeals court to restudy the case of convicted a <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> murderer who is seeking to overturn his death sentence for a 1974 killing

<HEAD>This Tape Will Self-Destruct</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANTHONY MARQUEZ</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Reminiscent of the `` Mission Impossible'' television series, a major film company plans to test-market a videocassette that will self-destruct after the movie has been watched a et number of times. <ORGANIZATION> MGM-UA </ORGANIZATION> Home Video has decided to test the `` disposable'' tapes this summer in an undisclosed city, according to <PERSON> Herb </PERSON> <PERSON> Fischer </PERSON>, vice president of sales and marketing. The mission of the new videocassette _ should studios decide to accept it _ will be to encourage the production companies to sell video rental stores more copies of a movie for the same price they would pay for tapes with unlimited play. That would make it easier for movie renters nationwide to find a hot new release at their video stores. `` It saves you going back three times to get the same film,'' said <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON>, president of the Los Angeles-based <ORGANIZATION> S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Roberts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co </ORGANIZATION>. The company is consulting on the project for <ORGANIZATION> Rank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Video </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>, a manufacturing duplicating company based in <LOCATION> Torrance </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, that licensed the patent to the new product. Although these tapes will not go up in smoke when the limited number of plays are completed, they will erase themselves and can not then be re-recorded, said <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON>. `` It becomes inoperative as a normal cassette,'' said <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Pfannkuch </PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Rank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Video </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>. He said the technology for this type of videocassette has been around for three to five years. However, it will be the first test-marketing of this type of tape that could have a profound influence in the $ 8 billion videocassette industry. The first title has not yet been selected. Introduction of the new tapes, which will have green cases to distinguish them from the typical black cases, could meet strong initial demand for popular movies, said <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON>. He said retailers lose from 5-20 percent of their potential business because frustrated customers who can not find their first-choice movie leave without renting anything. A retail outlet currently pays more than $ 60 for a movie title and can not afford to stock it in depth. However, with the disposable tapes programmed at 20 plays, that retailer could buy the same movie for about $ 30, he said. `` The goal of this is not to replace the traditional black tapes,'' said <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON>, who explained that retailers would still buy the permanent tapes but would also purchase the green disposable movies for `` depth of copy.'' However, the head of a nationwide organization of independent video retailers said the reported problem of overwhelming demand for popular movies has been overstated. `` Our consumer surveys show that customers are generally happy and that 60 to 70 percent of the time they get their tape,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Power </PERSON>, president of the non-profit, 2,500-member <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Video </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION> Chandler </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ariz. </LOCATION> `` The disposable tape in theory is being promoted in a way that could sound attractive to retailers,'' <PERSON> Power </PERSON> said Wednesday. But retailers are concerned that marketers could eventually decide to make all their videocassettes disposable, something his organization would find intolerable, <PERSON> Power </PERSON> said. The price of the disposable tapes will be set as they are passed along from studios to wholesalers and finally to retailers. <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> said rental fees probably will not be affected, but customers will have to be more cautious about rewinding. The disposable tapes can be rewound up to 20 minutes into the movie without triggering the counter that marks the number of plays. After that, any rewinding would count as a play, said <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON>. None of the principals involved would reveal any other specifics of the technology involved in the disposable tapes, other than to explain that the movies would be preset to play a number of times ranging from 15 to 60.

 The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration has asked <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> for a $ 1.1 billion supplemental appropriation for the <ORGANIZATION> Veterans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> for the current fiscal year, the department announced Wednesday. Some of the money already had been announced by members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, including a $ 303 million request for the department's medical care arm Officials said last fall that the more than $ 10 billion allocated in the regular appropriation was not going to be enough to maintain care for veterans whose income is enough to put them at the end of the line for care in the 172 hospitals of the veterans' system At the time, the shortfall was estimated at $ 600 million to $ 1 billion. The department has been raiding supply and equipment accounts to pay salaries while the administration decided how much money to seek. Approval of the $ 303 million will end those bookkeeping raids, the department said. Of the balance of the request, $ 701 million is for increased pension and other benefit payments to meet the 4.1 percent increase mandated by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> effective Dec. 1. Such a supplemental appropriation is an annual routine. Some $ 22 million of the increase would be allocated to readjustment programs and $ 130 million to loan guarantee programs. Secretary <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Derwinski </PERSON> said he expected `` swift approval'' of the request, which would bring his department's spending this year to $ 29.2 billion

<HEAD>US Wants Contras to Return Home to Do Political Battle with Sandinistas</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> acknowledged Wednesday that it is encouraging leaders of the Nicaraguan Contras to return to their homeland and do battle with the leftist <ORGANIZATION> Sandinista </ORGANIZATION> government in the political, rather than military, arena. Department spokeswoman <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON> said the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration `` supports the willingness of individual resistance leaders, or the leadership as a whole, to voluntarily return to <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> to participate in the political process.'' She said `` it is important to test the Nicaraguan government's intention'' to carry out its promises of democratization, and called on `` the international community'' to `` lend its full support and protection'' to those who return by monitoring their treatment inside <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> A five-nation regional peace agreement calls for political reforms inside <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> leading to a free and open campaign and national elections in February 1990, and one of the seven Contra political directors said he and three colleagues are likely to accept that challenge. `` We need a unified candidacy'' to mount an effective opposition to the ruling leftist <ORGANIZATION> Sandinista </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> party </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Cesar </PERSON>, a member of the Nicaraguan Resistance political directorate. <PERSON> Cesar </PERSON> said he would return to <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> in May if promised changes in election and communications law are accomplished and if the presidents of the five Central American countries come up with a suitable plan for eventual repatriation of Contra fighters. He said he would not himself seek election, but would work to bring together the many political parties in the splintered opposition behind a candidate who can bridge the broad spectrum of political beliefs in the country. `` We need someone who is above politics,'' he said, but declined to name who might fit that description. And he said, based on private conversations with other members of the directorate, three others in the Contra political leadership also were likely to return and involve themselves in the campaign leading to national elections next February. The other three probably will not go back, he said. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration, seeking to implement a new bipartisan policy approach to <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> worked out with <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> last week, is pressing the rebel leaders to return to <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> and is cutting by at least half the money the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> now spends to support the rebels' political activities in exile. <PERSON> Cesar </PERSON> said that means <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> support will drop from $ 400,000 a month to about $ 200,000, necessitating the laying off of employees and the possible closing of some offices. White House spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> confirmed the new policy direction Wednesday, saying, `` We'd like to see the focus go now to the political and diplomatic affairs of <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. ... We would like to see the leadership integrated back into the political society there.'' As a further step toward translating the new policy into action, President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will meet at the White House next week with Costa Rican President <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> <PERSON> Arias </PERSON>, the author of a regional peace accord, said <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>. <PERSON> Arias </PERSON>, who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1987 for his efforts, will stop in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> en route to <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> to discuss the status of the regional peace process and how the new administration policy fits in. In addition, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> plans to meet in the next few weeks with <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON>, the president-elect of <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> who won election last week as the candidate of the rightist <PERSON> Arena </PERSON> party, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. Under the new policy, the Contras are being urged to join the internal political opposition in their country and become contenders in next year's elections. `` Even though it's only at the suggestion level, it's a very strong suggestion,'' <PERSON> Cesar </PERSON> said in a telephone interview. `` The message is that they will no longer support political activities in exile. The only ones they will support are ones conducted inside <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> as part of the political opposition there.'' <PERSON> Cesar </PERSON> said that message was delivered to the rebels at a <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> meeting when the seven members of the directorate were in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> two weeks ago. It was repeated in stronger terms when a <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> delegation traveled to <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> to meet again with the group last Friday _ at the same time <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was announcing a new policy toward <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> at the White House. `` The whole idea behind that is that political activity should be transferred inside <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, which is where the testing arena is now'' said <PERSON> Cesar </PERSON>. The new policy, arrived at after weeks of meetings with congressional leaders, calls for a 10-month renewal of humanitarian aid to the rebels troops now based in border camps just inside neighboring <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>. But it also commits the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to support a peace process undertaken by the five countries in the region and permits the rebel aid to be used to relocate the fighters into their homeland when political conditions there improve.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said Wednesday that parents do n't deserve a tax break for paying tuition to send their children to private schools. `` Ca n't afford to do that,'' he said. `` Everybody should support the public school system and then, if on top of that, your parents think that they want to shell out in addition to the tax money, tuition money, that's their right,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told a student group. `` But I do n't think they should get a break for that.'' He said `` it is the obligation of all taxpayers to support a public education system.'' The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration had supported the idea of tuition tax credits for parents who send their children to private schools, but dropped the idea in a major overhaul of the tax system. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> made his comments in a question and answer session with 75 students spending a week in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> as part of a program to give youths an inside look at government. The program is sponsored by Close Up, a non-partisan, educational foundation. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Thill </PERSON>, a student at the <ORGANIZATION> Hawaii </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Preparatory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION>, told <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> that his parents pay his tuition but also have to pay taxes for public education, and asked whether they should get a tax break. `` No, no they should n't,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> replied. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he wanted the public education system `` to be the best, and I think in many ways it is the best, although I am disturbed when I see some kids underachieving, not being able to identify where the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is on the globe or something of that nature.'' He said he had been intrigued by the concept of tuition tax credits for private institutions including parochial schools. However, he said, `` ca n't afford to do that'' because of the big budget deficit. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also said that the federal government should not be the `` final arbiter'' on educational matters, insisting that role should be filled by states and local communities. On another subject, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who has said he wants to wipe out illiteracy within eight years, said, `` I do n't think the federal government can eliminate it.'' He said it will require resources beyond government, including help from corporations and others.

 The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> on Wednesday welcomed a call by the Arab League for a cease-fire in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> and urged all warring groups to comply. `` We strongly support that call, and we share the <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION>'s concern about the grave situation in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>,'' said a <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> statement `` The shelling must stop and the land and sea blockades must end. Syrian gunners and their Druse allies have been trading artillery fire with Christian army units in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> since March 8 in the worst sectarian fighting the country has known in four years. The Christians, headed by Gen. <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>, have blockaded southern ports used by Moslem militias, and the Moslems have retaliated with a counter-blockade of the Christian enclave in the north. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> views the lifting of the blockades as vital to restoring some calm to <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> so the sides can negotiate a cease-fire. `` All parties to the fighting must negotiate their differences with one another.

The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> statement reiterated <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> willingness `` to assist'' the <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION>'s peace initiative `` however we can.'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials say assistance would be in the form of using what influence the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has to get the warring parties to talk to each other. `` We ca n't do it for them,'' said one official. `` We can push them to get into the same room, we can urge them, but we ca n't solve their problem,'' he said, speaking on condition of anonymity The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is also consulting with other countries who wield some influence on <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> and on the Lebanese Christians, he said.

<HEAD>A Slowdown in Fish Farming</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The rapid growth of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aquaculture that began a decade ago slowed in 1988, largely because of less expansion in the catfish industry, the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday. Overall, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> production of edible and non-edible aquaculture products increased only 40 million pounds last year, compared with a 1987 growth of more than 100 million pounds, the department's <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said in a preliminary report `` Slower growth in the catfish industry, which accounts for about 45 percent of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aquaculture production, was principally responsible for the less rapid total expansion,'' the report said. The slowdown in catfish was partly offset by stronger growth in some other aquaculture products such as salmon, tilapia and striped bass. Despite the throttling back in catfish production, total 1988 output grew 5.2 percent to a record 295 millon pounds, the report said. Catfish growth was more than 32 percent in 1987 and 11 percent in 1986. Catfish production was accompanied by a 23.6 percent increase in prices paid farmers by processors in 1988. Those price averages ranged from $ 1.61 per pound in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> to 71 cents in <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>. `` However, higher feed and energy costs led to a 20 percent to 25 percent increase in production costs, which meant that net returns -LRB- to farmers -RRB- were only 5 percent to 10 percent higher,'' the report said. Trout producers surveyed by the agency sold 58.9 million pounds with a value of $ 63.6 million between Sept. 1, 1987, and Aug. 31, 1988, the report said. Producers also sold more than 361 million trout eggs worth $ 2.8 million. Production of pen-raised salmon was estimated at six million pounds in 1988, a 70 percent increase from 1987. The report said domestic salmon production `` will probably continue to see large gains'' in the next few years. Imports of fish and shellfish products last year were estimated at $ 4.5 billion, down from $ 5.4 billion in 1987. `` This marks the first decline in the value of imported fishery products in six years,'' the report said. `` At the same time, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> exports of fishery products have increased from $ 1.5 billion to $ 2 billion.'' The higher export value resulted from the decline in the value of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar overseas, making <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> products less expensive in foreign markets, the report said.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> is planning to spend $ 186 million on rebuilding its headquarters, a spokesman said Wednesday. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Brannigan </PERSON> of the bank's information staff said he hopes work can start by the end of this year to remodel the headquarters. One of the four buildings to be replaced dates back to 1941. The bank's main entrance faces the main building of its sister organization, the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monetary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION>. They are just below <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Avenue </LOCATION> on 19th Street, three blocks west of the White House. The bank plans eventually to put 1,900 permanent employees to its new buildings from offices it now rents elsewhere in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, in addition to the 3,000 workers in the old ones. When the six-year project is completed, it will save $ 30 million a year on rent, <PERSON> Brannigan </PERSON> added. He eplained the job will be done slowly to disrupt the bank's work as little as possible. The new headquarters will have 1.5 million square feet. A competition is being held for the design. The bank is owned by governments, with nearly 20 percent of the shares held by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. It is the biggest source of lending to Third World countries and approved more than $ 19 billion in loans last year. The bank turns a profit by borrowing money on world markets and putting it out at higher rates of return, both from borrowing governments and from business investments.

 A research and lobbying group opposed to abortion asked <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration officials on Wednesday to investigate the use of abortion as a means of choosing the sex of a baby. The <ORGANIZATION> Family </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> cited news reports as showing `` a significant trend'' toward sex-selection abortions and said `` the evidence suggests that it is overwhelmingly female fetuses'' that are being aborted.

<HEAD>Astronomers Say Star May Have Exploded Near Sun During Solar System

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 An unusual chemical composition found in <LOCATION> Halley </LOCATION>'s Comet suggests that a star may have exploded near the sun during the formation of the solar system some 4.6 billion years ago, according <ORGANIZATION> Arizona </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> astronomers. <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Wyckoff </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Arizona </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> professor of physics and astronomy, said Wednesday that a spectrum analysis of elements in <LOCATION> Halley </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Comet </ORGANIZATION> shows that its ratio of carbon isotopes is unlike any tested elsewhere in the solar system This suggests, she said, a supernova exploded near the sun and contaminated the gas cloud that later condensed to form the planets and other objects orbiting near the sun. `` If this hypothesis is correct, it means that when the sun formed, it did n't form as an isolated star,'' said <PERSON> Wychkoff </PERSON>. `` Like many other stars we know in the galaxy, the sun may have formed in a group or cluster of stars.'' One or more of the other stars in the cluster could have become a supernova. In such stellar explosions, she said, new chemical elements are formed and ejected. If this occurred near enough to contaminate the cloud from which the Earth and other parts of the solar system formed, then traces of those chemical isotopes would be found on those bodies. <PERSON> Halley </PERSON>'s Comet would have escaped this supernova contamination because it is believed to have formed in a region called the Kuiper belt, which is about 100 times farther from the sun than Pluto, the outermost of the planets. <PERSON> Wyckoff </PERSON> said the possibility of a supernova around the time of the solar system formation is speculation based on the difference in the ratios of the isotopes carbon 12 and carbon 13. The ratio is 89 parts of carbon 12 to one part carbon 13 in <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> and lunar samples, in meteorites and in the atmospheres of the planets Jupiter and <ORGANIZATION> Saturn </ORGANIZATION>. However, the carbon ratio in <PERSON> Haley </PERSON>'s Comet was found to be only 65-to-1, she said. The most logical explanation for this difference, said <PERSON> Wyckoff </PERSON>, is that the sun had a companion star that exploded. She cautioned, however, that more sampling is needed to confirm this speculation. `` The 65 is found only in <LOCATION> Halley </LOCATION>'s comet, but it is the only comet that has been looked at,'' said <PERSON> Wyckoff </PERSON>. `` The 89 ratio is found in virtually every other object that has been looked at.'' The astronomer said these ratio differences could also be explained if <PERSON> Halley </PERSON>'s Comet formed outside the solar system and then, through some gravitation perturbation, became trapped in an orbit of the sun. <PERSON> Wyckoff </PERSON> said this is considered `` improbable'' because of the great distances between the sun and other stars. <PERSON> Wyckoff </PERSON> said the speculation will be tested this summer when another periodic comet, called Brorsen-Metcalf, makes its near-pass by the sun. She said astronomers will use the same technique used on <PERSON> Halley </PERSON>'s to sample the chemistry of the cloud boiling out from <LOCATION> Brorsen-Metcalf </LOCATION> as the comet zips past the sun. <PERSON> Wyckoff </PERSON> said astronomers can sample the chemistry of a comet by using a powerful telescope to capture light reflected from the cloud around the object and then breaking this light into its wavelengths through a sensitive instrument. Each chemical isotope has a specific spectrum signature, enabling experts to measure the chemical ratios, she said. The comet study is being conducted by <PERSON> Wyckoff </PERSON> and <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wehinger </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Arizona </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Lindholm </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Princeton </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Jean-Marc </PERSON> <PERSON> Zucconi </PERSON> and <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Festou </PERSON> of <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, and Australian astronomer <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Peterson </PERSON>. A report on the finding is published in the April 1 issue of the Astrophysical Journal.

<TEXT>
 A missile race in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> is eroding <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s aerial supremacy and `` could dramatically change the balance of power'' in the region, <PERSON> Jane </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weekly </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday. It said <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> have missiles that could reach <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and `` <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> is rushing to catch up, introducing even more unpredictability.'' Arab countries are pursuing billion-dollar arms programs emphasizing missile development, <PERSON> Jane </PERSON>'s said. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> has possibly 100 nuclear weapons and its survival always has depended on air supremacy, the respected military affairs weekly reported. `` The acquisition by <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and major <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> military powers of increasingly sophisticated missiles capable of carrying nuclear warheads is eroding <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s technological superiority, particularly its traditional supremacy in the air,'' it said. According to <PERSON> Jane </PERSON>'s, this has forced <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> `` to consider fundamental changes in its military strategy.'' Through <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid and participation in research on space-based defense, `` <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> is trying to develop an anti-missile missile,'' <PERSON> Jane </PERSON>'s said, and its launch last year of a satellite with potential stretagic applications `` alarmed the Arabs.'' It said `` the equation changed significantly last year'' when <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> disclosed it had Chinese-made DF-3A -LRB- CSS-2 -RRB- missiles with a range of nearly 1,700 miles and capable of carrying 1.3-megaton nuclear warheads or 5,290 pounds of high explosive. `` The DF-3As were intended as defense against <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, although they can easily reach <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>,'' the weekly said. Growing arms industries in <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and some <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> countries undermine efforts by major industrialized nations to limit Third World access to missile technology and restrict systems to a 180-mile range and 1,100-pound payload, <PERSON> Jane </PERSON>'s reported. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> are working with <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> to develop a missile, based on <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>'s Condor-II system, with a range of 625 miles and a 3,300-pound warhead that could carry nuclear or chemical weapons, it said. The weekly said <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> was reported to be negotiating with <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> for <LOCATION> Oteiba </LOCATION> missiles, which have a range of 235 miles, and cited reports that <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> is helping <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> build a plant to manufacture 500-mile-range missiles. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> already has Chinese-made C-801 and C-601 anti-ship missiles, it said. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> have Soviet Scud missiles with 190-mile range, <PERSON> Jane </PERSON>'s said, and `` some, with Egyptian and <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> assistance, have extended their range with strap-on boosters.'' <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> was believed to have done that in the late stages of its war with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, in which a truce was reached last August. <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> has more than 100 Scuds plus an estimated 36 Scarab missiles that could reach <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> cities, the magazine said. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s nuclear-capable Jericho-I missiles have a range of 375 miles and it has tested an advanced version with an estimated range of 1,000 miles, the magazine said. It added that the Israelis also have about 150 U.S.-made Lance missiles with a range of 60 miles.

His motive was not known. <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Paus </PERSON> was unable immediately to identify the paintings by title. The man entered the museum about 1:45 p.m. and inflicted `` very bad damage'' to the paintings displayed in three rooms before he was spotted by a guard via a remote television camera, <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Paus </PERSON> said. Two guards tried to overpower the attacker, but he managed to escape by threatening them with the knife, according to <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Paus </PERSON>. `` They're really very heavily damaged, from some of them he cut whole chunks, and others have large diagonal slashes,'' <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Paus </PERSON> said. It was `` too early'' to establish whether the paintings were beyond repair, he said. The damaged paintings were from the core of the museum's collection, <PERSON> Paus </PERSON> said In December, three paintings by <PERSON> Vincent </PERSON> <PERSON> van </PERSON> <PERSON> Gogh </PERSON> were stolen from the Netherlands' Kroeller-Mueller museum. The works have not been recovered. In May, three paintings, among them a van <PERSON> Gogh </PERSON> and a work by <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Cezanne </PERSON>, were stolen from <LOCATION> Amsterdam </LOCATION>'s Municipal Museum. They were recovered 11 days later. The incidents have raised concern over security in Dutch museums, where government budget cuts have seriously reduced staffing levels.

 President <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Napoleon </PERSON> <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON>'s cancer is worsening but he should live long enough to hand over power to his successor on June 1, his doctor said Wednesday. <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON>, 63, has completed his eighth round of chemotherapy at <ORGANIZATION> Walter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and already has outlived the prognosis given when his terminal liver cancer was diagnosed last year, said Dr. <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Saca </PERSON>. `` <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON>'s condition is worsening, but he should live out his presidency,'' <PERSON> Saca </PERSON> said in an interview. He is to hand power over to President-elect <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON> of the rival <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nationalist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION> on June 1. <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON> went to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> for treatment the day after the March 19 election in which <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON>'s rightist party trounced <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> candidate, <PERSON> Fidel </PERSON> <PERSON> Chavez </PERSON> <PERSON> Mena </PERSON> `` There has been a deteriorating of the president's health,'' <PERSON> Saca </PERSON> said.

He was given about six to eight months to live. `` The president has surpassed the statistics,'' <PERSON> Saca </PERSON> noted. <PERSON> Saca </PERSON> said the cancer has spread in the president's liver but not to other organs. He said doctors who examined <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON> this month `` found that the damage to the liver was quite extensive.'' Despite his illness, <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON> should be able to govern until the inauguration, <PERSON> Saca </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Saca </PERSON> said <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON>'s disease `` is irreversible and only God knows how long he will live. We can only alleviate the pain. But I believe that he has the ability to keep working.'' <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON> was elected to a single, five-year term in 1984.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Panama </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Canal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> chairman announced Wednesday he was canceling a board meeting because of harassment by <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> leader <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> against waterway employees. The meeting of the five Americans and four Panamanians on the board that oversees the canal's operations was scheduled in <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION> on April 5 and 6. All of the members, known as directors, are appointed by the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> president. `` This decision is the result of the numerous unprecedented actions'' by <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> against canal employees, said chairman <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gianelli </PERSON>. `` If <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> keeps putting this pressure on canal employees, it could endanger the operations of the canal,'' said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Rhode </PERSON>, the commission's secretary. `` We believe the canal should be kept out of politics,'' he added in an interview. <PERSON> Rhode </PERSON> said the Panamanian directors had not participated in the board's quarterly meetings since January 1988. This January, the Panamanians came to the meeting and read a statement saying they would not take part as long as the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> continues to recognize <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Arturo </PERSON> <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> as their country's president, <PERSON> Rhode </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> was ousted by <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> in February 1988. The absence of the Panamanians has not affected operations of the board and the running of the waterway because the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> directors are in the majority, <PERSON> Rhode </PERSON> said. But <PERSON> Gianelli </PERSON> feels the canal's administrator, <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> McAuliffe </PERSON>, and his senior staff can not come to the <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION> meeting `` at this critical time,'' <PERSON> Rhode </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> is under indictment in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> on drug trafficking charges and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has refused to recognize the authority of his ally, President <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Solis </PERSON> <PERSON> Palma </PERSON>. As the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration vowed to continue efforts to force <PERSON> Noreiga </PERSON> to step down, the Panamanian government began to take steps against the canal workers, such as denying them license plates for their cars. The 1977 <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> Canal Treaties give the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> primary responsibility for canal operation and defense until Dec. 31, 1999, when <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> assumes responsibility and sovereignty over the waterway.

<HEAD>Researcher Says Evidence Shows Great Lakes Fish Can Be Harmful</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 There is conclusive evidence that eating chemically tainted Great Lakes fish can cause health problems in humans, a researcher said Wednesday at a workshop assessing the impact of pollutants on nature. At greatest risk are infants born to women who eat fish once a week caught by non-commercial anglers, said <PERSON> Wayland </PERSON> <PERSON> Swain </PERSON>, former director of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>'s Great Lakes research laboratory in <LOCATION> Grosse </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ile </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich </LOCATION>. Citing several previous studies, <PERSON> Swain </PERSON> said such infants tended to be born early with low birth weights, small head circumferences, neuromuscular problems and impaired responses to visual stimuli. Researchers have found that toxic PCBs contained in the fish can be transmitted from mother to child during pregnancy, said <PERSON> Swain </PERSON>, vice president of the <ORGANIZATION> Eco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Logic </ORGANIZATION> consulting company in <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Arbor </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Mich </LOCATION>. Although the research is not new, <PERSON> Swain </PERSON> said he is the first to compile studies on the problem. He presented his report to the workshop organized by the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, made up of representatives of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>. The panel acts as an advisory committee to governments of both nations on issues relating to the Great Lakes. Other researchers at the two-day workshop discussed health problems in wildlife caused by PCBs, or polychlorinated biphenyls, toxic chemicals used in electrical and industrial equipment but banned in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> since the early 1970s. Problems cited include reproductive difficulties and physical deformities in birds, snapping turtles and otters that live in the Great Lakes region. PCBs `` are generally very resistant to degradation,'' both in the environment and in the human body, <PERSON> Swain </PERSON> said. Despite the national ban, they have remained in the environment and are collecting at the bottom of all the <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lakes </LOCATION>, he said. `` There are a number of clean-up efforts proposed and some of them have been started,'' he said. `` My impression is, given the effects we're seeing across the animal species and in the human organism, we need to accelerate'' those efforts, <PERSON> Swain </PERSON> said. He said his report is based on studies that include a continuing investigation by <ORGANIZATION> Wayne </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> researchers in <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> of 313 mothers and infants. The researchers are investigating whether the health problems noted in infants of mothers who eat <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lakes </LOCATION> fish continue into early childhood. <PERSON> Swain </PERSON> said a similar study of Taiwanese infants `` found effects durable into early childhood.'' Children of Taiwanese women who ate PCB-tainted rice oil `` did less well on all scales of intelligence'' than children who were not exposed to the chemical, he said. <PERSON> Swain </PERSON> said researchers need to determine which of 209 possible PCB-related chemicals are the most toxic. `` Only a relatively few of them are the real culprits in producing the toxicity problem,'' he said. Fish caught by sports fishermen are the most likely to be affected, <PERSON> Swain </PERSON> said. `` Human consumption of fish sold commercially is generally controlled and regulated through the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- so we do n't presumably come in contact with contaminated fish,'' he said. Fish caught by anglers, of course, are not regulated. The workshop was organized to give participants _ about 100 scientists from <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lakes </LOCATION> states and provinces _ a chance to compare research and to encourage more cooperation in identifying environmental problems and their solutions, said commission spokeswoman <PERSON> Sally </PERSON> <PERSON> Cole-Misch </PERSON>.

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has provided `` a reasonable framework'' for rescuing the thrift industry, but his plan relies on economic assumptions that may prove too optimistic, the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> reiterated Wednesday. Those rosy predictions, about such factors as interest rates, the economic outlook and the growth of deposits, mean the plan's costs `` are likely to be somewhat higher than those currently forecast,'' the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> said in a report that repeated the conclusions its officials offered in congressional testimony earlier this month The independent congressional agency also disagreed with the administration's plan to finance the multibillion-dollar bailout separate from the federal budget. Financing the rescue plan as part of the budget is desirable, the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> said, because that would allow financing at the cheapest available rates. The agency said the off-budget strategy could add $ 1 billion to the overall bailout cost during the next decade and $ 4.5 billion over 30 years. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> banking committees are considering <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s plan, under which the administration proposes to shut down or merge about 350 insolvent institutions and meet commitments from last year's rescue of 205 others <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also proposed placing new capital requirements on thrifts, and splitting up the responsibilities of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, which operates 12 regional banks. The administration has estimated the plan will cost $ 150 billion to $ 200 billion through 1999, including financing costs. The <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>, using the administration's own economic assumptions, forecasts a $ 205 billion figure. Without coming up with its own price tag, <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> said it questioned assumptions in the rescue plan that interest rates will fall sharply from levels at the end of 1988. Higher-than-expected rates could increase financing costs and hurt shaky institutions. The <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> also said a recession, which some economists believe is likely in the next several years, could increase the number of failing thrifts. And it said deposits may grow more slowly than the plan assumes, cutting premium income. The plan could cost an extra $ 7 billion over 10 years if deposits grow at only 3 percent a year instead of the assumed 7 percent, according to Rep. Rep. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Kanjorski </PERSON>, D-Pa., who requested the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> study

 The army Wednesday sealed off the occupied lands for 24 hours and put the entire <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> under a curfew as troops and police braced for violence on the annual `` Land Day'' protest by <PERSON> Arabs </PERSON>. Arabs on Thursday will mark Land Day, commemorating a confrontation in their villages in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Galilee </LOCATION> on March 30, 1976, when six people were killed after the army and police opened fire on demonstrators protesting government seizure of Arab land. This year's Land Day protest is drawing widespread concern in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. Officials and newspaper editorials have warned of an effort by leaders of the 15-month uprising in the occupied territories to bring their protest into <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> itself. <PERSON> Ariel </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s right-wing trade minister, said Wednesday that Israelis will not tolerate <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> violence within their country. `` Those radicals among the Israeli Arabs must understand it will not be possible to push the Jews endlessly to the wall,'' he said. Last year, 30,000 Israeli Arabs marched on Land Day in support of the Palestinian revolt. There were no major incidents inside <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, but four Palestinians were shot to death in clashes in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. The underground Palestinian leaders have called for a general strike Thursday, and leaflets distributed in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> urge Palestinians to `` make the land anniversary an occasion to escalate the uprising and burn the land under the Zionists.'' The army sealed off the occupied lands for 24 hours beginning at midnight Wednesday -LRB- 5 p.m. EST -RRB-, banning all Palestinian travel to and from the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>. The measure was to prevent Land Day violence, a spokesman said. He said the entire <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> was placed under curfew as of 8 p.m. Wednesday -LRB- 1 p.m. EST -RRB- that forced the <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> population of 650,000 to stay indoors. `` When tension rises, we have no other choice but to respond with wide-ranging curfews,'' army Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Shomron </PERSON> said. `` If necessary, the army will act very decisively. `` I hope the residents understand ... that to think we're just a stone-throw away from a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> state is only an illusion.'' Thousands of extra troops were sent to the occupied lands. In the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> town of <LOCATION> Bethlehem </LOCATION>, hundreds of soldiers were seen taking up positions along main roads. Also in <LOCATION> Bethlehem </LOCATION>, a Palestinian died when an unidentified object exploded inside his house, the army said. <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> reports suggested the man, whose name was not given, might have been making a bomb. In scattered stone-throwing clashes, three Palestinians were wounded by army gunfire, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> hospital officials said. At least 412 Arabs and 18 Israelis have been killed since the Palestinian uprising began in December 1988. The army said reporters would only be allowed to travel to the occupied lands Thursday accompanied by military officials. Inside <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, leaders of the 810,000 Israeli Arabs also have declared their own general strike. They say the main purpose is to protest unfair treatment, such as inadequate municipal funding, but agree that Land Day protests are also a show of support for the Palestinian rebellion. `` We are citizens of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and part of the <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> people. This is a form of support for their uprising,'' said <PERSON> Mustafa </PERSON> <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Rias </PERSON>, municipal council head in the <LOCATION> Galilee </LOCATION> village of <LOCATION> Sakhnin </LOCATION>. `` We are acting under the symbol of support for the uprising. Two states for two people!'' Anticipating trouble, police forces have canceled all vacations and launched a special operation to counter any Land Day problems inside <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. `` We have about 5,000 men, including 4,500 police and border police and 500 soldiers,'' said Police Commissioner <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Krauss </PERSON>. `` We will have sufficient forces to deal with every deviation and disturbance.'' Last week, members of new police `` Special Patrol Units'' and 100 high school students held a mock battle in the northern town of <LOCATION> Afula </LOCATION> in preparation for Land Day. The students chanted slogans and threw rocks and fake firebombs. <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> activists made preparations, too. <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> flags flew from mosque roofs and utility poles. New pro-PLO slogans were scrawled on walls in several <LOCATION> Galilee </LOCATION> villages. In <PERSON> Kafr </PERSON> <PERSON> Kanna </PERSON>, three vehicles were set ablaze, and police said they suspect Arab nationalist motives were involved. Youths in <LOCATION> Sakhnin </LOCATION>, where three people died in the 1976 riots, said they have prepared `` bottles and other things'' in case police intervene in Land Day demonstrations.

 The disabled <PERSON> Exxon </PERSON> <PERSON> Valdez </PERSON> had complied with all modern construction standards for oil tankers, but it tore open in Alaskan waters because no design is immune to the consequences of human error, a <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> official said Wednesday. A spokesman said, however, that the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> plans no disciplinary action against any of the tanker's officers unless the results of an investigation by another federal agency of the oil spill show it is warranted. Investigators from the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> looking into the nation's worst oil spill said they were focusing on actions of the ship's captain, <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Hazelwood </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> officials said he had left the bridge to his third mate when the ship hit a charted reef Friday and spilled 10.1 million gallons of oil into Prince <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sound </PERSON>. `` It's a very new ship. I do n't see any deficiencies at all,'' said <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Angelo </PERSON>, assistant chief of the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION>'s Merchant Vessel Inspection and Documentation Division. The safety board is investigating because the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION>, which is responsible for tracking vessels in the sound, could be a subject of the inquiry, said <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> spokesman Capt. <PERSON> Randy </PERSON> <PERSON> Peterson </PERSON>. <PERSON> Angelo </PERSON> said the 967-foot Exxon Valdez, built in 1986, meets all the latest construction and equipment requirements, including the installation of ballasts designed to protect against oil spills. `` The current standards that exist for the most modern tankers are good,'' said <PERSON> Angelo </PERSON>. `` But no matter what you do, you ca n't cover every possible aspect if human error is involved. The <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> supervises the design and construction of major merchant marine vessels and conducts annual inspections of vessels flying the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> flag, he said. It has authority over more than 500 major ships and thousands of smaller vessels. The Exxon Valdez, one of 72 oil tankers that have loaded crude oil from <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Slope </LOCATION>, was last given an inspection certificate in November 1988, <PERSON> Angelo </PERSON> said. Its certificate expires in 1990, with an interim inspection slated this November. The Exxon Valdez was constructed with a single bottom rather than the double bottom used in some ships built in the late 1970s when the government was considering requiring the added layer as a protection against oil spills, he said. Instead, an international standard for oil tankers was adopted which requires water-filled ballasts around portions of the ship rather than the double bottom. The ballasts offer some protection against oil spillage if a ship either hits bottom or is in a collision. The <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> ship has several ballasts, but the impact was too severe for them to prevent damage. Exxon authorities have said the tanker has five holes in its starboard side, the largest of which is 6 by 20 feet. <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Peterson </PERSON> said officials would await the results of the <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION> investigation before deciding whether disciplinary action might be taken against <PERSON> Hazelwood </PERSON> or any other officer of the Exxon Valdez. When it ran aground, the ship was being operated by its third mate, <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON> <PERSON> Cousins </PERSON>, who records show was not licensed in Prince <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sound </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION>, which licenses all maritime officers and issues merchant marine documents to other members of ships' crews, has the power to take away licenses for negligence, misconduct or incompetence, said licensing official <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Flyntz </PERSON>. <PERSON> Flyntz </PERSON> said <PERSON> Hazelwood </PERSON>, since his license allowed him to operate the largest ships, was a highly qualified ship's master who had passed extensive training and licensing procedures. Licenses for merchant ships' officers have to be renewed every five years. Coast Guard records show that <PERSON> Hazelwood </PERSON>'s license was issued for the third five-year period in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> on Dec. 12, 1986, declaring him `` master of ocean steam or motor vessels of any gross tons.'' He also was qualified as a radar navigator and was licensed for Prince <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sound </PERSON>. Cousins, whom <PERSON> Flyntz </PERSON> described as `` a highly qualified individual,'' was licensed last Jan. 12 in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> as a second mate, one degree higher than the post he had on the Exxon Valdez. He also was qualified as a radar navigator, which would include the ability to use radar to spot the shoreline and other ships but not an underwater reef. He is not licensed for the sound. <ORGANIZATION> Pilotage </ORGANIZATION> licenses have arduous requirements, <PERSON> Flyntz </PERSON> said, including the ability to take a blank piece of paper and map the waterway with all navigational marks, shipping channels and depths from memory.

The fine was imposed on <ORGANIZATION> Daiichi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jitsugyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> subsidiary of <ORGANIZATION> Daiichi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jitsugyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Toyko </LOCATION>, whose <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> office purchases oil and gas drilling equipment. <ORGANIZATION> Daiichi </ORGANIZATION> allegedly agreed to require a shipper moving equipment to <LOCATION> Oman </LOCATION> to agree not to ship goods on vessels blacklisted by the <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION>. It also allegedly failed to report that it received boycott-related requests. Most Arab League countries boycott goods and services from <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and maintain lists of people and companies doing business with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Daiichi </ORGANIZATION> agreed to pay the civil penalty but did not admit or deny guilty. In an earlier case, the firm in 1980 agreed to pay a $ 9,000 penalty for allegedly furnishing prohibited information and violating the reporting requirements of the anti-boycott law. The Export Administration Act prohibits <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> individuals and companies from providing information about their business relationships with boycotted countries and from refusing to do business with others because of foreign boycotts. The anti-boycott provisions were adopted to keep <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> firms from participating in foreign boycotts which are not supported by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> or which are directed toward countries friendly to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 The nation's first private spaceship blasted off Wednesday for a 15-minute sub-orbital flight that sponsors hope will usher in the age of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> commercial space industry. `` It's the first of many, and we think it's the real breakthrough,'' said <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Vance </PERSON>, whose company, <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, launched the Consort 1. `` I thought it was terrific,'' said <PERSON> Carol </PERSON> <PERSON> Lane </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s division that licensed the Consort 1. `` It's a great beginning.'' The rocket's payload of six scientific experiments underwent near-weightlessness for a little more than seven minutes during the flight. The rocket rose 178 miles and fell to earth about 58 miles north of its launch pad at White Sands Missile Range. Houston-based Space Services, which employs 14 people, is the same company that pioneered private space exploration by launching the Conestoga 1 from <LOCATION> Matagorda </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, with a dummy payload in September 1982. The company dealt with 18 government agencies to get permission to launch Consort 1. It even had to obtain an export license from the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> because the dummy payload landed in international waters in the <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration, in an effort to open outer space to private enterprise, directed the <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> to process and issue launch licenses and help cut red tape with other federal agencies. `` It's been a six-year countdown. We've been in a long hold,'' said <PERSON> Vance </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>' vice president for finance and adminstration. `` When we went up in'82, there was no infrastructure for commercial launches to happen.'' Space Services plans similar suborbital launches in the next couple of years, and is applying for a license to be the first private contractor to send a satellite into orbit. `` In fact, we see the sounding -LRB- suborbital -RRB- rocket business as where we'll get a foothold in the industry and the orbital business is where we'll make the big bucks,'' <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Daniels </PERSON> said. `` I think there's a big future for this,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> management analyst <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Davidson </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s 22-employee commercial space transportation department expects to process 10 launch licenses this year, <PERSON> Lane </PERSON> said. Five companies are offering private launch services, and <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> are considering offering spaceports for private companies, she said. Consort 1 cost $ 1 million to $ 2 million. The rocket consisted of a modified <ORGANIZATION> Terrier </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> rocket booster, with a Black <PERSON> Brant </PERSON> sounding rocket as a second stage. A 17-inch-wide, 11 -LCB- - foot-long capsule held the payload The entire vehicle stood 52 feet tall and weighed 6,000 pounds at liftoff. Consort 1's payload consisted of experiments that normally are carried aboard the space shuttle as `` Getaway Specials.'' But the experiments did n't need to undergo days of near-weightlessness. The six experiments were assembled by the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alabama-Huntsville </ORGANIZATION>'s Consortium for Materials Development in Space, one of 16 commercial development consortiums sponsored by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>. The payload included experiments designed to measure how liquids mix in weightlessness, how plastic foam forms and cures, how liquids coat glass surfaces, how epoxy reacts in weightlessness and how finely powdered metals bond under high temperature to produce alloys. The experiments have applications in medicine, the manufacture of metal alloys and in construction of space stations. University spokesman <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Dooling </PERSON> said a preliminary look at the contents showed the flight was successful. `` The scientific team and the <ORGANIZATION> SSI </ORGANIZATION> team are both extremely happy with the results,'' <PERSON> Dooling </PERSON> said. `` We think this is an outstanding beginning, not only for space exploration, but for space experimentation.''

<HEAD>Japan To Sign Contract Despite Uncertainty Over FSX Cooperation</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-FSX</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> said it will sign a contract by Friday with <ORGANIZATION> Mitsubishi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Heavy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> to develop its next-generation fighter jet, but negotiations continue with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> over co-production, an official said. The <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> official said on condition of anonymity that the agency decided to sign a contract with <ORGANIZATION> Mitsubishi </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday or Friday even if <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> do not reach a final agreement on the FSX project by then. <PERSON> Takaaki </PERSON> <PERSON> Yamada </PERSON>, vice president of <ORGANIZATION> Mitsubishi </ORGANIZATION>'s aircraft division, called the decision `` a step forward in the FSX joint development project.'' A group of Japanese legislators meanwhile said on Wednesday that <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> might want to build the FSX aircraft on its own. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Japanese officials have been meeting this week in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> to conclude an agreement on joint development of the plane. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> says agreement must be reached by Friday so money for it can be included in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s budget for the fiscal year beginning April 1. White House spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said Wednesday <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials are not sure if accord will be reached by then. He said the delay is due directly to President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s insistence on safeguards to protect <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> technology. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said Tuesday he still wants to clarify the agreement. Administration sources said the questions remaining involve who will own technology resulting from the project and what percentage of the fighter's development should be done in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Persisting disagreement over the FSX agreement has generated annoyance in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> over <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> objections to an accord originally reached last year. On Wednesday, 43 legislators from the governing <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> presented a petition to the government urging it to proceed with development of the fighter with or without <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> help. `` We have decided that joint development of the next fighter is important for the security of our country ... -LRB- and -RRB- should go ahead immediately under the agreement since it is crucial to our national defense,'' the petition said. `` However, if there is a concern on the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> side, we should scrap the agreement and develop the jet independently.'' Under the FSX agreement signed late last year, <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Louis-based </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dynamics </ORGANIZATION> would join <ORGANIZATION> Mitsubishi </ORGANIZATION> as a subcontractor in developing the FSX as an advanced version of its F-16 fighter. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said last week he endorsed the pact for joint development of the FSX fighter, which was concluded by the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration, but wanted some changes to protect <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> technology. Proponents say the agreement was the best deal the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> could negotiate in the face of Japanese opposition to buying U.S.-made F-16s. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> opponents of joint FSX development complained it amounts to a giveaway of advanced aircraft technology that <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> could use to compete with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in the world civilian aircraft market. Japanese opponents argued that <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> should scrap the accord and go ahead with its original plan to develop the jet on its own. `` <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> has the ability to develop the FSX independently,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> official quoted a member of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investigation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> as saying Wednesday. `` We should cope with the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> objection by preparing a blueprint for independent development'' of the fighter.

<BYLINE>Utah Governor Calls Special Session On Fusion Funding, ^By MICHAEL

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SALT LAKE CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> officials, excited by the prospect that two scientists may have unlocked the secret of the sun with basic chemistry, have pledged $ 5 million to expand the experiments into nuclear fusion. And the resigning head of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> confirmed in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> on Wednesday that he will head up the project. <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Utah </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Chase </PERSON> <PERSON> Peterson </PERSON> said the $ 5 million will sustain the research while the university and state officials negotiate with 200 private corporations that have indicated an interest. The chairman of the university's chemistry department and a British professor announced last week that they had done what has stumped scientists for more than 30 years _ creating energy by fusing atoms in glass flasks at room temperature. Scientists around the world greeted the announcement with enthusiasm and skepticism, including one who warned that if the so-called cold fusion had occurred it could pose a serious radiation threat. The implications of such a discovery are enormous _ cheap, safe, simple electrical power in an era dominated by petroleum-fueled political tensions. Potential applications range from `` 100 horsepower power plants small enough for a car'' to 50-megawatt generating plants, said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Brophy </PERSON>, university vice president for research. `` We know the science is true. We do n't know about the engineering and economics,'' he said. Gov. <PERSON> Norm </PERSON> <PERSON> Bangerter </PERSON> announced Tuesday that the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> will convene April 7 to appropriate the funds. House and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> leaders, who had balked on the appropriation until the experiments were confirmed, were sold on the idea after <PERSON> Peterson </PERSON> outlined the process during a closed meeting earlier Tuesday and promised that the agenda for the special session would be limited to fusion. Because the university has applied for patents on the fusion process, lawmakers are hoping that the state will realize a financial windfall by licensing private corporations to use the technology. `` The numbers are staggering in terms of what this thing will bring in if the patents hold,'' said <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Speaker <PERSON> Nolan </PERSON> <PERSON> Karras </PERSON>. House Majority Leader <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> Moody </PERSON> said Wednesday he had no doubt the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> would approve the funding. `` It's not a matter of if it will happen, but when,'' he said. The cash will help the university lure `` five to 15 world experts'' in fusion and engineering, <PERSON> Peterson </PERSON> said. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Fletcher </PERSON>, 69, the <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> chief who has already been recruited, is a physicist who was the university's president from 1964-71. `` If they do'' verify the experiment, <PERSON> Fletcher </PERSON> said, `` it is really something gangbusters. That would be the best thing that's happened since I guess the atomic bomb _ and that was bad, but in terms of breakthroughs it would certainly be a bigger factor than the transistor when that was built. `` But the jury is still out. We still have to verify it,'' he added. University officials said <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Teller </PERSON>, recognized as the father of the hydrogen bomb, may visit the campus sometime next week. Fusion occurs in the sun and in hydrogen bombs. `` The real question is, how do we stay out in front of the world on this. This identifies <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> as a center now'' for cold-fusion research, <PERSON> Peterson </PERSON> said at the news conference. Electrochemists <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> <PERSON> Pons </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fleischmann </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southampton </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> announced last Thursday that they had sustained fusion for more than 100 hours in a flask. They said they generated four watts of electricity for every one watt they used to power their device. <PERSON> Pons </PERSON> and <PERSON> Fleischmann </PERSON>'s research will be published in May by the Journal of Electroanalytical Chemistry, and an article has been submitted to the British science journal <ORGANIZATION> Nature </ORGANIZATION>, said university spokeswoman <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Shelley </PERSON>. <PERSON> Peterson </PERSON> acknowledged the process could prove invalid or without practical application. But he said he believed the research was solid. He said several scientists, whom he did not identify, had reviewed the <PERSON> Pons </PERSON> and <PERSON> Fleischmann </PERSON> article and were optimistic the experiment did in fact produce fusion. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Soures </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rochester </ORGANIZATION> fusion researcher, said that if the <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> experiment actually produced energy, it also emitted dangerous levels of neutron particles.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> heard arguments Wednesday on whether sculptor <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Earl </PERSON> <PERSON> Reid </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION> was an employee or an independent contractor when he created `` Third World America,'' depicting the plight of the homeless, for a Washington-based group. In 1985, with a handshake, the Community for Creative Non-Violence, a homeless advocacy group, commissioned a sculpture of a man, woman and infant huddled on a steam grate. The group auctioned donated works of local artists to pay <PERSON> Reid </PERSON> $ 15,000 for expenses and assistants. <PERSON> Reid </PERSON> donated his time. When the group planned to take the sculpture on a tour of several cities to raise money for the homeless, <PERSON> Reid </PERSON> objected, saying the work was too fragile. He urged the group to have the work cast in bronze or make a master mold, but the group declined. <PERSON> Reid </PERSON>, who had the sculpture while making some repairs, refused to return it, and registered it under his name. The Community for Creative Non-Violence filed suit claiming exclusive copyright ownership. A federal judge ruled the sculpture was `` a work made for hire'' and the group had the copyright. But a federal appeals court overturned that decision, saying the group owned the work but must share the copyright and any profits with <PERSON> Reid </PERSON>. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Garrett </PERSON>, the organization's attorney, told the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> that in an employment relationship the employer has a right to control the product, and that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has recognized such a relationship can exist without a written contract. <PERSON> Garrett </PERSON> said organizations have been relying on such laws in their dealings with artists. <PERSON> Joshua </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaufman </PERSON>, <PERSON> Reid </PERSON>'s attorney, argued that an agreement does n't constitute employment unless there's a written contract and the employee receives all the benefits of employment. `` If employers do n't provide benefits, they're not entitled to fruits'' beyond the product, he said. `` This whole issue attacks the spirit of creativity,'' <PERSON> Reid </PERSON> said after the arguments. Referring to the statue displayed nearby, <PERSON> Reid </PERSON> said: `` The work that you see is mine _ my spirit, my vision, my artistry.'' <PERSON> Garrett </PERSON>, however, said the group provided <PERSON> Reid </PERSON> with the idea, its specifications and the group's `` experience with the homeless.'' The case is Community for Creative Non-Violence vs. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Earl </PERSON> <PERSON> Reid </PERSON>, 88-293.

 A group of senators Wednesday called on <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> to extend a program that provides the drug AZT to AIDS victims who can not afford the costly treatment. The program is due to expire Friday. `` Without swift action by the administration, lifesaving treatments will be abruptly terminated for thousands of people with AIDS,'' said the letter signed by Sen. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, D-Mass., Sen. <PERSON> Orrin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hatch </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Utah </LOCATION>, and 11 others Two weeks ago, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> turned back a Kennedy-sponsored bill to extend the program when three Republican critics refused to let the measure be acted on without debate or consideration of amendments. <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>'s bill would require the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> to redirect $ 5 million in federal AIDS funds to the AZT program for use through September. Currently nearly 7,000 AIDS victims are receiving AZT under the program. The average cost of the drug treatment is $ 600 a month. <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> have already run out of federal funds allocated to them under the program, and <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> are due to run out of money at the end of this month, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Campaign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION>, an AIDS advocacy group. Programs in other states, including <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, which account for about a third of all enrollees, will have spent all their federal money by the end of June. Other states have enough to hold them through the end of August, the AIDS group said. If the program expires, 2,875 people would be affected by the end of June and 4,767 by the end of September, the AIDS group said. HHS has reprogrammed $ 10 million under the program since it was renewed last September. However, the senators said the department had been authorized to redirect $ 15 million, and they added: `` It was the desire of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> when this program was continued that the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> fully fund the program through the reprogramming of available AIDS funds.''

 With divorce as common as it is, schools should familiarize children with its painful reality, the new president of an organization of school psychologists said Wednesday. Even if a child is not going through a divorce, he or she may have friends who are and needs to know how to react to their troubles, said <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Knoff </PERSON>, associate professor of psychology at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Knoff </PERSON>, speaking at the annual convention of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Psychologists </ORGANIZATION>, said 40 percent of all current marriages in the country will end in divorce and 40 percent to 50 percent of all children born in the past decade will at one time or another live in a single-parent family. <PERSON> Knoff </PERSON> said the knowledge that a child is not alone in his or her difficulties, and that parents are still available for support, is essential to coping with divorce. Children commonly feel they are somehow to blame for the breakup. `` These reactions often involve depression, withdrawal, grieving, fear and decreased academic and other school performance,'' <PERSON> Knoff </PERSON> said. He recommended more counseling and teaching about divorce, especially for children whose parents are splitting up.

<TEXT>
 Attorney General <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> said Wednesday he's concerned about a `` very serious threat of erosion'' in the caliber of people seeking federal law enforcement jobs because of low pay. `` I ca n't speak highly enough of those who are engaged in the federal law enforcement effort in general today, but I'm extremely concerned about the failure to keep abreast of the pay and benefit needs of these employees,'' <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> said during a luncheon meeting with reporters. He said he was `` stunned'' that federal agents such as those who work for the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> who were considered `` the elite'' in the 1970s, have now reversed roles with their state and local counterparts. `` That's not all bad,'' he said, because it means `` state and local law enforcement agencies are attracting the type and caliber of personnel that they need to do their job ... `` But it does mean that there is a very serious threat of erosion in the quality and quantity of the type of people that we need in federal service,'' <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> said. `` I've pledged to my people that I'll be a very outspoken proponent of their needs,'' he said. <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> said he was concerned not only for the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> agents, but also for <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Marshals, prison officials and law enforcement personnel in other areas such as the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. In fact, the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> fare reasonably well compared with such <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> agents as those in the <ORGANIZATION> Secret </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alcohol </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tobacco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Firearms </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents start at just over $ 31,500 and can go as high as $ 45,000 after about seven years, according to <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Greg </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>. The only people who earn more are in management, except for those in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. There, under a five-year congressionally authorized demonstration project, agents earn 25 percent more than their salary would be anywhere else because of the high cost of living in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, he said. At the <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION>, non-management agents start at about $ 24,000 and can reach in the upper $ 50,000 range, according to <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Con </PERSON> <PERSON> Dougherty </PERSON>. Secret Service Director <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON> told a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> panel earlier this month that his service was offering $ 18,000 to incoming agents, and recently had lost a three-year agent to the <LOCATION> Suffolk </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> police force in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, where he'll earn $ 55,000 a year. Meanwhile, <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>, director of <ORGANIZATION> Alcohol </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tobacco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Firearms </ORGANIZATION>, told the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> hearing that starting salaries in his bureau were $ 15,000 to $ 18,000. On other issues, <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> said: _ He is `` impatient'' to get his staff in place and has `` short lists'' of candidates for virtually all the agencies his department oversees, such as the <ORGANIZATION> Immigration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Naturalization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Marshals </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> and others `` The short list, in some cases, includes the incumbent,'' he said, but he would not disclose for which agencies or when announcements would be made on the appointments. _ He plans no more audits of any agencies such as those that severely criticized the operations of the <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Marshals </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> because those audits were leaked to the news media `` I'm never going to run another audit again,'' he said `` They're supposed to be management tools and not hammers to be used to embarrass people,'' he said. _ His two top aides, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> and <PERSON> Murray </PERSON> <PERSON> Dickman </PERSON>, have been the main people involved in screening of possible judicial candidates, and that function will remain in his personal office They are working with people from the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> counsel's office in that effort, he said. Asked whether he would be concerned about a judicial candidate's membership in restricted private clubs, <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> said it was a `` political question and that's something that I think the president and his staff are going to have to face with regard to what the opinions are on the -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>Moslem Leader, Aide Shot Dead At Brussels Mosque</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The leader of Moslems in <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Luxembourg </LOCATION> and his aide were shot and killed Wednesday, five weeks after the imam distanced himself from <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s death sentence for author <PERSON> Salman </PERSON> <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> Imam <PERSON> Abdullah </PERSON> <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Ahdal </PERSON>, a 36-year-old Saudi Arabian and moderate Moslem, and <LOCATION> Salem </LOCATION> <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Behir </LOCATION>, a 40-year-old Tunisian who headed the <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION> mosque's social services and library, were shot at close range in the imam's office in the mosque, police said. No one immediately claimed responsibility, and no arrests were made. Police said there were no witnesses and that no one heard the gunshots. The two men each were shot twice, once in the head and once in the neck, police said. Unconfirmed reports said three hooded men were seen jumping from a van, entering the mosque and then coming out again. The bodies were found by members of the Islamic community early Wednesday evening. On Feb. 14, Iranian revolutionary patriarch <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> issued a death sentence for <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> for `` The Satanic Verses,'' a novel many Moslems consider blasphemous. In a Feb. 20 interview on <ORGANIZATION> RTBF </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>'s French-language television network, <PERSON> Ahdal </PERSON> agreed that <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>'s book was blasphemous. But he said of <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>'s death sentence: `` One should not have done that. <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> should have first appeared -LRB- before an Islamic tribunal -RRB-. He should have explained himself, defend himself. He should have been asked to repent.'' In democratic societies `` everyone has the right to speak his thoughts, to express himself as he wants,'' <PERSON> Ahdal </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> van </PERSON> <PERSON> Engeland </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> RTBF </ORGANIZATION> reporter, said Wednesday the network had received angry phone calls after the interview from callers who claimed <PERSON> Ahdal </PERSON>, who spoke in Arabic, was improperly translated. <PERSON> Ahdal </PERSON>'s mosque, in a park near the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> headquarters, is part of the London-based <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION>. After the killings, police cordoned off the building. At one point a woman wearing a black veil emerged from the building and threatened a reporter with a handgun. Several police officers struggled with the woman and wrested the gun from her. They said later she was <PERSON> Ahdal </PERSON>'s widow. <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>, a Briton who was born in <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> to a Moslem family but no longer practices religion, is in hiding in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. Moslems object to `` The Satanic Verses'' because of a brothel scene in which prostitutes take the names of the Prophet <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON>'s wives and because it suggests <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> wrote the holy Koran instead of receiving it from <PERSON> Allah </PERSON>. Members of the Islamic community told reporters outside the building their mosque takes a very conciliatory tone. `` We respect everybody,'' one said on condition of anonymity. `` We do not take radical positions.'' <PERSON> Ahdal </PERSON> had been in <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION> for six years heading the Moslem community in <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Luxembourg </LOCATION>. His aide had been here for about 10 years. <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Sulim </PERSON>, a professor of Islamic religion, asked the Moslem community to remain calm. He said, `` We are a few days from the Ramadan,'' which Moslems mark with a month of fasting during the day. `` These are days for prayer. One must not seek revenge. The imam was a tolerant man, a generous man, he lent his money to several people.''

<HEAD>Planned Parenthood Criticizes USAir On Discounts for Anti-Abortionists</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Planned Parenthood criticized <ORGANIZATION> USAir </ORGANIZATION> Wednesday for giving discount fares to an anti-abortion group whose <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> convention ended in 700 arrests, but an airline spokesman said politics is not the basis for discounts. `` It raises serious legal and moral questions when an airline grants consumer discounts to an organization that is, by its own admission, going to break the law by preventing people from exercising their rights to reproductive health care,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Andrews </PERSON>, Planned Parenthood acting national president. <PERSON> Andrews </PERSON> said the discounts encourage the group, <ORGANIZATION> Operation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rescue </ORGANIZATION>, in its efforts to `` disrupt the rights of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> citizens.'' Planned Parenthood advocates voluntary family planning and says people have the right to choose whether to have children. The anti-abortion group blockaded a <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> women's clinic Saturday in defiance of a federal court order. Police in riot gear arrested 725 Operation Rescue protesters, citing most for trespassing. Most of those detained were released. The <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> incident was the largest of several Operation Rescue actions against abortion clinics in several cities. <ORGANIZATION> USAir </ORGANIZATION> spokeman <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Shipley </PERSON> confirmed that Operation Rescue members got discount fares for their <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> convention but said he did not know how much they were. He said the airline routinely offers discounts of 30 to 40 percent to any large group holding a meeting or convention, including Planned Parenthood. The discount is based on the group's size, the season and the market, and not on its beliefs, <PERSON> Shipley </PERSON> said `` We ca n't make judgments based on political, social or other factors. We're an airline. We carry people,'' he said.

 A lawmaker from the governing <ORGANIZATION> Motherland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> shot and killed an opposition deputy in the <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> building Wednesday, the city prosecutor said. A third lawmaker said he had argued with the gunman over this week's elections and that the gunfire was intended for him. Prosecutor <PERSON> Akin </PERSON> <PERSON> Oncul </PERSON> said Deputy <PERSON> Idris </PERSON> <PERSON> Arikan </PERSON> was detained and will appear at a hearing on Thursday. <PERSON> Arikan </PERSON> allegedly shot <PERSON> Abdurrezzak </PERSON> <PERSON> Ceylan </PERSON>, who died while undergoing surgery on the chest wound. The semi-official <ORGANIZATION> Anatolia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> agency said a ballistic report indicated the bullet was fired from <PERSON> Arikan </PERSON>'s gun. But <PERSON> Arikan </PERSON> issued a statement saying that <PERSON> Ceylan </PERSON>, a member of the <ORGANIZATION> True </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Path </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, was shot by another deputy, <PERSON> Zeki </PERSON> <PERSON> Celiker </PERSON>, an independent. `` I drew my gun to protect myself.

Two reporters, <PERSON> Kenan </PERSON> <PERSON> Harunoglu </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Anatolia </ORGANIZATION> reporter <PERSON> Ismail </PERSON> <PERSON> Bezgin </PERSON> said they heard the shooting. `` I saw <PERSON> Ceylan </PERSON> on the floor bleeding and <PERSON> Arikan </PERSON> walking around with a gun in his hand and muttering to himself,'' <PERSON> Bezgin </PERSON> said. No one is allowed to enter Parliament armed, but <PERSON> Halim </PERSON> <PERSON> Aras </PERSON>, deputy speaker of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, said it is not always possible to search deputies for arms. <PERSON> Arikan </PERSON> and Celiker were from the southeastern province of <LOCATION> Siirt </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Ceylan </PERSON>, 37, also was from the province and had been a member of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> since 1983. <ORGANIZATION> Anatolia </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Arikan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Celiker </PERSON> argued over the results of Sunday's local elections in which the <ORGANIZATION> Motherland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> suffered defeats nationwide. The news agency said <PERSON> Arikan </PERSON> held <PERSON> Celiker </PERSON> responsible for his party's defeat in <LOCATION> Siirt </LOCATION>, where the <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrat </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Populist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> won the mayor's race in the provincial capital when rightists' votes were split between <PERSON> Arikan </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Motherland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Ceylan </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> True </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Path </ORGANIZATION> <PERSON> Celiker </PERSON> belonged to True Path before becoming an independent.

 <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> announced Wednesday a review of the investigation that concluded ice on the wings was the probable cause of the 1985 Gander air crash that killed 256 Americans, nearly all of them servicemen heading home for the holidays.

<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 After years of bitter debate, President <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> on Wednesday reopened the <LOCATION> Louvre </LOCATION> as a gleaming, high-tech museum capped by a controversial glass pyramid at the main entrance to the medieval palace. Visitors poured in for their first look at the six-year, $ 850 million overhaul designed by American architect I.M. <PERSON> Pei </PERSON> and still in progress. When renovations are finished in 1993, the centuries-old building will be the world's largest museum. `` The interior of the pyramid is even more extraordinary than the exterior. I think the modernism goes very well with the classical style,'' said <PERSON> Franck </PERSON> <PERSON> Domingue </PERSON>, a Parisian who fought his way inside the museum that is now known as the `` Grand Louvre.'' `` It's light, it's beautiful, it's superb,'' said <PERSON> Martine </PERSON> <PERSON> Bieri-Duminy </PERSON>, who lives nearby and watched the pyramid go up. `` In the beginning, people in the neighborhood were against it. They thought the pyramid would spoil the architecture,'' she said. But now that it is completed, `` it's good for the <LOCATION> Louvre </LOCATION>, it's good for <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, it's good for <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>,'' she said. Visitors who once lost their way in dark, dusty painting galleries on their way to the `` <PERSON> Mona </PERSON> <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON>'' or `` Winged Victory'' are sure to appreciate the spacious and air-conditioned interiors illuminated by skylights. The days of searching for the Louvre's entrance also are over. It's hard to miss the 70-foot transparent pyramid rising gracefully between the museum's two main wings in the center of the <PERSON> Napoleon </PERSON> courtyard. Flanked by three smaller glass pyramids and night-lighted fountains, the pyramid crowns a vast, underground lobby featuring ticket windows, boutiques, an expanded bookstore and a 400-seat auditorium with top-quality acoustics. From there, escalators branch out like the spokes of a wheel, connecting the pyramid to other portions of the museum and reducing the distance visitors once had to trek from one end of the U-shaped Louvre to the other. `` The sense of orientation is the primary concern when redesigning an encyclopedic museum,'' <PERSON> Pei </PERSON> said in an interview. `` The pyramid is the center of gravity, and one radiates from there to the Italian, French and antiquities collections very easily.'' The view from below is breathtaking. The baroque achitecture added to the Louvre in the 19th century looms against the ever-changing <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> skyscape. `` I used to pray for sun,'' <PERSON> Pei </PERSON> said. `` Afterward I realized that the pyramid is even more transparent on a gray day when it takes on the moodiness of the <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> sky.'' The pyramid links visitors to the underground vestiges of the first Louvre castle built by King <PERSON> Philippe </PERSON> <PERSON> Auguste </PERSON> in 1200 as a military stronghold to protect <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> from English invaders. From specially built wooden walkways, visitors can stroll among the restored ruins, including the base of the castle keep and rounded turrets of the thick stone wall that once surrounded it. Remodeled as its royal habitants demanded more comfort and luxury, these vestiges were unearthed during recent excavations under the Cour <PERSON> Carre </PERSON> and are displayed under soft, yellow lighting. Also on display is a history of the Louvre itself, documented by thousands of artifacts dug up in the <PERSON> Napoleon </PERSON> courtyard. They bring to life the daily routines of Parisians over the centuries. Lovers of 15th century and 17th century <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> art will enjoy airy high-ceilinged galleries on the third floor overlooking the Cour <PERSON> Carre </PERSON> and the pyramid. The paintings have been cleaned, reframed and hung at eye-level against gray walls illuminated by skylights. `` This is a gigantic transformation,'' said <PERSON> Pierre </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosenberg </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Louvre </LOCATION>'s head curator of paintings. `` The real issue is creating rooms where one can both learn and enjoy.'' One hundred paintings have been taken out of storage. On view for the first time since 1963 are four mammoth murals by <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Le </PERSON> <PERSON> Brun </PERSON> titled `` L'Histoire d'Alexandre.'' When the Grand Louvre is completed in 1993, it will house 4,000 items, nearly double what it displays today. With 650,000 square feet of additional floor space, hundreds of paintings will have been taken out of storage and shown publicly for the first time. <PERSON> Pei </PERSON>'s pyramid _ in specially manufactured, slightly tinted glass to be cleaned twice a month by Alpine climbers _ was the most controversial aspect of the renovation project initiated by <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON>. `` Five years ago, I had my doubts,'' <PERSON> Pei </PERSON> said. `` Not many people would have bet on this project.'' But <PERSON> Pei </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> held firm, and the tide turned in their favor when a full-size cable model was erected on the spot. `` All through the centuries, the <LOCATION> Louvre </LOCATION> has undergone violent changes,'' <PERSON> Pei </PERSON> said. `` The time had to be right. I was confident because this is the right time.''

 First Lady <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is being treated for a mild eye irritation that has been diagnosed as a thyroid disorder known as Graves Disease, her office said Wednesday. `` Other than mild eye discomfort, Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has felt fine and kept her usual active schedule,'' her press office said in a statement. The statement said Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> sought treatment after `` mild swelling and irritation of the eyes and some loss of weight.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has been taking medication for four days, and has `` noticed marked improvement in her eye symptoms,'' the statement said. <PERSON> Sondra </PERSON> <PERSON> Haley </PERSON>, a press aide to Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, said the condition, which included swelling and watering in her eyes, was `` completely under control.'' `` It's not serious. It was more of an eye irritation,'' Ms. <PERSON> Haley </PERSON> said. The statement said the disease is caused by the production of excess amounts of hormones from the thyroid gland. It said the diagnosis was confirmed by blood tests last Friday at <ORGANIZATION> Walter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> which showed `` slight elevations of two thyroid hormones, thyroxine and triiodothryonine.'' Medical tests on the first lady included a thyroid scan and an electrocardiograph, the statement said. Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is under the care of <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> physicians and an expert in tyroid disorders at <ORGANIZATION> Walter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reed </ORGANIZATION>, the statement said. She has been taking methimazole, a drug that blocks the production of thyroid hormones, the statement said. Grave's disease is a disorder that causes the thyroid gland to over produce the thyroid hormone. The specific cause of the disease is not known, but it is thought to be related to a reaction of the immune system. The symptoms can include an enlarged thyroid gland -LRB- goiter -RRB-, fatigue, heart arrythmias, insomnia, skin conditions and fatigue. Some patients also develop swelling in tissues of the eye, resulting in irritation, pain and light sensitivity. The disease can be controlled by a variety of drugs.

 A former <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official testified at <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s trial Wednesday that in the early frantic search for facts about the Iran-Contra affair, no one bothered to ask the boss _ President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> _ about a possibly illegal 1985 arms shipment to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. `` Did anybody think to ask this man whether he approved the transfer of missiles?'' asked <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s lawyer <PERSON> Brendan </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>, pointing to an easel where he had written in 2-inch-high letters: `` PRES.'' `` The questioning of the president was going to come after we had questioned everybody else,'' said <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON>, a former top aide to then-Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>. <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>'s intense cross-examination of <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> underscored the defense's effort to have the former president appear in court to testify for the former <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> aide. North has subpoenaed <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> but <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Gerhard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> has not ruled whether he will enforce the summons. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s lawyer filed a paper with the court Wednesday insisting that <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s defenders say precisely why they want him as a witness and what questions they will ask. The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> filed court papers seeking to quash <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s subpoena for <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s appearance, suggesting written interrogatories as an alternative. `` Unlike any other citizen, a President and a former President both have a duty to protect the Presidency and to assure that national security and international pece are not compromised unnecessarily,'' said the department. `` Because ... it is he who speaks for the nation, any hurried statement and any answer to a surprise question pose a risk to the nation.'' The department said the court `` should consider whether answers to written interrogatories would provide'' <PERSON> North </PERSON> `` with all of the essential facts necessary to a fair trial.'' The issue of whether <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration officials knew that Hawk missiles were aboard a November 1985 flight to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> was raised at a Nov. 20 1986 White House meeting attended by <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON>, National Security Adviser <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON> and his aide, <PERSON> North </PERSON>; <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> director <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Casey </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> official <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gates </PERSON>, <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> was there for part of the meeting. <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> said the topic was testimony <PERSON> Casey </PERSON> was to give the next day to the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> said <PERSON> North </PERSON> proposed that <PERSON> Casey </PERSON> say no one in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government knew that the shipment contained arms. <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> said he learned after the meeting that Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> remembered hearing about the Hawk shipment a year earlier and telephoned <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> about the discrepancy. After <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> did some follow-up work by talking to people at the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION>, was n't it time to ask <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> about the November 1985 shipment, <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> asked the witness. `` I do n't know whether it was time to do so, but we did not do so,'' <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was asked by the Tower commission what he remembered about the shipment in which U.S.-made Hawks were flown from <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> in an attempt to gain freedom for five American hostages held in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. The commission, headed by former Republican Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tower </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, quoted <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> as saying he objected to the shipment and as a result, the <ORGANIZATION> Hawks </ORGANIZATION> were returned to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. However, in another meeting with the commission, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said he could not remember any meeting or conversation in general about <ORGANIZATION> Hawks </ORGANIZATION> and that he did not recall anything about calling back the missiles. In the filing with the court Wednesday, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> attorney <PERSON> Theodore </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Olson </PERSON> said he wants to know from <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> `` the specific evidence sought by him from the former president'' _ and whether it is information essential for his defense and not available from other `` less intrusive means.'' Under an order issued by <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON>, <PERSON> North </PERSON> submitted to the judge a sealed statement of what testimony he wants from <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. But, <PERSON> Olson </PERSON> said in a filing with the court, he has n't been allowed to see it and therefore ca n't respond. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>, one of the last prosecution witnesses, wound up his testimony Wednesday, his second day on the stand. He was the 25th prosecution witness in the trial, now in its ninth week. It was because of discrepancies over the 1985 shipment, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> authorized <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> on Nov. 21, 1986 to conduct a fact-finding inquiry, which led to the discovery in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION>'s office the next day that <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> arms sale money had been siphoned to help the Contras. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> said he summoned <PERSON> North </PERSON> to his office on Nov. 23, a Sunday. The former attorney general testified that after twice urging <PERSON> North </PERSON> to tell the truth _ the national security aide withheld critical details about the diversion. North is charged with falsely telling <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> that the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> had no involvement with the diversion and that <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, a conduit for the arms, actually determined the amount of money funneled to the Contras. In fact, <PERSON> North </PERSON> and other <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials were directing the secret operation, investigators later determined. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> testified that <PERSON> North </PERSON> did not mention the involvement of co-defendants <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Secord </PERSON> or <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Hakim </PERSON> in the affair. And he acknowledged that <PERSON> North </PERSON> had n't mentioned the role of Swiss-based attorney <PERSON> Willard </PERSON> <PERSON> Zucker </PERSON>, who set up dummy companies for the Iran-Contra operation. The ex-attorney general also said <PERSON> North </PERSON> had n't mentioned how the price of the arms sold to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> had been marked up by 270 percent, with some of the excess going to the Contras. Although the judge has not indicated whether he will direct <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> to comply with a subpoena issued by <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s lawyers _ which would be an unprecedented appearance for a former president _ <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> has made a number of courtroom references to a possible <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> appearance. At one point, he said preparations should be made in the event <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> should appear. And while <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> was testifying, <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> stopped a question about <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s opinion, saying: `` You've asked to have the president here. He's coming, he knows what his views were.'' Whether that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> appearance would be in person or merely on videotape is one of many issues concerning <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> yet to be resolved. Prosecutors already have the former president's answers to written questions and <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> ordered the attorneys Wednesday to say whether they object to providing those to North.

 A judge Wednesday dismissed a murder charge against a man accused of killing a policeman because members of the city's elite anti-drug squad lied to get the search warrant for a drug bust that ended in gunfire. State attorneys said they would appeal the <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> judge's decision and try to have the murder charge against <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewin </PERSON> reinstated. Judge <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Grabau </PERSON> told a packed courtroom that he had no choice but to dimiss the case against <PERSON> Lewin </PERSON>, 33, who was accused of shooting Detective <PERSON> Sherman </PERSON> <PERSON> Griffiths </PERSON> during the Feb. 17, 1988, raid. `` A fair trial is not possible,'' <PERSON> Grabau </PERSON> said. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Commonwealth </ORGANIZATION>'s conduct was egregious ... and the evidence is tainted.'' But Assistant District Attorney <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Leary </PERSON> said his office would continue battling for the case's reinstatement despite the conflicting and fraudulent evidence submitted by prosecutors and detailed in the judge's 30-page ruling. `` We say the lie does n't reach the level of egregiousness the judge believes it does,'' <PERSON> Leary </PERSON> said. `` It's in our interest to go right to the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>.'' <PERSON> Leary </PERSON> said authorities would seek Thursday to keep <PERSON> Lewin </PERSON> in jail without bail while they pursued the case, which has raised questions about whether police routinely lie to obtain search warrants. Defense attorneys have said the case proves a pattern of police abuse in obtaining search warrants and could result in new trials for dozens of convicted drug dealers who were arrested after possibly illegal searches. But <PERSON> Leary </PERSON> said his office set little store by the case's broader implications. `` I'm fighting to have this case reinstated,'' <PERSON> Leary </PERSON> said. `` I'm not too concerned about any other cases. The slain detective's family condemned the judge's ruling, charging him with making a `` gutless'' decision. `` We are devastated and outraged by the judge's ruling,'' said the victim's brother, <PERSON> Tommy </PERSON> <PERSON> Griffiths </PERSON>. <PERSON> Griffiths </PERSON>, a 36-year-old member of the police department's elite <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Unit </ORGANIZATION>, was trying to break into an apartment in the city's <LOCATION> Dorchester </LOCATION> section when <PERSON> Lewin </PERSON> allegedly fired a bullet through the door and killed him. Officers had obtained a search warrant based on testimony by an informant named <PERSON> John </PERSON>. <PERSON> Grabau </PERSON> dismissed the case last month after detectives failed to produce <PERSON> John </PERSON> in court, saying they could not find him. Further, <PERSON> Lewin </PERSON> did not match the search warrant's description of the cocaine dealer police had sought Last week, the detectives admitted lying about the existence of <PERSON> John </PERSON>, who they said was actually a composite of two other informants. The judge agreed to consider reinstating the murder charge against <PERSON> Lewin </PERSON> after the detectives submitted affidavits clarifying the informants' joint role in the arrest. On Wednesday <PERSON> Grabau </PERSON> said a fair trial was not possible. The `` pattern of misconduct from the date of the tragic death ... to the present has been pervasive, egregious, deliberate and intentional,'' he said. Assistant District Attorney <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Meara </PERSON> has argued the detectives lied to protect their sources from vengeful drug dealers and to increase their chances of getting a search warrant. But <PERSON> Max </PERSON> <PERSON> Stern </PERSON>, <PERSON> Lewin </PERSON>'s defense attorney, said the explanation did not excuse the detectives' repeatedly fraudulent actions. `` It was not a lie. It was hundreds of lies,'' <PERSON> Stern </PERSON> said. `` And in an effort to reinstate the case, it was just more lies.'' Three detectives, <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Luna </PERSON>, 32, <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON> <PERSON> Amate </PERSON>, 31, and <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Schroeder </PERSON>, 33, have been suspended with pay while under investigation by <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Attorney General <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Shannon </PERSON> for perjury.

<TEXT>
 The opposition and the government will not meet their Monday target date for concluding talks on political and economic reforms and legalizing Solidarity, <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>, chairman of the banned independent union movement, and Interior Minister Gen. <PERSON> Czeslaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Kiszczak </PERSON> decided after a 12-hour meeting Wednesday that April 5 is the earliest possible date for a final agreement in the 8-week-old round-table talks. `` It is going quite difficultly, but it is not hopeless,'' <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> said early Thursday as he returned to <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> from the talks in a government residence south of the capital. `` We are moving slowly toward the end, although there are some hard subjects,'' he said. `` We agreed on 80 percent'' of the problems. <PERSON> Kiszczak </PERSON> and <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> could meet again early next week, Solidarity advisers indicated. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> and about a dozen advisers looked discouraged as they got off a small bus in front of the headquarters of the <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> episcopate. An official statement on the meeting, issued by the state-run <ORGANIZATION> PAP </ORGANIZATION> news agency, said <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kiszczak </PERSON> `` agreed that the working teams will continue work so as to hold the final round-table plenary conference on April 5.'' The talks, which began Feb. 6, were scheduled to have their last working-group sessions on Thursday, and the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> was to meet Friday on ratifying the agreement. But the results of the meeting between <PERSON> Kiszczak </PERSON> and <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> left doubts on whether the agreement would be ready by then. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kiszczak </PERSON> said earlier they wanted to sign the final accord at a plenary session of the negotiators on April 3. Solidarity adviser <PERSON> Bronislaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Geremek </PERSON> said the opposition side spent the Easter weekend studying written agreements reached so far but that some problems remained in the areas of politics, the economy and trade unions. The general outlines of the far-reaching agreement were reached some time ago. In exchange for legalization of Solidarity _ outlawed after the martial-law crackdown of 1981 _ and other opposition groups, the opposition would agree to participate in <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> elections in June that would guarantee the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and its allies 65 percent of the 460 seats. A presidency and a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> of about 100 members would be created. The opposition would be expected to win the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, which would be picked in a completely open, democratic popular vote. The <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> would be expected to get the presidency, elected jointly by the <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, owing to the party's strength in the larger Parliament. In addition, the opposition would have access to the mass media, including a daily newspaper and two weeklies and at least one program on national TV and radio. In economic reforms, authorities would agree to a formula of indexing workers' wages to compensate for <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s unabating inflation, more than 60 percent last year. Authorities agreed to the talks in August during the year's second nationwide wave of crippling industrial strikes Officials have expressed hope that agreement with the opposition will provide political and labor stability so that economic reforms have time to work. They also hope that the accord will help persuade the West to invest in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and help the country finance its $ 39 billion foreign debt. Among the difficulties that remain in the talks are the opposition's demand that all workers dismissed for Solidarity-related activities in the past be rehired, the details of the formula of wage indexation, and differences on the size and the powers of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and the powers of the new presidency.

 Federal authorities have smashed a billion-dollar international operation laundering drug money and forced <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> cartel to alter the way it handles drug profits, the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday. Attorney General <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> Director <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sessions </PERSON> and other top law enforcement officials said their `` Operation Polar Cap'' has ended with charges against 127 people and two Latin American banks. Most of the charges related to cocaine possession and distribution and money laund ering. But Justice officials said one of the defendants, <PERSON> Eduardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON>, eluded capture in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> by the Panamanian <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> after he holed up in a bank there Wednesday. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> authorities had relied on the defense forces for assistance, despite the fact it is headed by Panamianian Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, who is himself under a federal indictment for drug trafficking. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Saphos </PERSON>, chief of the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s narcotics and dangerous drug section, said the Panamanian <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> had detained <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON>'s private plane that he had flown to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> as well as his pilots are are `` hoping he'll come back'' so they can arrest him. <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> called the investigation `` the largest money-laundering crackdown ever carried out by the federal government.'' Agents seized a half ton of cocaine and $ 45 million in cash, jewels and real estate, and filed civil actions in an effort to seize as much as $ 412 million more in assets of the banks, <ORGANIZATION> Banco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> de </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Occidente </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Banco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> de </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Occidente </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>, that are deposited in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bank accounts. The operation, reaching across the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> into <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and to <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, had direct ties to the <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> drug cartel of <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> and laundered $ 1.2 billion over two years, <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials said. The cartel is responsible for as much as 80 percent of the cocaine flowing into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, according to federal drug officials. `` There is no more effective way to deal with the business of drug traffickig than to take the profit out of it. That's what has happened with Operation Polar Cap,'' <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> said at a news conference. `` I think it's fair to describe this operation as a very hostile takeover of a major money laundering operation,'' he said. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials said the laundering operation played a significant role in the handling of the cartel's illegal drug proceeds and was known within the drug world as `` La Mina,'' or `` The Mine.'' Agents learned of the ring while operating an undercover money-laundering operation of their own in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> as part of a joint investigation by federal agencies, including the <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>. Authorities said that undercover agents received complaints from alleged drug-world figures that they were moving too slowly in their laundering, or processing the money into seemingly legitimate accounts. The agents were told <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mina </ORGANIZATION> could get the money by wire from <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> within 48 hours, according to court documents released with the indictments. Federal agents then expanded their investigation into that operation, using electronic intercepts, surveillance and pursuit of financial paper trails. <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> said that while it is difficult to determine how much impact the federal action will have on the <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> cartel, `` common sense tells me when you disrupt an operation that has laundered over a billion dollars in two years, you're going to force some adjustment in their operation.'' <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> administrator <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawn </PERSON> said that one indication of the effect was seen immediately by drug agents. When <PERSON> La </PERSON> <PERSON> Mina </PERSON> was forced out of business, he said, `` the phone was ringing off the hook'' at the undercover money-laundering operation that was continuing in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, with requests for use of their services. The <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> agents were so busy they laundered $ 4 million in three days, he said. `` If there were other facilities within the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for the laundering of money, they would not have come back to a minor money-laundering operation that was causing them trouble with getting their money moved quickly,'' <PERSON> Lawn </PERSON> said. Arrests began in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> in February, where federal agents charged that large amounts of money was being laundered through jewelry dealers who allegedly used phony gold shipments to cover the transactions. <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> told reporters during a luncheon meeting in his private dining room that <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>, was holed up in a bank in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> that was surrounded by Panamanian Defense Forces. He had been scheduled to meet with undercover agents in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> on Wednesday. However, later in the afternoon <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> somehow managed to escape from the bank, said <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Pagel </PERSON>, a trial attorney with the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s narcotics section. `` I do n't know what the logistics were,'' <PERSON> Pagel </PERSON> said. `` The last information I had was he was not in custody and ... they are not expecting to take him into custody at the moment.'' Lawn said the Panamanian forces had continued to cooperate with <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> despite <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s indictment. `` Obviously, they are circumspect in dealing with them,'' <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> said of <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION>. `` These are not naive individuals. On the other hand, they're faced with the necessity of having to deal with law enforcement in Central and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, and I assume they're doing the best they can. <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> is described in the indictment as an associate and agent of <PERSON> Geraldo </PERSON> <PERSON> Moncada </PERSON>, whom the government accused of organizing, supervising and managing for the <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> cartel the importation, sale and distribution of cocaine in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, and in particular, in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said that among the indictments resulting from the investigation were charges against 29 people unsealed in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> and eight people arrested Tuesday evening in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Federal agents were seizing accounts at banks in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco-San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jose </LOCATION> area, the department said. An indictment charges that the general manager of <ORGANIZATION> Banco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> de </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Occidente </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Guarin </PERSON>, and other bank officers authorized the use of the bank to accept wire transfers on behalf of the cartel. <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> said there was no evidence of illegal activity by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> banks, and that the banks cooperated in the investigation.

<HEAD>Police Search For Missing Man With $33 Million</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SYDNEY, Australia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Police issued an international alert for an executive who vanished with $ 33 million in cash and left the country's largest search and rescue operation near collapse, authorities said Wednesday. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Friedrich </PERSON>, head of the non-profit <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, made headlines nationwide when he disappeared late last week. Australian media said he apparently had no passport, was not listed on voter rolls and did not have a social security number. Police said they were not sure if <PERSON> Friedrich </PERSON> was the man's real name. His wife, <PERSON> Shirley </PERSON>, pleaded on national television for her husband to `` come home and clear up this mess.'' Prime Minister <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Hawke </PERSON> on Wednesday said there was no evidence <PERSON> Friedrich </PERSON>, 44, had any links with overseas intelligence services, as suggested in news reports. `` There have been so many fanciful claims made, including that this missing person is a <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> agent,'' <PERSON> Hawke </PERSON> said. `` I've had all these things checked out, and I'm assured there is no substance in these things.'' Federal police said <ORGANIZATION> Interpol </ORGANIZATION>, the Paris-based international police network, was on the alert for <PERSON> Friedrich </PERSON> after he was reported seen in <LOCATION> Auckland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION>, and in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. `` We've got no solid evidence as to whether he's alive or dead, or if he's in <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> or has fled the country,'' a police spokeswoman said on condition of anonymity. `` He just vanished.'' The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> was founded in 1927 and is based in the state of <LOCATION> Victoria </LOCATION>. Aside from the military, it is the country's largest search and rescue organization with 29 airplanes and helicopters But the council has debts of $ 180 million, and the government has refused to bail it out. Police said the organization's debts were not the result of criminal activity by the council. Newspapers said <PERSON> Friedrich </PERSON> duped banks in <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> and overseas into providing loans based on false invoices for equipment that was supposed to serve as collateral. The reports detailed how <PERSON> Friedrich </PERSON> engineered the phenomenal growth of the council, transforming it from a one-aircraft operation into an organization with 450 employees. Questions were raised as far back as 1975 about the search and rescue operation's finances, according to reports. Aides said <PERSON> Friedrich </PERSON> always sent a deputy to board meetings in his place and arranged for couriers to deliver financial documents at the last minute so they would be signed without much study. Board president <PERSON> Max </PERSON> <PERSON> Eise </PERSON> said in an interview with the <ORGANIZATION> Sydney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morning </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION> newspaper that <PERSON> Friedrich </PERSON> once lied about where he was born and then said, `` I'm a non-person.'' Some politicians have called for a <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inquiry </ORGANIZATION>, the highest form of investigation, into <PERSON> Friedrich </PERSON>'s activities following police reports that he might be an illegal immigrant. A police spokesman who spoke on condition of anonymity said an investigation was hampered by conflicting dates on <PERSON> Friedrich </PERSON>'s credentials, including his marriage certificate <PERSON> Friedrich </PERSON> received the Order of <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>, the country's highest award, last year. A spokesman for Governor General <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Hayden </PERSON> said Wednesday he could be stripped of the honor if it is found he is not an Australian citizen.

 State Treasurer <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Manchin </PERSON>, one of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>'s most popular political figures, was impeached Wednesday for losing $ 279 million in state funds through bad investments. The state <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Delegates </ORGANIZATION> voted 65-34 to approve 17 articles of impeachment against <PERSON> Manchin </PERSON>, whom Delegate <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Bird </PERSON> called `` the most popular man in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>.'' The vote sends the case to the state <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Tucker </PERSON> said a three - four-week trial on the treasurer's removal probably will be held in late Earlier, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> voted 39-60 against a move to censure and publicly reprimand the 61-year-old Democrat, a lesser rebuke favored by <PERSON> Manchin </PERSON>'s supporters. The House did approve the censure of state Auditor <PERSON> Glen </PERSON> <PERSON> Gainer </PERSON> for his role in the losses, the bulk of which occurred from April to June of 1987. <PERSON> Manchin </PERSON> and Gainer serve with the governor on the <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investments </ORGANIZATION>, which supervises investments managed by the treasurer's office. `` When you consider the leadership of the House ... that's behind all of this, and how they've been twisting arms and pushing, I'm not surprised at the outcome of this vote,'' <PERSON> Manchin </PERSON> said `` I have committed no wrong. I'm going to stay around as long as I can.'' One of <PERSON> Manchin </PERSON>'s supporters, Delegate <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON>, referring to <PERSON> Manchin </PERSON>'s popularity, said voters `` know he's not a financial genius. What they do know is he is a leader.'' <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> said <PERSON> Manchin </PERSON> would fight the attempt to oust him. <PERSON> Manchin </PERSON> testified during 10 days of hearings before the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> that he knew little about investments. He said he was betrayed by subordinates he hired to run the consolidated investment fund that lost the $ 279 million. The committee approved the articles of impeachment Monday. Delegate <PERSON> Marc </PERSON> <PERSON> Harman </PERSON>, a Republican who headed the impeachment move, said the evidence against <PERSON> Manchin </PERSON> met the state constitutional standard of impeachment for `` maladministration, incompetency, neglect of duty, and high crimes and misdemeanors.'' The articles specifically charge <PERSON> Manchin </PERSON> with failing to supervise the fund, delegating his power and authority, making improper investments, paying out funds that were not earned, and covering up the losses. `` Delegation does not mean abdication,'' <PERSON> Harman </PERSON> argued. `` You simply can not delegate to the point where you have no responsibility.'' If convicted by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Manchin </PERSON> would be removed from office and would be ineligible to run again. A conviction also would likely lead to the loss of his pension, estimated to be at least $ 2,128 a month. The last time a <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> treasurer was impeached and removed from office was in 1876. <PERSON> Manchin </PERSON>, who has spent 40 years in state government, was first elected state treasurer in 1984 and was re-elected last fall.

<HEAD>Alaskan Oil Tragedy Revives Bitter Memories Of Santa Barbara Spill</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Tanker Spill, Bjt</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The oil that is defiling Alaskan waters has revived painful memories for those who saw the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> coast blackened by greasy sludge 20 years ago in a calamity that helped spawn the environmental movement. `` It's the same thing all over again, only on an even larger scale,'' said lawyer-environmentalist <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Hopps </PERSON>, who was a high school senior when the <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Barbara </LOCATION> oil spill occurred on Jan. 28, 1969. `` The message is you can not trust the oil companies. You can not believe their representations regarding the safety of oil operations,'' <PERSON> Hopps </PERSON> said Wednesday by phone from <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Barbara </LOCATION>, where he recently ended his term as president of Get Oil Out, or GOO, which was formed after the spill. About 10.1 million gallons of oil have flowed into <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>'s once-pristine Prince <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sound </PERSON> in the nation's worst oil spill, which happened when the supertanker <PERSON> Exxon </PERSON> <PERSON> Valdez </PERSON> ran onto a reef Friday The <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Barbara </LOCATION> spill occurred because of the blowout of an improperly cased well on an offshore drilling platform operated by <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coastal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, marking the 20th anniversary of the spill, recalled that it `` spewed more than 3.25 million gallons of oil over 800 square miles of water, covered 100 miles of coastline and beaches with a thick tarry black goo, smothered thousands of birds, fish and other sea life, and helped trigger a new age of environmental awareness.'' A spokesman for Union _ now <ORGANIZATION> Unocal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> _ has disputed those statistics, contending that only 30 miles of coastline were affected by a spill of no more than 840,000 gallons. However, the <ORGANIZATION> Western </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> States </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> has said at least 2.1 million gallons spilled. <ORGANIZATION> Unocal </ORGANIZATION>, which paid about $ 16 million in settlements as a result of spill-related lawsuits, also disputes claims that oil still leaks from the spill site. It says the leakage is the result of natural oil seepage from the sea floor. <ORGANIZATION> Unocal </ORGANIZATION> and other oil companies still drill for oil off <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Barbara </LOCATION>. In 1969, there were 10 oil platforms in <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Barbara </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Channel </LOCATION>; at the beginning of this year there were 22, with applications pending for six more. The petroleum association said the environment has recovered from the <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Barbara </LOCATION> accident, which spurred the oil industry to institute safer technology and tougher controls for oil drilling and production. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Neushul </PERSON>, a biology professor at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Barbara </LOCATION>, agreed that, based on limited studies, the spill `` was n't an ecological disaster.'' He said that the <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Barbara </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Channel </LOCATION> appears to have recovered from the deaths of at least 9,000 birds, 8.8 million barnacles, 30,000 mussels and 51,800 limpets. However, <PERSON> Hopps </PERSON>, commenting earlier this year on the 20th anniversary of the spill, sharply disagreed. `` If that was not an ecological disaster, there is no such thing as an ecological disaster,'' he said. <PERSON> Neushul </PERSON> said studies in <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Barbara </LOCATION> have not proved that the fishing industry there was harmed. However, he said the result may be different in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, where salmon spawning areas could be badly damaged. The Alaskan accident will bolster environmentalists because it highlights `` the now-familiar ineptitude of the oil companies and government agencies responsible for environmental protection,'' <PERSON> Neushul </PERSON> said. The latest spill made him think, `` God, how can these -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- people be so stupid?'' <PERSON> Neushul </PERSON> said. `` The key to oil spills is do n't spill it in the first place.'' <PERSON> Hopps </PERSON> said memories of the 1969 accident `` are almost constantly there _ like a nightmare one expects to live with the rest of their life.'' `` I saw hundreds of birds covered with oil head to toe, some already dead, others dying. ... I remember beaches inches thick with oil. And I remember for years afterward swimming in the ocean and getting tar and oil on my body.'' <PERSON> Lois </PERSON> <PERSON> Sidenberg </PERSON>, a GOO co-founder who now is the group's vice president, said when she learned of the Alaskan oil spill, `` the first thing I thought of was getting a Scotch Old Fashioned.'' She remembered that in 1969, `` when you went down to the shore and looked, all you could do was cry. It was such a devastation of a beautiful area.'' Alaskans should `` get on the president and tell him not to permit any expansion of oil development,'' <PERSON> Sidenberg </PERSON> said. Asked what he would say to Alaskans about their spill, <PERSON> Hopps </PERSON> replied: `` It's like asking somebody who's lost a loved one what you want to share with somebody under similar circumstances. They have my sympathy and my understanding, but the deed is done.''

 Investigators used gardening tools and metal detectors Wednesday to search woods where the bodies of seven women have been found since last summer. Police and a search dog discovered the seventh body Tuesday in <LOCATION> Freetown </LOCATION>, and District Attorney <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pina </PERSON> said it certainly was related to the other corpses uncovered in the area, which is centered around a highway intersection. Superior Court Judge <PERSON> Courtland </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mathers </PERSON> granted on Tuesday Pina's request to extend a grand jury investigation into the deaths of the women. The first six, whose skeletal remains were found between July and December last year, had been involved in prostitution or drugs in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bedford </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Weld </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION> area, according to family members and police. Investigators identified the seventh body Wednesday as <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> Rhodes </PERSON>, 29, who had been missing from the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bedford </LOCATION> area for about a year. <PERSON> Pina </PERSON> said <PERSON> Rhodes </PERSON> had a history of heroin addiction, but no record for prostitution. A forensic expert said the six women died between October 1987 and April 1988. Three more <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bedford </LOCATION> women have been missing for more than a year. A police dog searched the area where the last body was found last fall, but was distracted by the scents from several reporters and cameramen in the area and the search was called off, police said. Police resumed searching with dogs on Monday because the weather was warmer and state police believed the area merited further examination. `` Information from our investigation indicated that we needed to be out and searching those areas again,'' <PERSON> Pina </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> said. Police Detective <PERSON> Gardner </PERSON> <PERSON> Greany </PERSON> said investigators were searching for items the killer, or killers, may have stepped on and pushed into the ground. `` The killer could have stepped on a piece of metal, a key or something ... and it might be helpful,'' <PERSON> Greany </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Pina </PERSON> obtained a subpoena forcing <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ponte </PERSON>, a lawyer who investigators say knew at least three victims, to appear before the grand jury earlier this month. Police have charged a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bedford </LOCATION> man with three roadside sexual assaults that allegedly occurred in the area of the slayings. The man, <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, is free on $ 15,000 cash bail pending trial. Police will not say whether either <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> or Ponte is suspected in the slayings. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> said investigators were `` not in a position to request an indictment'' at this time.

 Three men were convicted Wednesday in the exeuction-style murder of a rookie policeman whose death became an issue in last year's presidential campaign and helped set the national agenda in the war on drugs. <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Cobb </PERSON>, 25, was convicted of second-degree murder and weapons charges for his role in the death of Officer <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrne </PERSON>, who was shot five times while he sat in his patrol car guarding the home of a witness in a drug case. About two hours later, a second jury convicted <PERSON> Todd </PERSON> <PERSON> Scott </PERSON>, 20, and <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Copeland </PERSON>, 23 of the same charges. Two juries were required because <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> and <PERSON> Cobb </PERSON> implicated one another in videotaped statements made after their arrests. The verdicts from both juries were met by cheers and applause in the courtroom from police officers and friends and family of the slain officer. <PERSON> Byrne </PERSON>'s shooting became an issue in the presidential election when his father, <PERSON> Matthew </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrne </PERSON>, presented then-Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> with his son's police shield. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who said it was the most emotional moment of the campaign for him, showed the shield to audiences around the country when he spoke about the need to crack down on illegal drugs. <PERSON> Cobb </PERSON> shook his head listlessly as he listened to the jury announce its verdict after two days of deliberations in state court. <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> and <PERSON> Copeland </PERSON>, who grinned as his verdict was read, both told reporters, `` I'll be back,'' as they were escorted from the courtroom. Queens District Attorney <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Santucci </PERSON> hugged and congratulated <PERSON> Matthew </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrne </PERSON>, a former police officer who is now a lawyer. The defendants each face a maximum sentence of 25 years to life on the murder charges and five to 15 years on second-degree criminal possession of a weapon. Judge <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Demakos </PERSON> set sentencing for Cobb on April 24 and for <PERSON> Copeland </PERSON> and <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> on April 25. <PERSON> Cobb </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Fishman </PERSON>, said he would file an appeal after sentencing. Prosecutors charged that the three defendants, along with another man, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> McClary </PERSON>, executed <PERSON> Byrne </PERSON> on directions issued from <LOCATION> Rikers </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> by jailed drug lord <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> `` Pappy'' <PERSON> Mason </PERSON>. <PERSON> Byrne </PERSON>, 22, was shot at point-blank range as he sat alone in a parked police car in a drug-riddled <LOCATION> Queens </LOCATION> neighborhood early the morning of Feb. 26, 1988. Prosecutors said <PERSON> Mason </PERSON> ordered the slaying in retaliation for his conviction and imprisonment on a weapons charge earlier the same week. `` It was a declaration of war against our society and a message: ` Oppose us and die,''' Assistant District Attorney <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirke </PERSON> <PERSON> Bartley </PERSON> said in his closing argument Monday. The trial began on what would have been <PERSON> Byrne </PERSON>'s 23rd birthday. <PERSON> Byrne </PERSON> was guarding the home of <PERSON> Arjune </PERSON>, a drug-case witness who lived in the crack-ravaged neighborhood. Police assigned 24-hour protection to the Guyanese immigrant's home after drug dealers firebombed it in an effort to intimidate him. <PERSON> Arjune </PERSON>, who is now in the federal witness protection program, testified that he saw <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> and <PERSON> Cobb </PERSON> from his bedroom window just minutes after hearing five gunshots on the street below. Other prosecution witnesses detailed a meeting in a <LOCATION> Queens </LOCATION> kitchen where the killing was planned, while a former drug addict-prostitute, <PERSON> Rachel </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>, placed all three defendants in the area of <PERSON> Byrne </PERSON>'s car when he was killed. <PERSON> Cobb </PERSON> and <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> both took the witness stand in their own defense. Each admitted they were there when <PERSON> Byrne </PERSON> was killed but denied any involvement in its planning or execution. The fourth defendant, <PERSON> McClary </PERSON>, 22, will be tried later. <PERSON> Scott </PERSON>, an admitted drug dealer, identified him as <PERSON> Byrne </PERSON>'s killer during testimony. In the wake of <PERSON> Byrne </PERSON>'s slaying, police established the Tactical Narcotics Team, or TNT, which established a heavy police presence in the area. <ORGANIZATION> TNT </ORGANIZATION> has since been extended to other drug-riddled neighborhoods.

 Ten thousand riot police firing tear gas stormed the Hyundai shipyard before dawn Thursday and battled striking workers who had been occupying parts of the sprawling facility for three months, police said. Police fired hundreds of tear gas shells before charging the yard at <LOCATION> Ulsan </LOCATION> on the coast about 150 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>, according to <ORGANIZATION> Yonhap </ORGANIZATION>, the national news agency. Riot police in green combat fatigues and visored helmets knocked down barricades erected by the strikers at the country's biggest shipyard, it said. About 1,000 of the attacking police used boats to get into the shipyard from the sea. Police officials said about 200 strikers were arrested and 700 more strikers were surrounded by riot troopers in a company dormitory. At least one police officer was injured, the officials said. `` Why are police using force to stop our right to strike? We have been trying to talk to management, but there has been no response,'' one of the strikers said in a TV interview aired on the Korean Broadcasting System. The government ordered police to end the strike by militant workers who had repeatedly stalled operations at the shipyard. Senior government ministers in a meeting in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> on Wednesday ordered police to occupy the shipyard. About 1,000 militant members of an independent labor union had been staging protests at the yard, which employs about 22,000 workers. Strikers are demanding higher pay and recognition of their union. The government intervened after repeated requests from <ORGANIZATION> Hyundai </ORGANIZATION>. Authorities deployed 14,000 riot police around the shipyard and started to move in after midnight. Some strikers left the shipyard as police began blocking the main gates. Hundreds of strikers wearing construction helmets and armed with iron bars held off police for about five hours by threatening to ignite a pile of 60 propane gas containers. Some strikers were armed with homemade flame throwers made from welding kits, but police said they were not used. Strikers set fire to two of the propane gas tanks when police attacked, but troopers put out the fire with a fire engine and there was no explosion, police said. President <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> <PERSON> Tae-woo </PERSON>'s government has warned it will deal severely with militant workers who have staged a series of often violent strikes. The government had urged companies to settle labor disputes peacefully without official interference. But government officials now fear the strikes will damage the national economy. <ORGANIZATION> Hyundai </ORGANIZATION> has refused to recognize the militant union, and clashes broke out previously at the <LOCATION> Ulsan </LOCATION> yard between strikers and pro-management workers. The company said the protests were costing up to $ 6 million a day in lost business. Korean news reports said most workers at the shipyard wanted to work.

<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is willing to help the leftist Nicaraguan government if its members hold free elections 1990 and still retain power, <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> Deane </PERSON> <PERSON> Hinton </PERSON> said Wednesday. `` We are willing to help them economically,'' <PERSON> Hinton </PERSON> said at a news conference. `` The new administration of President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is ready to give more carrots instead of sticks.'' <PERSON> Hinton </PERSON>'s comments seemed to go much further than any the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration has made so far on Central American policy. The administration, in its public statements, has not been specific about rewards it would offer <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s Sandinista government if it lives up to its promises of democratization. Privately, however, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> holds out the prospect of economic aid and normal relations if the country meets its commitment, including holding free and fair elections next February. Despite his comments, <PERSON> Hinton </PERSON> said the Nicaraguan government remains the major obstacle to peace in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> `` because the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> keep supplying weapons to the Salvadoran rebels.'' <PERSON> Hinton </PERSON> also said the aid package <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has proposed for the rebels opposed to the Nicaraguan government would not endanger the peace accords signed by the five <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> presidents on Feb. 14. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on Friday announced a bipartisan accord that would allot $ 45 million in non-military to the rebels, known as the Contras. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> still must approve the aid, which would end next February. Nicaraguan President <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> has said the proposal violates the Central American peace accords. <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> and the presidents of <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION> have agreed to come up with a plan by mid-May to disband the Contra force, now living in Honduran border camps. An estimated 11,000 Contra fighters and their family members have lived in the camps since the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government cut off military aid in February 1988. <ORGANIZATION> Nicarguan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> sources in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jose </LOCATION>, speaking on condition of anonymity, told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday that Nicarguan Foreign Minister <PERSON> Miguel </PERSON> <PERSON> Descoto </PERSON> will denounce the Contra aid proposal when he meets with fellow Central American foreign ministers in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jose </LOCATION> on Thursday and Friday. The foreign ministers are to discuss progress made since the Feb. 14 accords and the Contra aid proposal. Guatemalan Foreign Minister <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Palencia </PERSON> arrived in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jose </LOCATION> on Wednesday and told the <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> he did not believe <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid would hurt the accords. `` We are sure the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government is working in good faith to support a peaceful solution to the Central American crisis,'' he said in an airport interview. `` The new humanitarian aid for the Nicaraguan Resistance is not an intervention.''

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Blier </PERSON>, one of the most enduring and versatile actors in <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> cinema, died Wednesday night at the age of 73, his son, film director <PERSON> Bertrand </PERSON> <PERSON> Blier </PERSON>, announced. He said his father died in the <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> suburb of St. Cloud after a long illness. On March 4, <PERSON> Blier </PERSON> received a Cesar award, the French equivalent of an Oscar, honoring the body of his work _ about 150 films in a career that spanned more than half a century. The formerly rotund actor appeared weakened and thin as he accepted the award. In his lengthy career, <PERSON> Blier </PERSON> played nearly every type of role. From his first film in 1937, <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Rouleau </PERSON>'s `` Trois, Six, Neuf'' -LRB- Three, Six, Nine -RRB-, followed by six other movies that same year, <PERSON> Blier </PERSON> was rarely without work. He made his last movie in 1988, <PERSON> Moshe </PERSON> <PERSON> Mizrahi </PERSON>'s `` Mangeclous.'' `` My work is my joie de vivre,'' <PERSON> Blier </PERSON> once said. `` Never do I go to the studio like one goes to an office.'' Born on Jan. 11, 1916, in <LOCATION> Buenos </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aires </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>, where his biologist father was on assignment for the <ORGANIZATION> Pasteur </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Blier </PERSON> even as a child longed to act. He studied at one point under the actor <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Jouvet </PERSON>, who reportedly told him: `` You'll start your career at the age of 50.'' <PERSON> Blier </PERSON> captured the public's eye and scored his first real success with two movies made just after World War II: `` Quai des Orfevres'' by <PERSON> Henri-Georges </PERSON> <PERSON> Clouzot </PERSON> and <PERSON> Yves </PERSON> <PERSON> Allegres </PERSON>' `` Dede d'Anvers.'' Among <PERSON> Blier </PERSON>'s most notable films were `` Hotel du Nord'' -LRB- North Hotel -RRB- directed by <PERSON> Marcel </PERSON> <PERSON> Carne </PERSON> -LRB- 1938 -RRB-; `` Avant le Deluge'' -LRB- Before the Deluge -RRB- by <PERSON> Andre </PERSON> <PERSON> Cayatte </PERSON> -LRB- 1953 -RRB-, and `` Calmos'' and `` Buffet Froid,'' made in 1975 and 1979, respectively, under the direction of his son. <PERSON> Blier </PERSON> also made about 30 movies in <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>.

 Torrential rains swept across eastern <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> on Wednesday, bursting an earthen dam and causing widespread flooding. There was flooding in northern <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, where melting snow filled rivers to overflowing. In the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION>, heavy snow fell from northeastern <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> to northern <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>. Eleven inches of snow fell at <LOCATION> Petersburg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.D. </LOCATION>. A low-pressure system that moved from south central to eastern <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> produced powerful showers and thunderstorms, dumping heavy rains overnight from eastern <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> into <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION> Over 14 inches of rain fell in 24 hours at <LOCATION> Longview </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, about 60 miles west of <LOCATION> Shreveport </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> La </LOCATION>. More than 12 inches fell at <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Chalk </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, and more than five inches at <LOCATION> Texarkana </LOCATION>, Ark. An earthen dam burst at <LOCATION> Nix </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION>, near <LOCATION> Henderson </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, and the floodwaters pushed a car off <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Highway 43, killing a man. Other people were left stranded in trees until rescuers arrived in boats. Numerous roads were closed across northeast <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> due to high water. Across the border in <LOCATION> Texarkana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ark. </LOCATION>, some homes had 2 feet of water inside and cars were washed off roads. As the thunderstorms moved eastward into <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>, between 2 and 3 inches of rain fell near the <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>. Winds damaged a house and toppled trees at <LOCATION> Vicksburg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Miss. </LOCATION>, and similar damage was reported elsewhere across <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>. Flash flood watches were posted from <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>. Six counties in north-central <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> declared states of emergency as rivers topped their banks and runoff from melting snow washed out roads. A flood watch also was posted for areas of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> state </LOCATION> <LOCATION> east </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ontario </LOCATION>, where rainfall and melting snow were expected to cause streams and rivers to overflow, as well as in parts of northern <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>. Rainfall also was expected to move into western <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> and cause rivers to rise. A river flood watch was posted for Thursday and Friday along the <LOCATION> Allegheny </LOCATION>, Clarion and upper <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> rivers. Rain fell across much of the lower <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>. In the West, rain showers and snow showers were scattered over the northern Intermountain region. Warm weather continued along the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION>. Temperatures climbed into the 80s from the <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> to the middle and southern <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> states.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION>, finally rid of its bats, turned its attention Wednesday to 100 stray cats. Many of the felines, frequently pregnant, have been there since the early 1970s, living on handouts and hunting mice and birds. The biggest concern over proliferating kitties is the continuing fear that they'll give people rabies. Animal advocates do n't agree, saying rabies in cats is extremely rare. But administrators feared a cat bite could bring legal action and considered extermination. Caring students resisted, perhaps remembering tabbies back home. School attorney <PERSON> Ashmun </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> met Wednesday with <ORGANIZATION> Humane </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> Director <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Andrews </PERSON> and <PERSON> Heather </PERSON> <PERSON> Harden </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> UCF </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Campus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Animals </ORGANIZATION>, formed a month ago. They drafted a plan to capture the cats, find them homes, and get them temporary lodging. `` I'm praying that we can finally get moving on this,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Hardin </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> UCF </ORGANIZATION> junior majoring in anthropology. `` These animals have suffered long enough.'' Ms. <PERSON> Hardin </PERSON> negotiated agreements with area veterinarians to provide free vaccination and sterilization, and her group compiled a list of potential adoptive owners. The school's last animal `` crisis'' occurred in the fall, when a bat colony turned up in the gym. The flying mammals made a terrible mess, drove basketball players, volleyball teams and even weightlifters into the street, and even disrupted a graduation ceremony. A bat expert contacted in late December put wire-mesh plugs into tiny cracks and crevices, enabling bats to leave but preventing them from returning. They gradually moved on to other locales.

<HEAD>Accused Mass Murderer Told Police He was `Drunk and Crazy'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BARTOW, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A man told police he was `` drunk and crazy'' and did n't remember firing weapons in the 1987 shopping center rampage that killed six people and wounded 10, according to a videotape played for jurors Wednesday. `` I know I must have got in some trouble tonight. I do n't know what happened, but whatever it was I'm sorry it happened,'' <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Cruse </PERSON> told interrogators 90 minutes after his capture in <LOCATION> Palm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>. `` I do n't remember firing at all,'' <PERSON> Cruse </PERSON> said. `` I do n't remember what happened That's the honest truth.'' Asked why he left home that day, <PERSON> Cruse </PERSON> told police `` I was drunk and I was crazy. I was n't in my right mind and that's for sure.'' <PERSON> Cruse </PERSON> is charged with six counts of first-degree murder, 24 counts of attempted first-degree murder and two counts of kidnapping. Prosecutors, who are seeking the death penalty, played about an hour of the 2 -LCB- - hour interview to counter defense claims that <PERSON> Cruse </PERSON>, 61, was temporarily insane the night of April 23, 1987 When told he fired on people at two shopping centers, <PERSON> Cruse </PERSON> said, `` I do n't believe it. You think I did that?'' <PERSON> Cruse </PERSON> said he did n't set out with the intention of doing any harm. Asked if he knew he had done something bad, <PERSON> Cruse </PERSON> replied, `` I must have. I'm here.'' When an officer told him: `` You shot some policemen there,'' <PERSON> Cruse </PERSON> said, `` Pardon me?'' Two police officers were among those killed. Prosecutors say <PERSON> Cruse </PERSON> armed himself with a semiautomatic rifle, a shotgun and a handgun and shot at just about everything that moved during a seven-hour siege. At one point while talking about weapons, <PERSON> Cruse </PERSON> blurted, `` I'm sorry I bought the damn things. Assistant State Attorney <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON> said the videotape was shown to show <PERSON> Cruse </PERSON>'s demeanor after his arrest. The state maintains that the former librarian was angry, not legally insane, when he opened fire at the two <LOCATION> Palm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> shopping centers. Duing the interview, <PERSON> Cruse </PERSON> described himself as `` kind of wasted.'' He said he used to be able to drink wine and beer and go to bed and sleep it off, but not anymore. `` I've got to stay away from the wine and beer because it drives me crazy,'' he said. The state planned to present two psychiatric experts of its own in rebuttal to defense mental health specialists who labeled <PERSON> Cruse </PERSON> a paranoid schizophrenic.

<HEAD>Pravda: Moldavian Demonstrators Infected with `Nationalist Virus'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Demonstrators impatient for change under new Soviet policies are wrongly turning to violence in <LOCATION> Moldavia </LOCATION>, Pravda said Wednesday. Thousands of demonstrators with signs reading `` Down with the Government'' gathered March 19 in <LOCATION> Kishinev </LOCATION>, the tiny western republic's capital, the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> daily said. A week earlier, more than 20,000 staged a similar protest and several police officers were seriously injured, it said. The grass-roots political groups that organized the protests seek changes in the republic's language and economic and environmental policies, as well as a crackdown on widespread crime and corruption, Pravda said. Pravda criticized the <ORGANIZATION> Moldavian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leadership for adjusting too slowly to the republic's changing political life and letting the protests get out of hand. But it also branded some of the local activists `` aspiring politicians, ambitious men, and simply unbalanced and socially immature people.'' President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> has allowed greater autonomy for the Soviet republics under his reform policy of perestroika. However, <PERSON> Pravda </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> Moldavian </LOCATION> activists were allowing their impatience for change to be infected with the `` virus of nationalistic narrow-mindedness.'' On Feb. 25, the republic's Party chief, <PERSON> Semyon </PERSON> <PERSON> Grossu </PERSON>, condemned nationalist activists for going too far but endorsed a demand to change the Moldavian alphabet to Latin script as it is in <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>. Moldavian and Romanian are the same spoken language, but dictator <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> imposed the Cyrillic, or Russian alphabet, on the Moldavians after Soviet troops occupied the region during World War II. <PERSON> Grossu </PERSON> said work is under way to gradually reinstitute the Latin script still used in neighboring <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Moldavia </LOCATION> has retained close ties with <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> despite repeated attempts by <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> to link it more closely with <LOCATION> Russia </LOCATION>. The region of 4.2 million people has passed from <LOCATION> Turkish </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Russian </LOCATION> to Romanian and back to Soviet control over the past century.

<TEXT>
 A fiery explosion tore through a $ 15 million automated rocket fuel mixing building at Hercules Aerospace on Wednesday, damaging the building but causing no injuries, officials said. The early morning blast jolted the western <LOCATION> Salt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> and lit up the night sky, but eight to 10 workers at the site remained protected in a distant bunker, company spokesman <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> DeMann </PERSON> said. By midday, investigators and officials from <ORGANIZATION> Hercules </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>'s headquarters in <LOCATION> Wilmington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Del. </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> and the state Division of Occupational Safety and Health were probing the wreckage of the mixing building and adjacent structures, said spokesman <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Olsen </PERSON> `` It could be weeks before the cause is determined,'' he added. He said static electricity, friction and potential problems with the mixture all would have to be considered as possible causes. The explosion occurred at 12:05 a.m. in a new section of the plant while 25,000 pounds of HTPB propellant was being prepared for a Delta II space rocket booster motor, <PERSON> DeMann </PERSON> said. The fuel is mixed in giant bowls by stainless steel blades that leave it with the consistency of heavy batter. The fuel then is poured into rocket cases and cured until it becomes solid. Hercules fire crews responded but, acting on company policy, did not try to fight the fire, <PERSON> DeMann </PERSON> said. It died out quickly. The building in which the fuel was mixed is made of concrete and reinforced steel with an interior wall separated by 10 feet of earth from an exterior wall. The explosion at the 7,000-acre Hercules complex, which is about 20 miles southwest of downtown <LOCATION> Salt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, was the first in 14 years, <PERSON> DeMann </PERSON> said. A similar blast on Dec. 29, 1987, killed five workers at <ORGANIZATION> Morton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Thiokol </ORGANIZATION>'s Wasatch Operations in northern <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>. The mixing buildings at the Hercules plant are used to make solid fuel propellant for the Delta II, the Titan IV, the Trident II, and the MX and small ICBM missiles. <PERSON> Olsen </PERSON> said the incident likely would have little impact on the <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> program since a new mixing building already was under construction at the site.

 Oscar producer <PERSON> Allan </PERSON> <PERSON> Carr </PERSON> promised the Academy Awards' opening number would be the most exciting 15 minutes in television history. It seemed like hours. For the record, the man who took `` La <ORGANIZATION> Cage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aux </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Folles </ORGANIZATION>'' to <LOCATION> Broadway </LOCATION> tried to fulfill his promise with a Snow White lookalike trilling `` Proud Mary'' to <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> brat packer <PERSON> Rob </PERSON> <PERSON> Lowe </PERSON>. That was after the dancers, encased in glittery, golden five-pointed stars, trooped onstage. As Oscar audience members stared blankly, a Snow White impersonator with a voice reminiscent of another cartoon heroine _ <PERSON> Betty </PERSON> <PERSON> Boop </PERSON> _ strolled through the Shrine Auditorium singing spoofs of popular songs rewritten with Oscar-oriented lyrics. A groan swept through the crowded Oscar press room minutes later when a somber <PERSON> Lowe </PERSON>, cast as <PERSON> Prince </PERSON> <PERSON> Charming </PERSON>, tried to sing and dance.

 `` Pelle the Conqueror,'' an austere tale about a father and son forging a new life in harsh <LOCATION> Danish </LOCATION> farm country, brought <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION> its second consecutive Oscar for foreign language film Wednesday night. The Scandinavian country won its first Academy Award last year with `` Babette's Feast.'' `` Oh it's so exciting,'' said a nervous Bille August, the director and writer. `` I made a film about a poor immigrant from <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION> and here I am standing in my tuxedo and this shiny thing,'' he said holding up his statuette. The story is told through the eyes of <PERSON> Pelle </PERSON> <PERSON> Hvenegaard </PERSON>, a Swedish boy who accompanies his widower father, played by <PERSON> Max </PERSON> <PERSON> Von </PERSON> <PERSON> Sydow </PERSON>, on a perilous adventure early in the century. <PERSON> Pelle </PERSON> finds his new home exciting and forbidding as he draws inner strength from his and his father's sufferings. `` I think it means a lot to Danish film,'' August said when asked about the significance of the award. `` It is very important to people in film in my country.'' Thirty-one countries submitted entries in this year's Academy Awards. Selection of each nation's entry is made by a jury composed of filmmakers from that country and only one film, which need not be released in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, is accepted. The Foreign Language Film Award Committee screened all entries before voting to nominate five films.

<HEAD>Church ``Elite'' Divided On Social-Political Issues</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE W. CORNELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Religion Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The `` elite'' of American Christianity, those in the upper echelons of power and influence, are found in a new study to be sharply divided in their social-political views. They also assume different priorities for their common faith. On economic and military issues, both mainline <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> leaders are on the left and fundamentalists on the right. On family-sexual issues, mainliners remain on the left, but Catholics join fundamentalists on the right. `` The ideological polarization is immense,'' says social scientist <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Lichter </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, who made the study with two colleagues. He added in a telephone interview: `` The differences seem to define the left and right poles of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> political discourse. What surprised me is that the mainline <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> leaders are so far to the left, and <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> leaders also are to the left on economic issues.'' The study involved replies to extensive questionnaires by 178 influential figures of mainline Protestantism, Catholicism and <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> fundamentalism, compiled through nominations by denominations and religious journals. <PERSON> Lichter </PERSON>, co-director of the <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Media </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION>, conducted the study with social scientists <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> <PERSON> Rothman </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Robert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Learner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Smith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>'s Center for the Study of Social and Political Change. Leaders of mainline Protestantism, an establishment that historically has set the tone for American society, were found `` liberal on every dimension,'' although members are fairly conservative, as shown in other studies. Eighty percent of them say they are political liberals, as do 59 percent of Catholics, compared to only 13 percent of fundamentalists, differences paralleling recent voting records. Catholic and mainline leaders are `` much more critical of capitalism,'' about a fourth of them saying the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> should `` move toward socialism,'' with big corporations `` taken out of private ownership and run in the public interest.'' In contrast, only 4 percent of fundamentalist leaders feel that way. Only slight majorities of mainline <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> leaders _ 52 and 64 percent respectively _ believe private enterprise is fair to workers, compared to an overwhelming 91 percent of fundamentalists. More than 80 percent of mainline Protestants and Catholics favor government action to reduce the income gap between rich and poor, compared to only 43 percent of fundamentalist leaders. The fundamentalists also are more hawkish than either mainline Protestants or Catholics, with majorities of fundamentalists saying the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> should be more forceful with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, compared to only minorities of Protestants and Catholics. Most fundamentalists also think it is sometimes necessary to undermine a foreign government and that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military should be the strongest no matter what the cost, with only about a fourth of Catholics and Protestants agreeing. But on most sexual-family issues, the alignments change. Only small minorities of Catholics and fundamentalists _ 22 and 17 percent respectively _ say women have a right to abortion, compared to 67 percent of Protestants. Also most Catholics and fundamentalists, 64 and 83 percent, say women with young children should not work unless necessary, compared to 28 percent of Protestants. Majorities of all three groups consider adultery wrong and also consider homosexual relations wrong, but only fundamentalists predominantly say homosexuals should not teach in public schools. Majorities of <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> leaders say preference should be given in hiring blacks and women, but only a minority of fundamentalists say so. Concerning Christian priorities, most Catholics and Protestants _ 54 and 57 percent _ and 95 percent of fundamentalists say bringing people to faith in <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> should be the main church focus in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. That also should be the main church focus abroad, say 90 percent of fundamentalists, compared to only 51 percent of Catholics and 46 percent of Protestants, about a fourth or more giving priority to improving the lot of the poor. The choices here, as in other areas, were related to political ideology, the report says. It notes that the vast majority of self-described conservatives select faith in <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> as the church's top domestic priority, compared to a minority _ 41 percent _ of liberals. `` Catholic leaders resemble their mainline Protestant counterparts except on issues of sexual morality, on which they agree more closely with the fundamentalists,'' the report sums up, adding: `` The views these leaders hold on the public face of the church are closely related to their own political values. Thus, religion and politics seem as intertwined in the lives of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s religious leaders as they are in the life of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> society.

<HEAD>Colleges Work To Counter Racial, Sexual Harrassment On Campus</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Amid two weeks of protests in February against racial incidents at <ORGANIZATION> Penn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, a young white man grabbed a black student by the arm and punched her in the eye. `` Why do n't you protest this,'' he said. During the past two years, 160 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> colleges have reported incidents aimed at black, Hispanic, Asian and homosexual students and faculty, said <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Uhrlich </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Against </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prejudice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Violence </ORGANIZATION>. `` Between 20 and 25 percent of all minority students on campus have been victimized at least once during an academic year,'' <PERSON> Uhrlich </PERSON> said, citing verbal harassment, cross-burnings, hate literature, beatings, brawls, anti-homosexual graffiti, swastikas and racially motivated slurs. `` The heart of the problem for many large campuses like ours is that a majority of our white students grew up in suburban areas or small comunities. They have had no positive experiences with minorities,'' said <PERSON> Grant </PERSON> <PERSON> Ingle </PERSON>, acting director of human relations at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION>, where a 1986 argument over the World Series erupted into a racial brawl. Pressured by student minority groups, colleges increasingly are naming provosts for minority affairs, recruiting and retaining more non-white teachers and creating programs to improve understanding. _ A minicourse titled `` Race and <ORGANIZATION> Rutgers </ORGANIZATION>'' began this semester to explore race relations at the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> university since the 1960s _ <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Chace </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Wesleyan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Middletown </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, sent students a letter in January that discussed racial relations on campus and the film `` Mississippi Burning'' about the 1964 murders of civil rights activists _ <ORGANIZATION> Stanford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> reported in February on an incident in which two students were barred from campus housing for two quarters for defacing a Beethoven poster with caricatures of a black person and leaving it near a black student's door _ Eighty-eight percent of the freshman entering the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wisconsin </ORGANIZATION> this fall will have to fulfill a new ethnic studies credit requirement Some minority students, calling attention to the issue with protests and sit-ins, have labeled these efforts window-dressing. They charge that colleges have not responded quickly enough and have not issued stiff enough penalties. Other critics question administrators' commitment to diversity. `` Some universities have created a -LRB- minority affairs -RRB- office or program and say they solved the problem. I see on many campuses where the minority affairs officer does n't have any power,'' said <PERSON> Reginald </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, senior scholar at the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION> `` Yet when you ask people on campus who is responsible, they point to that person,'' <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> said. `` Generally, the colleges that seem to be responding, unfortunately, are the ones where something has happened.'' Since the October 1986 World Series brawl at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION>, the school has instituted a tougher conduct code that more clearly defines what disciplinary action can be taken. It also has reinstated a freshman orientation program that encourages racial harmony. `` Our World Series event was the most visible major racial clash on a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> campus. I think we've been forced to do more in response than others,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Langley </PERSON>, an associate vice chancellor. Today's students `` did not live through the civil rights movement. Some do n't know the significance of <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Luther </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr </PERSON>. Some do n't even know who he was,'' <PERSON> Langley </PERSON> said. Despite effforts to recruit minorities and to keep the issue in the forefront, `` We have a situation that needs close watching. This campus is not settled. It's not calm,'' he said. `` This university has not had any true commitment to diversity,'' said <PERSON> Traci </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, 20, of <LOCATION> Springfield </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, a membe of a minority-rights group on the <LOCATION> Amherst </LOCATION> campus. She said the university needs to redouble its efforts. <ORGANIZATION> Penn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> a year ago hung posters at its 22 campuses proclaiming: `` Racism Has No Place at <ORGANIZATION> Penn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION>.'' The posters, which included telephone numbers to report incidents, were a way for the university to acknowledge that there some people thought racism was a problem on campus, said <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> Peterson </PERSON>, assistant vice president for campus life. Black students, who said five black women were accosted by whites as they walked downtown near the campus, demonstrated in February. Chanting `` Racism no. Racism must go,'' they demanded stiffer penalties for racist acts. `` Right now they -LRB- administrators -RRB- are doing surface changes,'' said <PERSON> Yvette </PERSON> <PERSON> Dudley </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> NAACP </ORGANIZATION> chapter at <ORGANIZATION> Penn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION>. `` They say they are open to changes, but we have n't seen any structural changes.'' Nearly a year after implementing the Madison Plan, a blueprint for increasing minority participation on the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wisconsin </ORGANIZATION> campus, the <ORGANIZATION> Interfraternity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> expelled a fraternity in November for incidents that included a slave auction where pledges donned blackface and afro wigs in skits that mimicked contemporary black entertainers. That action came a week after a university committee announced it could not punish the fraternity. `` The university still has n't developed an effective plan for disciplining students,'' said <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Holley </PERSON>, past president of the <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Student </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>. Not all the incidents involve race. The National Gay and <ORGANIZATION> Lesbian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Task </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, last year surveyed gay student groups on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> campuses. More than 70 percent of the 80 to 90 groups that responded reported some or much discrimination and harassment based on sexual orientation, said <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Berrill </PERSON>, a task force director. `` I think most colleges are n't doing anything,'' <PERSON> Berrill </PERSON> said. `` A couple of schools have taken steps, but most administrators are not dealing adequately with the problem. They have their heads in the sand.''

<HEAD>In Uncertain Climate, CDs Thriving</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHET CURRIER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Belying their long history as a simple, stodgy savings tool, certificates of deposit have lately become a hot _ and not so simple _ investment. At a time when the bloom is off the boom in mutual funds and many small investors are shunning the stock market, CDs have received an added boost from the sharp rise in interest rates over the past several months. Banks and savings institutions have been slow to raise the interest rates they pay on money market accounts. But in many areas of the country, they are competing feverishly to attract depositors with generous yields on CDs carrying maturities in the six-month to one-year range. Brokerage firms, meanwhile, are offering wide selections of CDs from banks across the country, in a bid to open or keep accounts for customers who are n't interested in the other merchandise on their shelves. At least two newsletters now compile and publish information on the highest yields available for savers interested in buying out-of-state CDs by mail. Just to keep the pot bubbling, there is the problem of insolvent savings and loans that the government is now struggling to solve. Even with federal deposit insurance covering deposits of up to $ 100,000, CD buyers are now putting increased emphasis on checking into the financial health of an institution before they entrust it with their money. Many investment advisers these days are recommending that savers buy CDs from a brokerage firm. A broker can offer convenience and a wide selection of CDs, quite possibly with yields higher than what local banks are willing to pay. The brokers typically collect their fees from the institutions issuing the CDs, so the buyer has no commission to pay. Furthermore, a broker may offer to buy back a CD from you before it matures, eliminating the customary penalty for early withdrawal. `` A broker would rather see you invest in stocks, bonds or something he or she would make a higher commission on,'' says <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Heady </PERSON> in his newsletter 100 Highest Yields, published in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Palm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION> `` But if your mind is made up on CDs, getting them for you is better than watching you walk out the door. `` The problem is that many brokers do n't look closely at the CD choices. They're made at corporate headquarters.'' Heady argues that you can not assume brokers have thoroughly checked the financial status of all the issuers of the CDs they have for sale. He also says many brokered CDs pay only `` simple'' rather than `` compound'' interest. What's the difference? Over time, compounding significantly increases your actual yield _ the amount of money your investment earns. The more rapid the compounding, the greater the benefit. To illustrate this point, notes the Boston-based <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Babson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Report </ORGANIZATION>, a one-year CD with a stated interest rate of 10 percent compounded daily would pay you more than a similar CD at 10.5 percent simple interest. If you are inclined to buy an out-of-town CD directly by mail, <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> Fosback </PERSON>, editor of the newsletter Income & amp; Safety in <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lauderdale </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, offers these suggestions: `` Telephone an institution and verify that the quoted rate is still in effect, and that the institution will pay interest from day of deposit without a ` hold.' `` Ask for a preassigned account number. Mark your check ` For Deposit Only,' and send a covering letter with full instructions, including your telephone number.'' End Adv PMs Thurs March 30

<HEAD>Republicans Face Long Odds in Fight for House Majority</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WALTER R. MEARS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Special Correspondent</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The good news, according to the million-dollar campaign manager, is that Republicans are at rock-bottom strength with the 174 House seats the party now holds. In the era of nearly invincible incumbents, that also is their bad news. While that means <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> strength probably wo n't go much lower, it also means the odds are prohibitive against any swift comeback from 34 years without a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> majority. <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Rollins </PERSON>, who was a White House political adviser to <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and managed his landslide re-election campaign in 1984, is the man assigned to find the way back. It involves the political equivalent of heavy lifting, but it pays well _ $ 250,000 a year, probably over the next four years. That price tag was not popular, stirring resentment among some of its presumed beneficiaries, since <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> members are earning $ 89,500 and did n't dare to vote themselves a raise this year. <PERSON> Rollins </PERSON> is the new co-chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, the party's <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> campaign organization. He says his goal is to make Republicans competitive for the 218 seats that make up a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> majority, which they have n't had since the 1954 elections. According to <PERSON> Rollins </PERSON>, that would put the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> in position to reclaim the majority in the mid-1990s. They start at what <PERSON> Rollins </PERSON> calls a low point, 174 out of 435 seats. That's down from 192 after <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s election in 1980. <PERSON> Rollins </PERSON> figures there are 160 safe GOP seats, in districts so securely Republican that they'd stay that way even if the national campaign organization shut down and did nothing to help. But seats that look safe come with no guarantees, as demonstrated Tuesday when the Republicans lost the <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> <LOCATION> House </LOCATION> seat once held by Vice President <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>. Democrat <PERSON> Jill </PERSON> <PERSON> Long </PERSON> took over a seat that had been Republican since 1976. That gives the Democrats 259 House seats, with two vacancies awaiting special elections. Republicans are trying return the favor next week in <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>, where a special election will fill the seat left vacant by the death of Rep. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Nichols </PERSON>, the longtime Democratic incumbent. That overall margin probably insulates the Republicans against significant <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> losses in 1990. The party holding the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> usually has suffered House setbacks in mid-term elections, because the president's party normally gained swing seats on his coattails in the previous election. But President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had no such coattails _ the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> lost three House seats in 1988. So there is no realignment pending in 1990, in either direction. But the sheer size of the Democratic margin and the better than 9 out of 10 liklihood that an incumbent will be re-elected confront <PERSON> Rollins </PERSON> and the Republicans with a mountain to be scaled on the way to anything approaching House control. <PERSON> Rollins </PERSON> already has started <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> groundwork for the reapportionment that will follow the 1990 census, which is expected to shift 18 <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> seats out of the <LOCATION> Northeast </LOCATION> and parts of the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION>, most of them to the southern and southwestern states that have become Republican territory. But there will be redistricting to reflect population shifts even in states that do not lose or gain seats. <PERSON> Rollins </PERSON> says Republicans will have the technical and legal know-how, and the political message to take advantage of the changes. There's no way to guess the outcome, but the last time a reapportioned House was elected along with a president, in 1972, Republicans won nearly two-thirds of the open seats. <PERSON> Rollins </PERSON> talks of emerging from the next two elections with net GOP gains of 30 seats, saying that would put a re-elected President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> within range of a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> majority for administration programs during a second term. He said it would be a philosophical majority, like the coalition of Republicans and conservative Democrats that gave <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> his early House victories. If <PERSON> Rollins </PERSON> can deliver that kind of progress, he'll not only earn his money, he probably should put in for a bonus. He advocates a strategy based on confrontation rather than compromise, telling reporters that <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> leaders always should think in campaign terms. `` We are in combat,'' he says. That hard line fits the style of Republican National Chairman <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> and Rep. <PERSON> Newt </PERSON> <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, newly-elected as the No. 2 man in the minority leadership. It does n't mesh with President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s ideas about bipartisanship in administration dealings with the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. But <PERSON> Rollins </PERSON> does n't argue; he says whatever works to keep the president popular works to the advantage of <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> candidates. <PERSON> Rollins </PERSON> says confrontation be part of a two-track strategy, with Republicans going after Democrats back home in their <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> districts even while the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration seeks bipartisan support for its proposals in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. But when <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> needs Democratic votes there is going to have to be some political bargaining. And if that leads to a call from the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> asking <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> political operators to lay off Democrats who may side with the administration? `` I hope Mr. <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> is the one who gets that call,'' said <PERSON> Rollins </PERSON>.

<HEAD>Algerian Party's Power Monopoly to be Contested in Election</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ALGIERS, Algeria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Sweeping political and economic reforms have been unleashed in <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION> by nationwide riots last year in which hundreds died. Following a constitutional referendum that opened up the one-party system, at least 19 political groups are planning to contest the monopoly of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> in legislative and municipal elections due this fall. The riots in October _ largely directed against the one-party system instituted at the end of <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> colonial rule in 1962 _ left 176 dead by official count; government opponents cited figures of 500 or more killed. But they brought changes that fundamentally transformed the structure of the state. The main architect of these changes was President <PERSON> Chadli </PERSON> <PERSON> Bendjedid </PERSON>, who was re-elected to a five-year term in December without opposition. Immediately following his election, <PERSON> Bendjedid </PERSON> opened a campaign for a new constitution, which eliminated `` socialism'' from the basic principles of the Algerian state and paved the way for the introduction of a multi-party system. The constitution was approved Feb. 24 by 73.4 percent of those voting. In the current period of transition, the 19 groups _ ranging from the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and Islamic fundamentalists to Western-oriented liberal and social democratic parties _ are adopting their statutes and future programs. <PERSON> Abderezak </PERSON> <PERSON> Bouhara </PERSON>, executive secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, said there was no reason why a `` renewed and revigorated party'' could not confront the democratic opposition of other groups for the defense of what he called <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION>'s `` socialist achievements. `` The front is perfectly capable of playing the democratic game,'' he added. But <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Belhadj </PERSON>, leader of the <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Salvation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> and regarded as one of the unconditional extremists of the Islamic movement, said, `` We are for the full and unrestricted application of Islamic sharia law. Our only constitution is the Koran, and the place of women is in the home.'' Other political opinions ranged widely. The Rally for Culture and Democracy demands that <PERSON> Amazigh </PERSON>, the language of the <LOCATION> Kabyle </LOCATION> people who have lived in <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION> since before the Arabs arrived, be recognized as a national language of <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION>. The leader of the Social Democrats, <PERSON> Abderrahmane </PERSON> <PERSON> Adjerid </PERSON>, said, `` We do not only want to distribute wealth but to create it, notably by encouraging private enterprise.'' Some time later this year, an extraordinary congress of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> will take account of the changes and adopt a policy for the future. Until then, President <PERSON> Bendjedid </PERSON> remains the party's president and one of his close allies, <PERSON> Abdelhamid </PERSON> <PERSON> Mehri </PERSON>, its secretary-general. An anomoly of the the present period of transition, the ruling party remains dedicated to socialism and one-party domination. In fact, rejecting views vigorously expressed by <PERSON> Mehri </PERSON>, the party congress took a position against the new constitution. This reflected the views of the party stalwarts who feared for their entrenched jobs and positions. But the party was greatly weakened shortly afterwards by the simultaneous resignation of all its army members. Many government officials are said to be looking to one of the 19 new parties for their future political allegiance. The new constitution requires that any political group that requests it be officially recognized and allowed to take part in the future elections. The only condition is that the party should uphold the constitution itself. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>'s official organ, Revolution Africaine, foresaw a plot to liquidate the party, beginning with the `` probability of an abandonment of the party by its president,'' Bendjedid himself. The chairman of one of the budding new parties said the president would form his own party and take into it all those loyal to him. Sources close to the president, speaking on condition of anonymity, said it was `` not unlikely'' that those loyal to Bendjedid would seek to establish a new party. They said the president himself intended to remain above the political turmoil. Some sources said the simplest solution to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>'s problems would be to change its name. But Revolution Africaine commented that there was `` genuine risk of the disintegration of the state and a danger for the construction of socialism in our country.'' This official party view runs close to an open statement of opposition to <LOCATION> Bendjedid </LOCATION>. It is not clear whether the president's adroit maneuvering will enable him to continue in control of the party long enough to take charge of a new, more liberal, political grouping likely to win majority support in the <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION> of the future.

<TEXT>
 In 1949, a time of intense West-West suspicion and hostility, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> and 10 European nations created the <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> alliance to thwart what they saw as a military threat from <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>'s expansionist <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. Now, 40 year later, the world has changed, the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> allies are soothed by <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s words and actions. They have become less committed to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and they foresee a stronger, independent <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. `` Some of the glue of the last 40 years is losing its potency,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Cross </PERSON>, deputy directaor of the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Strategic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studies </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. `` It will need to be replaced by a renewed sense of purpose and vision of the way ahead.'' And so, this is the state of <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> as it marks its 40th anniversary April 4. `` We have to adjust ... to new developments,'' <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> Secretary-General <PERSON> Manfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Woerner </PERSON> said in an interview. `` That of course is a phase which you could call a crossroad _ not changing our basic course but giving it a new vitality, perhaps even new speed and adjusting to new challenges.'' President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and other <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> leaders are expected to take a fresh look at the alliance's role at a summit May 29-30 at <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>'s headquarters in <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION> `` The alliance is at a point where it's less a problem of managing a crisis but rather a problem of managing change,'' said <PERSON> Ole </PERSON> <PERSON> Bierring </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION>'s ambassador to <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharp </PERSON>, senior researcher at the <ORGANIZATION> Stockholm </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>, said, `` Most of the problems associated with <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> are byproducts of its success.'' The key challenge facing the 16 nations of today's <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> still comes from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. President <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s agenda of glasnost and perestroika and his promises of reductions in troops and military spending have diminished the perception of that threat _ at least in the public's eyes `` It is very, very appealing,'' said Gen. <PERSON> Wolfgang </PERSON> <PERSON> Altenburg </PERSON> of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>'s military committee. `` Since'45, the publics in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> have lived under the impression that, ` Well, the war's over but it may start again.' But now all of a sudden those nations which were considered to be the big threat are apparently no longer a threat.'' The alliance also faces changes among its members. Americans, seeing a prosperous <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, question whether Europeans should carry more of the defense burden. Europeans, enjoying wealth and a stronger sense of identity, wonder why they should put up with foreign troops and extensive maneuvers on their soil. `` This whole question of burden-sharing is more or less the question of which role <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> plays in the future,'' said Secretary-General <PERSON> Woerner </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s future is being guided in part by `` 1992,'' the plan by the dozen nations of the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> to eliminate trade barriers and form a single market by then. All but one _ <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> _ belongs to <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>. Some defense officials worry the public euphoria over <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> will lessen support for defense spending and other commitments. The allies have just entered into new negotiations to try to lessen the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>'s strength in conventional weapons. <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> wants the Soviets and their <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact allies in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> to make much greater cuts to bring the two sides roughly to equal strength. The starting positions of the two sides, unveiled in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>, in early March, contain surprising similarities, leading to optimism about an eventual accord. But the talks have also added fuel to possibly the most controversial issue in <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> _ whether the alliance should modernize short-range, or battlefield, nuclear weapons. At the heart of the debate is a plan, pressed by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, to upgrade the Lance surface-to-surface missile. Military analysts say the <PERSON> Lance </PERSON>, introduced in 1972, will become obsolete in 1995. The missile has a range of a little more than 60 miles. Its replacement would have a range of more than 250 miles, just under the limits of the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces -LRB- INF -RRB- Treaty, which eliminates <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet land-based missiles with ranges of about 300 to 3,400 miles. Gen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Galvin </PERSON>, the American who is <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>'s top military commander in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, argues that modernizing the <PERSON> Lance </PERSON> will enable <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> to make sharp cuts in nuclear artillery. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> wants a firm commitment from the allies before it urges <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to approve money to produce the missile. But strong resistance in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, where most of the weapons would be based, has cast doubt. Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> said recently he wants to delay a decision on the production of the new missile until 1991 or 1992 _ after next year's important elections. He also wants an agreement that deployment plans would be scrapped if progress were made on cutting the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>'s conventional arms. <PERSON> Galvin </PERSON> said recently any discussions on reducing short-range nuclear forces should be delayed until `` after we were satisfied with the successes of the -LRB- conventional arms -RRB- agreement.'' <PERSON> Alton </PERSON> <PERSON> Keel </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassador to <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>, insisted <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> support for <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> remains strong. But he cautioned <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> political backing could be put at risk if the perception grew in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> that Europeans were not as committed. `` It's not now at risk ... but it could be,'' he said.

<HEAD>Churches Win Right To Sue Government For Spying Injuries</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE W. CORNELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Religion Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Religious leaders are applauding a court decision in which churches won the right to sue the government to protect themselves against spying on their activities. The outcome could lead to an injunction against such snooping if it is found to be common or might be repeated. Calling the decision `` beautiful,'' the Rev. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Andrews </PERSON>, chief executive of the <ORGANIZATION> Presbyterian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- <LOCATION> U.S.A. </LOCATION> -RRB-, commented: `` It makes a start on a much needed corrective. What it says is that we are a democratic country, and government agents ca n't go into your house, my house or God's house without a warrant.'' If they do, they can be held liable, a federal appeals court ruled in mid-March in a suit stemming from a 1985-86 sanctuary case. Bishop <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Chilstrom </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Evangelical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lutheran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, said the decision clears the way for churches in seeking `` to protect the integrity of their ministries from government interference.'' Seventeen religious groups, <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> and Jewish, had backed the suit challenging government infiltration of congregations as undermining their ministry and abridging religious freedom. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ninth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, asserting that churches have standing to sue on the basis of injuries claimed from government surveilance, declared: `` When congregants are chilled from participating in worship activities, when they refuse to attend church services because they fear the government is spying on them and taping their every utterance, all as alleged in the complaint, we think the church suffers organizational injury because its ability to carry out its ministries has been impaired.'' Those crippling disruptions were reported by four <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> congregations, three of them Presbyterian and the other Lutheran, as a result of undercover operations by the <ORGANIZATION> Immigration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Naturalization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. Its paid informants were key witnesses in the 1986 conviction and suspended sentencing of nine church workers including two <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> priests, a nun and a Presbyterian minister for helping provide sanctuary to Central American refugees. Over a 10-month period, the appeals court related `` several <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> agents wearing ` body bugs' infiltrated'' the four congregations, attending services, recording prayers, discussions, Bible readings. As a result of the surveilance, carried out without warrants, the court says the churches claimed these effects: Some `` members have withdrawn from active participation ... a Bible study group has been canceled ... support for the churches has declined, and congregants have become reluctant to seek personal counseling and are less open to prayers and confessions.'' <PERSON> Chilstrom </PERSON> said `` the trust which binds a community together was ruptured by unnecessarily invasive action by government.'' Afterward, the four congregations, joined by their parent bodies, the <ORGANIZATION> Presbyterian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> U.S.A. </ORGANIZATION>, and the <ORGANIZATION> Evengelical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lutheran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, filed suit for damages and a restraining order against the <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION>. Without seeking to justify the sanctuary movement, they charged the secret government surveillance crippled their religious functioning and also violated constitutional guarantees of free exercise of religion. They asked that the <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> be prohibited from such surveilance in the future without `` prior established and compelling government interest.'' A district court in <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> had thrown out the case without trial, saying constitutional protections of religious rights apply only to individuals, not church organizations, since `` churches do n't go to heaven.'' Reversing that decision, appeals court Judge <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Norris </PERSON> said churches do come under constitutional protections, observing: `` It is the churches whose services have been invaded by the government and whose congregants are the targets of the surveilance,'' with a `` concrete threat'' that their `` religious expressions are being recorded and put on file by the government.'' <PERSON> Andrews </PERSON> said in an interview from Presbyterian headquarters in <LOCATION> Louisville </LOCATION> that the decision means the government `` can not hide behind its status to avoid dealing with the issue of whether it was doing something wrong.'' He said the decision is important to all religious bodies, adding: `` It does n't say that churches can do anything they want just because it's in a church building, but that the same procedural protections of law apply there as well as anywhere else.'' The appeals court said it was unable to assess the likelihood of future <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> surveilance of churches, and returned that issue to the district court, along with the churches' request for an injunction against such activity. Assuming the government wo n't carry the case to the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Andrews </PERSON> said `` there'll now be a trial and a legitimate opportunity to find out whether this surveilance is standard procedure or what. `` The government will have to answer the question which it did n't have to answer before _ whether it still is doing these things. If we find out it's still occuring, we could get an injunction against it.''

 A Southern Baptist layman who helped mobilize the `` Christian right'' in politics warns against being linked to a `` cultural conservatism'' that does n't involve belief in God. E.E. <PERSON> McAteer </PERSON>, a Tennessean who left a longtime business career to become head of the conservative Religious Roundtable here, said in a recent mailing that the movement `` has its roots firmly planted in the Judeo-Christian ethic.'' He adds that `` to embrace people who do not believe in God is morally wrong and will result in the building of a political tower of Babel.'' <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Weyrich </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Survival </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> a </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Free </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, said in a subsequent mailing that cultural conservatism is not `` some sort of godless philosophy'' that considers God irrelevant, but he added: `` I welcome the help of all people who reach the same moral conclusion even if they have not reached it on the basis of the faith.'' <PERSON> McAteer </PERSON> said he fears `` an attempt to use evangelical Christians for purely political purposes.''

 Parodying the time-worn excuses people give for not attending church, a pastor wrote in his parish paper a satirical piece called, `` Ten Reasons Why I Never Wash,'' including: `` I was made to wash as a child. `` People who wash are hypocrites ... they reckon they are cleaner than other people. `` There are so many different kinds of soap, I could never decide which one was right.''

It also included these reasons: `` I used to wash, but it got boring so I stopped. `` I still wash on special occasions, like Christmas and Easter. `` None of my friends wash. `` I'm still young _ when I'm older and have got a bit dirtier I might start washing `` People who make soap are only after your money.''

 <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Corrigan </PERSON> heard the horror stories in high school: Attend a large university and you'll be just a number. Still, <PERSON> Corrigan </PERSON> had his heart set on the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Michigan </ORGANIZATION>, with a main campus enrollment of about 35,000. `` I was n't scared about the size of the university so much as I did n't want to not be able to see my teacher when I wanted to if I was having a problem or trouble with my work.'' Then he found out he could have it both ways. <PERSON> Corrigan </PERSON> signed up for The Pilot Program, a `` living-learning community'' that offers a personal approach to education through small classes taught by instructors who are resident advisers in the dormitory where the students live. The 26-year-old program, emulated at other schools, draws freshmen and sophomores from all majors and cultural backgrounds. Because of its size _ 400 students _ they also must take some courses with the rest of the population. `` People who studied education in the'60s thought a lot about the potential for combining academic life with the rest of life,'' said director <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Meisler </PERSON>, known in the academic community for his book, `` Trying Freedom: A Case for Liberating Education.'' Pilot co-founder <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, now director of <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> on Learning and Teaching, said the living-learning concept originated with monasteries, and at the college level with Oxford-Cambridge And while many small schools operated with that theory in mind, the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Michigan </ORGANIZATION> had no large, public university to turn to for a model. `` None of the specific details were simply lifted, they were really invented,'' he said, adding that the school's <ORGANIZATION> Residential </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>, founded in 1967, evolved simultaneously. That program, which also survives, is a four-year program which operates as a full college with its own faculty. Out-of-classroom contact between students and instructors can be a positive factor in student performance, said <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> <PERSON> Edgerton </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Higher </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION>. Students would benefit more if tenured professors could participate, <PERSON> Edgerton </PERSON> said, `` But the costs are just astronomical. That's why students pay a lot more to attend small, liberal arts colleges.'' Administrators say the cost of educating a Pilot student is comparable to that for other students, because the cost of individualized attention is made up for by the lower cost of graduate assistants and more efficient use of space. No extra fees are charged for participation in the program. <PERSON> Edgerton </PERSON> said a current trend in education is `` federated learning communities,'' in which a group of students takes three classes with a common theme, such as poverty or hunger. The three professors would work together on developing course material and would team teach. At <ORGANIZATION> Indiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Collins </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Living-Learning </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, courses usually are designed by a professor and only one faculty member lives with the students, said Director <PERSON> Ernest </PERSON> <PERSON> Bernhardt-Kabisch </PERSON>. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Fowler </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Sewall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Residential </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Program </ORGANIZATION> at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Colorado </ORGANIZATION>, said the 18-year-old program experimented with resident graduate instructors but decided more resident advisers were needed. The change was made not for academics, but because students needed more supervision. Like the <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Arbor </PERSON> program, retention rates are much higher than in the whole university, and there are fewer students on academic probation, he said. `` It's not easier. Get that out of your mind right now,'' said <PERSON> Falesa </PERSON> <PERSON> Ivory </PERSON>, 21, a senior psychology major from <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> who says her Pilot grades were comparable to her other marks. The Pilot Program has not compiled detailed statistics on student performance compared to the university at large. However, co-founder <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said the school's housing department kept track of each unit's performance in areas such as academics, intramural sports and vandalism during the 1960s. The unit the first Pilot students moved into had one of the lowest grade-point averages and one of the highest vandalism rates. After a few years, Pilot students were among the highest in academics and lowest in vandalism. A 1981-84 study conducted showed that while minority students at <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> had higher dropout rates than other students, those in the Pilot Program had an 80 percent to 95 percent retention rate. The university at large had a 70 percent retention rate, said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Schoem </PERSON>, a former director. In the Pilot Program, many of the courses may be used toward general education requirements. Students may find them more interesting because they deal with specific themes. <PERSON> Raouf </PERSON> <PERSON> Mama </PERSON>, resident director for academics, teaches an English composition course focusing on human relationships as they appear in literature. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Hartman </PERSON>, who is pursuing a master's degree in environmental education, teaches a course called Planet Management, focusing on issues like world hunger and politics. Their final exam might be to develop a dorm program or display on a specific crisis. One group of students discussing homelessness decided the best way to learn about it was to hit the streets. <PERSON> Hartman </PERSON>, also the hall's resident director for activities, said, `` For me, the thing about learning is if you can participate and be creative, have some power in your learning, then you have a better chance of learning.''

 The baby boy was found at the bottom of a motel trash bin. His face was swollen, his body still, strangled in the first hours of life and dumped by three people who sped off in a late-model <LOCATION> Chevy </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Nova </LOCATION>. `` It's such a waste of life,'' said <PERSON> Gardena </PERSON> police Detective <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Moreno </PERSON>, who is trying to trace the mother by a serial number on the video-game box into which the infant was stuffed. `` Who would do something like that?'' The mother who abandons her child is often unwed, perhaps has lost a job, is addicted to drugs or has mental or physical problems, experts say. `` Baby blues'' _ postpartum depression _ also can play a part. `` I was isolated. I felt very alone. I did n't feel there was anybody out there in the world that could possibly understand what I was going through,'' explained <PERSON> Gayle </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcuerquiaga </PERSON>, who left a newborn girl in a neighbor's trash. An estimated 20,860 children were abandoned in 1986 in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, ranging from babies dumped in the trash to toddlers left in foster homes and not reclaimed, according to the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Humane </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. `` This is just the tip of the iceberg because nobody keeps any hard figures,'' said AHA spokeswoman <PERSON> Katie </PERSON> <PERSON> Bond </PERSON>. It's hard to tell if abandonment is increasing, she said, because it represents only 1 percent of child abuse and neglect _ and those reports have climbed 212 percent since 1976. But <PERSON> Alex </PERSON> <PERSON> Morales </PERSON> of the Children's <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION>, a private, non-profit agency which places some forsaken babies in foster homes, said, `` There is an increase and a change in the flavor of what's behind it. It seems to be very related to substance abuse problems that the adults are having.'' `` It's an act of desperation,'' said <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Hicklin </PERSON>, assistant professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION>. Mrs. <PERSON> Marcuerquiaga </PERSON>, 28, who is appealing her attempted murder conviction and three-year prison term, calls her <PERSON> Sparks </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Nev. </LOCATION>, family typically American. She was a young mother juggling work, family, children, and financial ruin. She believes abandoning her baby last April culminated a series of events that included her father's death and a back injury that put her husband <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> out of work. Her job as a manicurist did n't bring in enough to support their sons, ages 8 -LCB- and 4 The couple separated for six months, and she got pregnant during a one-night stand. Yet she refused to believe she was pregnant until the child was born as she sat over the toilet, and even then the child was not real. `` If it were a child to me, that would not have happened,'' she said of the abandonment. The infant was put up for adoption because Mrs. <PERSON> Marcuerquiaga </PERSON> did not want her to grow up with knowledge of her first few hours. `` I felt if we brought her home, she would have to live with this, and she deserves better.'' In some cases, children have been left where there is a possibility someone will rescue them, such as doorsteps, churches, hospitals. A newborn boy was found in March 1988 outside a Mission Viejo urgent care center with a bag of diapers, a $ 20 bill and a note saying: `` Hi, my name is <PERSON> Brett </PERSON>. Please find me a good home.'' Last November, a woman pinned a note to the yellow sleeper of her infant son and left him on the steps of a Roman Catholic church here. The note, in Spanish, said: `` I have no job. I have no money. I am from <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>.'' In January, a newborn boy dressed in a T-shirt and diaper was left on the doorstep of a home in the upscale <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> suburb of <LOCATION> Simi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>. `` We were just thankful that we were home,'' said <PERSON> Valerie </PERSON> <PERSON> Carrillo </PERSON>. `` It was a shock to open up and see something so special on the doorstep.'' The Rev. <PERSON> Alberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Villalobos </PERSON>, who answered a bell at the door of <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> John </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> God </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Norwalk </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, in March 1988 to find a week-old boy, said the 22-year-old unwed mother was driven by fear. `` Nobody knew she was pregnant.'' The baby had been left with the note: `` Please take care of my child. Give him a good home. I ca n't, because I do n't have one.'' `` From what I know, she was a young person down on her luck who did what she thought was best for the child,'' sheriff's Sgt. <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Dickinson </PERSON> said of the decision not to file charges. The mother was not identified. An abandoned child becomes a ward of the county or, in some areas, the state. While authorities search for the parents, the child is put in a foster home, where it might live for up to 1 -LCB- years before it can legally be adopted. Psychologists and social workers say most abandoned children who are permanently adopted into good homes will not suffer any special problems. But <PERSON> Hicklin </PERSON> said `` some children think maybe they're to blame or something's wrong with them _ they must not be right or worthy of their mother's love.'' Finding parents willing to love a throwaway child is not difficult. Most waiting lines are years long for couples who want to adopt an infant. Each case of abandonment lights up switchboards nationwide with would-be parents. `` People are clamoring for babies,'' said <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> LaMotte </PERSON>, spokeswoman for the <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Children </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> `` They can walk in and hand the baby to us. No one needs to know their name.'' All the newborns abandoned in the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> area in the last year were unclaimed by parents. With older children, mothers sometimes do return. A woman who abandoned her 3-month-old daughter at a <LOCATION> Visalia </LOCATION> hospital in January, saying she could n't pay her medical bills, later returned for the baby and was offered help by county mental health workers. One of the more publicized cases is that of <PERSON> Christina </PERSON> <PERSON> LoCasto </PERSON>, who gave birth to a daughter, <PERSON> Alyssa </PERSON>, July 13 on a <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> jet bound from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. An airline worker later found the child stuffed into a bathroom waste bin, suffering from hypothermia and cuts on her back. Mrs. <PERSON> LoCasto </PERSON>, 24, of <LOCATION> Staten </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, pleaded innocent in July to one felony count of child endangerment. Custody of the child has been given to her paternal grandparents, and Mrs. <PERSON> LoCasto </PERSON> and her husband <PERSON> Louis </PERSON>, who apparently was unaware of the pregnancy, visit six hours weekly under supervision. Mrs. <PERSON> LoCasto </PERSON> is in therapy while awaiting an April 13 preliminary hearing, said her attorney, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>. If she changes her plea to guilty, she will face no more than a year in county jail. `` She does n't want to go to jail,'' said Assistant District Attorney <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Wagstaff </PERSON>. `` But we're not going to agree to that until we find the answer to the question: Why did she do this?'' <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON> <PERSON> Elliott </PERSON> survived an undetermined amount of time before being found Christmas Eve 1931 along an <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> desert highway by a couple changing a flat tire. Tucked inside a black pasteboard hatbox, the tiny red-haired waif drew nationwide attention and became known as the `` hatbox baby.'' Ms. <PERSON> Elliott </PERSON>, 57, theorizes she was born to an unwed woman fearful of a disapproving society, or perhaps the couple who found her had known the mother and made up the story of finding the child in the desert. She is happy to have been adopted, but there is a hard edge in her voice when she considers throwaway kids. `` There's so many places you can take a child. Do n't just dump them like a load of trash.''

 <PERSON> Fidela </PERSON> <PERSON> Pizarra </PERSON> thinks she might make enough money to start rebuilding the home she lost in a typhoon. <PERSON> Helen </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodica </PERSON> no longer has to beg in the streets to feed her family. Their new beginnings come from <PERSON> Marie </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> la </PERSON> <PERSON> Soudiere </PERSON>, a Frenchwoman who barks orders _ and encoura in the small, second-story office of Thread ofgement _ at them Hope for Economic Advancement, or THEA. They are among 40 women from impoverished squatter settlements who are making nightgowns being sold in boutiques in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and a half dozen other places in the world. De la Soudiere brought the women together last year. <ORGANIZATION> THEA </ORGANIZATION>'s goal is to provide a decent livelihood for destitute women who can not qualify for government jobs or who `` fall through the cracks'' of state welfare and assistance programs. It is among hundreds of cooperatives, most supported by foreign and local charity organizations, that provide jobs for thousands of Filipinos who otherwise face lives of abject poverty. De la Soudiere, who worked with international relief organizatioa major tax reform that is likely to strip away some of the benefits of buying and selling expensive artwork. Despite the egalitarian ideology of the Swedish welfare state, private wealth has blossomed over the last decade, bringing new money to old and modern art. Big companies also boost their prestige by displaying the best of Swedish collections in their corporate headquarters. All this has created a boom in the art market, and in art prices. `` Swedes have a lot of purchasing power right now,'' said <PERSON> Hans </PERSON> <PERSON> Dyhlen </PERSON>, director of the Swedish branch of <ORGANIZATION> Sotheby </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION>. `` Art is seen both as an interesting and a relatively secure investment. People buy art as a form of security planning.'' But buyers, he said, are n't very discriminating in their taste. <PERSON> Dyhlen </PERSON> said the competition on the art market increased five years ago, when a third big quality auction house, <PERSON> Beijers </PERSON>, was established in <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>. `` There's a lot happening on the Swedish art scene right now. A lot of young artists have exhibitions, and get their works sold.'' <PERSON> Bukowski </PERSON>'s auction house sold works last year worth 368 million kronor -LRB- $ 61.3 million -RRB-, about four times its sales in 1983. <PERSON> Goran </PERSON> <PERSON> Hellstrom </PERSON>, of <PERSON> Bukowski </PERSON>'s information department, said prices of high quality work have risen dramatically, and he had a kinder view of local tastes. `` People are more quality conscious now then five years ago,'' he said. Under current tax law, artwork is exempt from capital gains tax after five years of ownership, a break that is unavailable to sellers of stocks or real estate. `` I guess there have been just too many investments in art for the sake of evading taxes,'' <PERSON> Sven </PERSON> <PERSON> Karldstedt </PERSON>, a tax official, said. But whether or not the benefits of art ownership will be reduced in the tax reform is a political question. Last November, a little-known Swedish real estate tycoon, <PERSON> Hans </PERSON> <PERSON> Thulin </PERSON>, made a splash in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> modern art world. Within one week he bought <PERSON> Jasper </PERSON> <PERSON> Johns </PERSON>' `` White Flag'' and `` Rebus `` by <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Rauschenbert </PERSON> for a total of $ 13.3 million. A week later he paid nearly $ 2 million at a Swedish auction for <PERSON> Nils </PERSON> <PERSON> Dardel </PERSON>'s `` Dying Dandy.'' Although the business magazine <PERSON> Affarsvarlden </PERSON> listed Thulin among <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>'s 100 wealthiest families, <LOCATION> Stockholm </LOCATION>'s tabloids reported that he declared zero wealth in his 1986 tax declaration, and paid no income tax in 1986 or 1987. The average worker pays about half his salary in taxes to underwrite social welfare benefits such as free education and health care. But the high taxes also generate what Swedes call `` tax planning,'' the search for legal or illegal ways to evade taxes. For the small investor, some companies advertise shares in paintings which are stored away for selling after the five-year tax break takes effect, said <PERSON> Karl-Gustav </PERSON> <PERSON> Fernlund </PERSON>, a member of the governmental committee working on the tax revision. <PERSON> Fernlund </PERSON> said such companies were one reason why art investments have started to attract attention. <PERSON> Hellstrom </PERSON> said any tax on profits in art would primarily affect the quality auction houses and art dealers, which keep all transactions on file, and favor less serious dealers. He also said a tax could scare away buyers from the national market and encourage them to invest abroad, despite a 25 percent import tax on artwork brought into the country. The broadened interest in art, for whatever reason, has benefited Swedish artists. In a country of 8.4 million, 3,200 people are registered artists, and <LOCATION> Stockholm </LOCATION> has nearly 200 art dealers and galleries. Painters and sculptors in <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>, whether they sell their work or not, can apply for a grant of 40,000 kronor -LRB- $ 6,350 -RRB- from a governmental fund, but they can not qualify two years in a row. Of 2,300 applicants last year, 548 received the grant.

<TEXT>
 Nearly five decades ago, <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION> seized valuable 200-year-old amber artworks from a <LOCATION> Russian </LOCATION> palace as Soviet and German troops battled ferociously on the outskirts of <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION>. Four years later, the `` Amber Room'' treasures vanished inside <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> in one of the world's greatest unsolved mysteries. And now, thriller writer <PERSON> Heinz </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Konsalik </PERSON> has retold the tale in the best-selling novel `` Das <PERSON> Bernstein </PERSON> <PERSON> Zimmer </PERSON>'' -LRB- `` The Amber Room'' -RRB-, a work that combines fact with some highly imaginative fiction. Since 1945, stumped Soviet officials as well as private German treasure hunters have been looking for the collection of amber wall panels, figures and garlands taken from the famous <PERSON> Catherine </PERSON> <PERSON> Palace </PERSON>. The long search has turned up dozens of clues about the fate of the amber treasures _ from suspicions the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION> hid the collection inside a brewery cellar, to indications the artworks went down with a German ship sunk by a Soviet submarine in 1945. Last year, an anonymous man repeatedly called East German officials saying he knew where the collection was, but refused to disclose the location. So far, all the guesses, rumors and even well-researched hypotheses have led nowhere. In his book, <PERSON> Konsalik </PERSON> fuses the history of the Amber Room collection with speculation about what may have happened to the treasures. Parts of `` Das <PERSON> Bernstein </PERSON> <PERSON> Zimmer </PERSON>'' are wilder and more imaginative than most rumors about the collection's ultimate fate, and the writer himself warns not to seriously take those sections of the book. In the novel, a greedy American G.I. in occupied <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> steals the <ORGANIZATION> Amber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Room </ORGANIZATION> collection, goes on a murder spree to keep it from anyone else, transports it to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and four decades later blows the whole thing up while fantasizing that he's <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> the Great. Once again, in his new work, <PERSON> Konsalik </PERSON> has found all the ingredients necessary for winning a broad readership: espionage, intrigue, war, murder and romance. But the author says he thinks the main appeal of `` Das <PERSON> Berstein </PERSON> <PERSON> Zimmer </PERSON>'' is the still unsolved question: Where is the treasured collection? `` There is great interest in this subject because the Amber Room remains such a mystery.'' The novel recounts the greed of <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> leaders who ordered that the Amber Room treasures be seized as German troops attacked <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION> in 1941, the futile Soviet efforts to prevent the collection from being taken to <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and the artworks' disappearance in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Prussia </LOCATION> during the chaos that preceded <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON>'s defeat. For two centuries, the beauty and splendor of the Amber Room mesmerized those privileged enough to see its treasures inside the renowned <PERSON> Catherine </PERSON> <PERSON> Palace </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Pushkin </LOCATION>, just outside modern-day <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION>. The <PERSON> Catherine </PERSON> <PERSON> Palace </PERSON> was the summer residence of <LOCATION> Russia </LOCATION>'s royal family. Ironically, the Amber Room had German origins. In 1707, under instructions from Prussian King <PERSON> Friedrich </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilhelm </PERSON> <PERSON> I </PERSON>, German and Danish artists created decorative panels of brilliant amber for the <LOCATION> Charlottenburg </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Palace </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> the Great fell under the amber collection's spell during a visit to <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Friedrich </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilhelm </PERSON> decided to give it to the Russian czar to help secure the friendship of a valuable ally, according to historical accounts. The collection was loaded aboard sleds and transported in the winter of 1716-17 to <LOCATION> Petersburg </LOCATION>, which is now known as <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION>. The panels and other amber treasures were later installed in a room inside the Catherine Palace. In 1941, as German and Soviet troops fought savagely on the outskirts of <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION>, a special German team removed the collection from the <ORGANIZATION> Catherine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Palace </ORGANIZATION> and transported it safely to the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Prussian </LOCATION> city of <LOCATION> Koenigsberg </LOCATION> where it was placed in a museum. Four years later, the Soviets had turned the tables and were defeating German troops within the Third Reich. Nazi leaders had the Amber Room collection packed up and ready for transport to keep the artworks out of Soviet hands. But from that point on, there are only traces of what happened to the treasures. <PERSON> Konsalik </PERSON> thinks the <ORGANIZATION> Amber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Room </ORGANIZATION> collection has been lost for good. `` There are many trails leading to various places, but I do n't believe it will ever be recovered.'' More than 91,000 hardcover copies of <PERSON> Konsalik </PERSON>'s `` Das <PERSON> Bernstein </PERSON> <PERSON> Zimmer </PERSON>'' have been sold since the book appeared in print earlier this year, according to his publisher, <ORGANIZATION> Hestia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Verlag </ORGANIZATION>. His work is often ignored by <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s highly demanding book critics, who concede his popularity but question the literary quality of novels. But he has written 122 works, and his books have been translated into 26 languages. He has sold an estimated 72 million copies of his books worldwide. With that kind of popularity, <PERSON> Konsalik </PERSON> has no trouble shaking off suggestions that he is not a `` serious'' writer. `` These people are far more important to me than a dozen or so critics,'' he said about those who buy his books.

 Spring came gently this year to <ORGANIZATION> Gallaudet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, with no outward sign of the tumult that catapulted the nation's only university for the deaf to international prominence and led to the naming of its first deaf president. But a year later, the spirit of the `` Deaf President Now'' protest lives on _ in newfound pride and assertiveness among the deaf, in heightened awareness and understanding among the hearing. `` The euphoria is still here. The energy is still here,'' said I. <PERSON> King </PERSON> <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Gallaudet </ORGANIZATION>'s president. `` The sense of purpose, the sense of community _ it's better than it was ever before. It gets better all the time. Something fundamental has changed in the beliefs that deaf people have about themselves and that hearing people have about deaf people.'' <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON> won his post March 13, 1988, after students, joined by faculty, staff and alumni, shut down the 125-year-old school for five days and forced the board of trustees' initial choice to resign. She was <PERSON> Elisabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Zinser </PERSON>, a hearing woman who did not know sign language; she was gone within a week. Lofty pronouncements emanated by the dozens from protesters riding the exhilarating crest of victory last spring. `` God made the world in seven days and we have changed it in seven days,'' deaf chemistry professor <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Giansanti </PERSON> said then. Nothing will ever be the same, said countless others. Visionaries or fools? The developments of the past year point to the former. Enrollment at the 2,400-student university is up 52 percent. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, which provides most of the Gallaudet budget, boosted its contribution 6.2 percent. The two congressmen on the <ORGANIZATION> Gallaudet </ORGANIZATION> board are learning to sign. The new deaf chairman of the board developed a plan to recruit deaf board members. <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON>, in constant demand to speak, has become an inspirational symbol revered by deaf people all over the country. Perhaps the most fundamental change is a shift in attitude. `` People have developed a lot more confidence in themselves,'' said <PERSON> Greg </PERSON> <PERSON> Hlibok </PERSON>, student body president and part of the intense quartet that led the insurgency. `` Their pride has increased. Their view of the future _ they look forward to much more than people did five years ago. There's a wider range of perspective.'' Off campus, the story is similar. `` More people are aware of deafness,'' <PERSON> Hlibok </PERSON> said through an interpreter. `` Before, they looked at us as a problem. Today, they look at us as people with a problem _ deafness. That's all.'' The board chairman, <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> executive <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Bravin </PERSON>, said <ORGANIZATION> Gallaudet </ORGANIZATION>'s week in the limelight was enough to propel much of the private sector from discomfort to openness toward the deaf. Referring to his and <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON>'s speaking engagements around the country, <PERSON> Bravin </PERSON>, who also won his job as a result of the insurgency, said that `` countless times we have run into people saying that their job or working conditions changed for the better overnight as a result of <ORGANIZATION> DPN </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- the Deaf President Now movement -RRB-. That's a very positive thing to hear. It's not limited -LRB- to a few corporations -RRB- but -LRB- is -RRB- very global.'' Again and again, one is told of students landing jobs they were never able to get before _ whether because of their own insecurity or an employer's intolerance. One girl, told that a pizza delivery job had been filled, passed by the store next day and saw the `` help wanted'' sign again in the window. She confronted the supervisor and got the job. `` She felt that empowerment that a year ago she might not have felt,'' said <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>. Since the protest, students have `` a general attitude of ` I can win, I can succeed, I can achieve what I want,''' said career center director <PERSON> Sue </PERSON> <PERSON> Pressman </PERSON>. At the same time, she said, employers have become more receptive to hiring deaf graduates and many more companies are participating in <LOCATION> Gallaudet </LOCATION> career fairs. `` You do still find a lot of attitudinal barriers,'' she said. `` But the deaf protest allowed us to go in and work with those people. Employers are looking to Gallaudet for the answers. They're willing -LRB- to hire deaf people -RRB- They want us to help them. They're looking to us to show them the way. The same heightened interest is evident in <LOCATION> Gallaudet </LOCATION>'s internship program, which has expanded rapidly since the protest `` The one big thing is -LRB- that -RRB- we have name recognition now. We never had that before with private companies, and it's an important entree,'' said program director <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> <PERSON> Nissen </PERSON>. <PERSON> Nissen </PERSON> said she used to have to give a long explanation of <LOCATION> Gallaudet </LOCATION>, often with little to show for it. `` People were always courteous, because you're not rude to people who are explaining a disability, but they did n't follow up,'' she said. `` Now there's a lot of curiosity and eagerness to be attached to a famous place. We have milked that.'' New participants in the internship program include <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Roebuck </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Saks </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fifth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Avenue </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Northern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telecom </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> MCI </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> T </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratories </ORGANIZATION>, and several Big Eight accounting firms. Students are doing more challenging work, <PERSON> Nissen </PERSON> said, and are more likely to complain promptly if a job turns out to be busywork. Students say they're being treated better not only on the job but in other aspects of daily life as well. `` When I used to go to a restaurant and ask for paper and pen to order some food, people tended to have a negative attitude,'' said <PERSON> Hlibok </PERSON>. `` Now there's a willingness. They're eager to help.'' The other big change, the four protest leaders said through an interpreter, is that the nation's deaf community no longer sits on its hands when its interests are at stake. `` This was our first movement,'' said <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Covell </PERSON>. `` Deaf people now feel that we're entitled to our opinion. <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> Rarus </PERSON> recalled his doubts in organizing a <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> rally to demand telecommunications devices for the deaf on phones at federal agencies. `` I thought, deaf people are n't going to show up,'' he said. `` But they did. We got a good crowd.'' <PERSON> Hlibok </PERSON> said another successful rally was held in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> to protest threatened budget cuts for state schools for the deaf. `` There's an unwritten rule since the protest'' at <LOCATION> Gallaudet </LOCATION>. `` When something happens that's a crisis in the deaf community, deaf people are going to act,'' he said. `` That did n't happen before the protest. We asked ourselves, ` Should we or should n't we?' But, now, if something's wrong, we're going to speak out right away. <PERSON> Hlibok </PERSON>, Rarus, <PERSON> Covell </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bridgetta </PERSON> <PERSON> Bourne </PERSON> all said they plan to attend law school in the next few years and serve the deaf or disabled community in some fashion. They are acutely conscious of their legacy _ not only to the school, but to the larger deaf community as well. `` We made history,'' <PERSON> Covell </PERSON> said simply. `` Now small deaf children will look to that and will learn something from it. We were oppressed and finally we said, ` Enough.' They will do better than we did. They'll continue what we have n't finished.''

<TEXT>
 Ordinary people, extraordinary paintings. Call <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> <PERSON> Benton </PERSON> a failed artist as one critic does. Quibble over whether regionalism was a legitimate movement in <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> art history. Accuse him of betraying himself by turning away from fashionable modernism to paint realistically. But because his paintings about everyday people appeal to everyday people does not mean they are unsophisticated, says <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>, curator of American Art at the Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art. The paintings _ his murals especially _ are bold, colorful and dramatic. They have, as <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> says, the tendency to pop off the wall. April 15 marks the 100th anniversary of <PERSON> Benton </PERSON>'s birth. Were he still alive, the artist could celebrate with his fans at <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON>'s, a popular saloon and the kind of place where <PERSON> Benton </PERSON> would be pleased to have his pictures hang. An afternoon bourbon party is held each Sunday in his honor. Or he could attend the opening of the first major exhibition of his work since his death. The Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art will display 90 of his paintings beginning April 16. <PERSON> Benton </PERSON> spent much of his life among the intellectual and creative in the world's most exciting cities. His home was once a gathering place for such luminaries as the poet <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Sandburg </PERSON>, and folk singers <PERSON> Burl </PERSON> <PERSON> Ives </PERSON> and <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Seeger </PERSON>, a place where bourbon oiled conversation and <PERSON> Rita </PERSON> <PERSON> Benton </PERSON> set a memorable table. He was happiest, though, trudging across the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Southwest </LOCATION>, sketching farmhands, saloon girls and factory workers. `` I like people and primarily I paint for them,'' the artist said at the height of his acclaim in 1936. `` If they can see something in these paintings out of their own lives, I do n't care what they think or know about art.'' The exhibition, the first traveling show staged by the <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON>, will close June 18 in <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> and open Aug. 4 at the <ORGANIZATION> Detroit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arts </ORGANIZATION>, Nov. 17 at the <ORGANIZATION> Whitney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Museum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Art </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and April 29, 1990, at the <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Museum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Art </ORGANIZATION>. By necessity, the show's organizers ignored the irony of putting <PERSON> Benton </PERSON>'s work in a museum. Museums, the artist once said, are graveyards generally run `` by a pretty boy with delicate wrists and a swing in his gait.'' That 1941 diatribe to reporters in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> _ which got worse _ also included some thinly veiled criticisms of figures at the Nelson. It made all the papers, and <PERSON> Benton </PERSON> was fired from his teaching job at the <ORGANIZATION> Kansas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Art </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>. And by 1948, he was excluded from a list of the 10 best American painters drawn up by Life magazine. `` You are constantly trying to figure out whether he was a fool or a genius. The answer is, of course, he was both,'' says <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>, whose <PERSON> Benton </PERSON> biography will be published as the exhibition opens. <PERSON> Benton </PERSON> loved bourbon and books, <PERSON> Rita </PERSON>, his harmonica and family musicales, bourbon, ordinary Ozarks folk, telling stories, stirring up things, locomotives and bourbon; but most of all he loved to paint. Paint he did until the day he died, every day in the studio out back, usually 10 hours a day. <PERSON> Rita </PERSON> found him dead of a heart attack in front of his last mural. It was for the Country Music Hall of Fame in <LOCATION> Nashville </LOCATION> which had upset him because he had not quite got the <LOCATION> Wabash </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cannonball </LOCATION> right. He was 85, and had just finished the work that afternoon _ Jan. 18, 1975. His wife died three months later. She could n't live without him, their daughter, <PERSON> Jessie </PERSON>, said. `` He got up every morning excited about life and eager to go to work,'' <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> said. `` This was someone always very alive, always very excited about the next project. There was an intensity in the way this man lived. They had a way of making things that seem ordinary to us, the moon or a dead tree stump, seem like something special.'' Time Magazine put him on the cover Dec. 24, 1934, calling him one of the leaders in a new movement in <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> art called Regionalism. <PERSON> Benton </PERSON> accepted the label _ in some ways it was a gimmick, <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> says _ and declared himself free of modernist and abstract directions artists in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> were taking. That, his detrators say, was bad. <PERSON> Benton </PERSON> showed promise in the 1920s when he experimented with abstraction, but betrayed himself by abandoning it, said critics <PERSON> Clement </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenberg </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hilton </PERSON> <PERSON> Kramer </PERSON>. `` The person whom we are celebrating here today, in my view, was a failed artist,'' said <PERSON> Kramer </PERSON>, editor of The New Criterion in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Kramer </PERSON> said that art should be judged for its aesthetic qualities, not its cultural themes. <PERSON> Benton </PERSON> fails when judged aesthetically, he said. `` Now in the 1980s, we are celebrating the second coming of <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> <PERSON> Benton </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Kramer </PERSON> said. `` He is being seen as a very model of success. But, in my view, this wo n't succeed. I find it mostly myth that he was a great <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> artist who somehow gave <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> art its quintessential essense.'' The tumult of the times in which he lived influenced <PERSON> Benton </PERSON>'s painting A time of great political, social and economic change yielded themes of growing industry, of injustice and of the agrarian, rural life that was being left behind. Criticism of <PERSON> Benton </PERSON>'s painting, then, often had to do with his subjects. He was at times labeled a fascist and a communist, a racist and anti-Semitic. However, he was most likely a New Deal, liberal Democrat, according to <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>. `` His role as a painter was to make the invisible visible. There is always a message to what <PERSON> Benton </PERSON> is doing, usually an ambiguous one. He did n't want people to look at a painting and come away feeling smug because they knew what he meant,'' <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> says. <PERSON> Benton </PERSON>'s greatest works were murals painted for the states of <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> mural was commissioned for the World's Fair in 1933 and now hangs at <ORGANIZATION> Indiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. The <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> mural, finished in 1936, is in the House Lounge in the Capitol at <LOCATION> Jefferson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. Shortly before he died, <PERSON> Benton </PERSON> said, `` If I have any right to make judgments, I would say that the Missouri mural was my best work.'' `` A Social History of Missouri'' took 18 months to plan and six months to paint. <PERSON> Benton </PERSON>, who stood only 5-foot-2, was quick with his fists as a boy in rough-and-tumble <LOCATION> Neosho </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo. </LOCATION>, and quick with his wits later in life. Self-taught mostly in things other than art, he had `` a Renaissance range of interests,'' <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> said. `` I have run into my father's critics all my life,'' said <PERSON> Jessie </PERSON> <PERSON> Benton </PERSON>. `` But also I've run into people who adore the paintings in a mystical way, even more then I do. `` I think people should remember him as a man who put life into art. And art into life.''

 The `` bad old days'' before abortion was legalized were not so bad, say anti-abortion advocates who contend women's lives would not be imperiled if abortion should be outlawed once again. They argue that better antibiotics, intensive care units and surgical techniques were already halting the serious bleeding, infections and other complications of illegal abortions before the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> overturned state bans on abortions in 1973. `` Legalization of abortion in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> apparently did not save a single woman's life,'' asserted Dr. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Willke </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Right </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> to </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Life </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. He contends that before 1973 there were not many illegal abortions and says that very few women died from abortions. Federal health officials agree that statistics show the death rate from complications of illegal abortions was declining before 1973. But supporters of women's right to abortion dispute that a renewed ban on abortions would not have serious health consequences. They note there are no statistics on the number of women who suffered non-fatal health problems from illegal abortions. The debate over abortion is intensifying as the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> prepares to hear arguments April 26 over <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> regulations that restrict the availability of abortions. Both sides expect the court to use the case to reexamine the landmark <PERSON> Roe </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Wade </PERSON> decision that legalized abortions in 1973. Opponents of Roe-Wade, including the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration, are asking the court to declare there is no constitutional right to abortion and return to the states the power to restrict or outlaw abortions. In a telephone interview, <PERSON> Willke </PERSON> said `` nobody has the slightest idea'' how many illegal abortions took place before 1973. However, he said, the number of abortion-related deaths was more concrete because `` a perforated uterus _ which is evident on autopsy _ a massive infection, a hemorrhage ... -LRB- make it -RRB- pretty obvious what has happened.'' <PERSON> Willke </PERSON> said that in the 1950s, an average of 250 women a year were reported to have died in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> due to illegal abortions. But by 1966, while abortion was still illegal everywhere, the annual number of reported deaths had dropped to 128. In 1972, the year before Roe-Wade, 5 million pregnancies and 39 abortion-related deaths were reported. After 1973, when the ban ended in all states, `` illegal abortion presumably disappeared,'' <PERSON> Willke </PERSON> said. `` If, in fact, the elimination of illegal abortion eliminated back alleys, there should have been a perceptible drop in the number of women dying. That did n't happen. The line did n't even blip from 1967 to 1973 and 1974. ... It just kept going down at the same slow rate. There was no evidence of a decline in mortality from legalization.'' Dr. <PERSON> Hami </PERSON> <PERSON> Atrash </PERSON>, acting chief of pregnancy epidemiology at the federal <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION>, said, `` The trend has been going down since 1940, just like for any other cause of death.'' The <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> did not begin keeping thorough records on abortion-related deaths until 1972. It has two sets of slightly inconsistent figures covering some years before 1972 that essentially back up the anti-abortion group's figures. <PERSON> Sandy </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Statistics </ORGANIZATION>, said it was possible some doctors falsified death certificates to protect victims of illegal abortions. `` There's no way to know,'' said <PERSON> Atrash </PERSON>. `` Even today, some people say women die of abortions and they're not reported.'' The <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> also does not have figures on how many women suffered severe bleeding, infections, hysterectomies and other complications from abortions but survived. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Andrews </PERSON>, acting president of the <ORGANIZATION> Planned </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parenthood </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>, said statistics from the time `` are not terribly reliable because it was an illegal procedure and nobody kept count.'' `` But people who lived through that period know that women were dying, women were maimed, many women lost their fertility'' due to botched abortions, <PERSON> Andrews </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Willke </PERSON> predicted that if abortion should become illegal again, about 100,000 women a year would have the procedure anyway. An estimated 1.5 million abortions have been performed annually since 1973. `` I do know that this time around, illegal abortions will be considerably safer than they were,'' <PERSON> Willke </PERSON> said. `` People who do them have had a great deal of experience.'' <PERSON> Andrews </PERSON> disagreed. `` Doctors who are capable of providing the service ... would not risk their professional careers,'' he said. `` What you would get would be inadequately trained, back-alley practitioners _ probably people who are not doctors _ who simply have as their goal the exploitation of women.'' <PERSON> Willke </PERSON> says the best ways to address the problem of unwanted pregnancies would be to grant tax incentives for adoption and place non-white children with white adoptive parents. He contends a significant percentage of all abortions are `` birth control abortions.'' `` People know they have this backstop so they take chances,'' he said. `` ... When you ca n't get abortions, you're more careful _ or you do n't do it -LRB- have sex -RRB-.''

 Women seeking alternatives to `` back alley'' abortions found a scattering of oases even before the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> legalized abortions 16 years ago. Most of the attention focused on <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, which quickly became a mecca for women who wanted to end their pregnancies after the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> erased a ban on abortions in 1970. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> was n't the first state to ease abortion restrictions, but it was the only one that did not limit abortions to state residents and it was one of only three that did not require the consent of a parent or spouse. Women seeking abortions began flooding into the state. The first legal abortion in the state was performed July 1, 1970, and by the time the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> made abortions legal nationwide on Jan. 22, 1973, nearly 400,000 women had traveled to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> to terminate pregnancies. They found clean facilities, counseling and a matter-of-fact candor that contrasted sharply with the shadowy world of illegal abortions. Abortion clinic staff members, some sporting pink carnations in their lapels for easy recognition, met flights at airports and escorted patients into vans or limousines. The <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Guttmacher </PERSON> <PERSON> Institute </PERSON> says legal abortions were performed for 48,000 women from other states in 1970, 155,000 in 1971, 172,000 in 1972 and 84,000 in 1973. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> residents had 41,000 abortions in 1970, 101,000 in 1971, 110,000 in 1972 and 120,000 in 1973. The rush tapered off after the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Roe </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Wade </PERSON> decision. But supporters of the right to an abortion fear the current court may reconsider that ruling when it hears arguments in a case involving <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> abortion rules April 26. About 80 clinics and hospitals were licensed to perform abortions in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. Each year, they aborted as many pregnancies as there were live births in the city, said <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> <PERSON> Pakter </PERSON>, who was director of the <ORGANIZATION> health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> department </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Maternity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> and Family Planning. <PERSON> Polly </PERSON> <PERSON> Rothstein </PERSON>, director and co-founder of the <ORGANIZATION> Westchester </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Legalized </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Abortion </ORGANIZATION>, recalled limousines from posh, private clinics `` meeting patients at airports and bringing them to abortion clinics in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, for no questions asked, safe abortions.'' A visit to one such clinic as an observer in 1972 `` was an eye-opener for me,'' she said. `` It was a blessing _ just a blessing for people to have it done by a doctor in a sterile clinic. Breaking the law, the sneaking around, the anxiety attached to it _ ` Will I get it? Will I get it?' _ was removed,'' she said. `` We were seeing women coming from all over the country,'' said <PERSON> Libby </PERSON> <PERSON> Antarsh </PERSON>, then director of the Eastern Women's Center. `` Many of the women who came _ really, there were a lot of young girls _ had never been to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Some had never flown or been out of their small towns. They were terrified. `` The waiting room was enormous, but on Saturdays not an inch of floor space was visible,'' she said. `` The patients and visitors, mostly jeaned, smoking, young, scared, blond, from -LRB- states like -RRB- <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, were everywhere.'' The center provided abortions seven days a week, with a sliding fee scale that topped at $ 150, and ran a free van service to and from <LOCATION> LaGuardia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>. `` There was a counselor on board as well as a driver. We would meet the flights, try to calm them down, talk to them about what they might expect for the day,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Antarsh </PERSON>. `` You can imagine the tension and feelings of those young women.'' The patients went home the same day, she said. `` It was easier for young women to have an unexplained absence for -LRB- just -RRB- a day. On a Saturday, they could fly in the morning, come home at night and no one would know about it.'' <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> designated Planned Parenthood's family planning hotline as an official abortion information number. It was posted on bulletin boards of college campuses and social work agencies around the country. `` We sat down at these phones and they never stopped ringing,'' said <PERSON> Marcia </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON>, director of communications for Planned Parenthood of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. `` There was never a point during the day when all five buttons were not lit. They were calling from everywhere, every state in the union. `` We always tried to give the woman the strength to truly see clearly what it was she honestly wanted to do. That was our job as we saw it, not to push her in either direction,'' she said. `` But when someone has hitchhiked from <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, you can not really say, ` Are you sure you really want this abortion?' She has clearly indicated that she wants it.'' Teen-agers were told to ask a trusted adult to call Planned Parenthood, help them arrange transportation and ensure adequate medical follow-up. The flood lasted into the first few months of 1973, until other states responded fully to the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>'s ruling. It was, said Ms. <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> of Planned Parenthood, `` as though heaven had opened up and said, ` You have a second chance to make everything right and get it back to where it was before.' ... It made an enormous difference not to be made to feel like a criminal when they were trying to make a moral choice in the best, fullest sense.''

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A mile and a half from the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, on a glorious spring morning, a young man astride an expensive bicycle has staked out a corner in an open air drug market, awaiting the day's trade. The mayor, making his rounds, encounters questions about drugs and murders wherever he goes; a meeting with the black press turns rough. In a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> courtroom, defendants in phosphorescent orange jumpsuits, the shoestrings removed from their shoes, shuffle before a judge. But also in the newly-dubbed `` murder capital'' _ 358,300 yellow daffodils bob in the breeze, nannies push strollers along the streets, residents marvel about the rising value of their homes _ and worry about the gypsy moth. During two days last week, AP reporters were dispatched to different quarters _ far different, though not far apart _ to observe life in the city in the spring of its travail. Here are their reports:

<HEAD>At the Drug Market on a Sunny Morning</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 It is 9:20 a.m., the end of the morning rush hour on a glorious spring day, and the drug markets in one of the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>'s toughest neighborhoods are open for business. A few blocks away, cars stream down <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Avenue </LOCATION>, carrying lawyers, lobbyists, consultants to work. Here, a young man astride an expensive 10-speed bicycle has staked out a corner. The light changes to green, but he stays put. It changes again; he remains in place. A nonverbal offer from a driver to let him cross the street is waved off. This is the <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Heights </ORGANIZATION> section of town, which a study has identified as the most murderous in the most murderous city in the nation. A survey of 714 killings during a 42-month period found that this section _ bounded by 14th, 16th and <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> streets and <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Avenue </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Northwest </LOCATION> _ had more slayings, 21, than any other census tract in the city. At the nearby <LOCATION> Spanish </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION>, employees are afraid to walk alone to their cars at night. The White House is 1 -LCB- miles away. Not much going on here: Just guys hanging out, no school, no jobs. But there is unusual attention to a car driving slowly by, an expectant look, a look indicating that business might be done. There's a fair amount of shaking of hands, a normal, friendly gesture that could also be a drug deal consumated.

<TEXT>
 The doctors and technicians at the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>'s `` <ORGANIZATION> MedStar </ORGANIZATION>'' cluster get one minute's alert that a gunshot victim is on the way Other emergency rooms, including a separate one in the same hospital, handle more routine cases. <ORGANIZATION> Medstar </ORGANIZATION> is for when it's bad. At 7:15 p.m., a young man picked up in one of the city's drug corridors is wheeled in from an ambulance. He's got a bunch of bullet holes and no blood pressure. The bottoms of his feet are turning yellow. At a speed that must be possible only because the team has done this so many times, the man's clothes are cut off and he is hooked up to life supports and fluids are pumped in. The doctor carves a long gash across the left side of his chest and uses a metal device to pry it open for heart massage. With youth on his side, blood pressure returns and his heart, in plain sight, is beating strongly. Seasoned observers give him a 5 to 10 percent chance. Within 25 minutes, he's out of <ORGANIZATION> Medstar </ORGANIZATION> and in the operating room. The Easter weekend had been quiet, and as they cleaned up the <ORGANIZATION> Medstar </ORGANIZATION> crew speculated on the quick re-emergence of violence. `` The warm weather brings all this out,'' said paramedic <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Melville </PERSON>. `` Brings them out on the street. A little aggravation ... Bang, Bang.'' A homicide detective arrived with the patient, and the nurses track him down. Some blood-moistened undershorts have a bullet hole in them, and might be needed as evidence. `` When we cut their clothes off, we try not to cut through the bullet holes,'' says <PERSON> Diane </PERSON> <PERSON> Pickel </PERSON>, a nurse on <ORGANIZATION> Medstar </ORGANIZATION>'s two helicopters. Some of the paramedics speaking among themselves. Their discussion reveals how weary they are of all the shootings. <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Chappell </PERSON>, a flight paramedic handling the ambulance and helicopter communications on this night, says he can no longer count on a `` down time.'' The shootings `` used to be a nocturnal disease,'' he said. But now, `` It's night and day. Trauma does n't tell time anymore.'' Rev. <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Mayes </PERSON>, of the <ORGANIZATION> Van </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Buren </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Methodist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>, rotates the overnight shift with other community clergy. `` It's a frightful thing to see all of this,'' said <PERSON> Mayes </PERSON>, who comforts the families as best he can. The attending physician, Dr. <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Golocovsky </PERSON>, is back in <ORGANIZATION> Medstar </ORGANIZATION> by about 8:15. How did the fellow make out when he went upstairs? `` He did n't,'' <PERSON> Golocovsky </PERSON> said. The police identify the victim as <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Harden </PERSON>, 20, shot in an alleyway with a semi-automatic. Clean-up work is interrupted by a family's wailing, heard through the automatic double-doors. Members of the young man's family have gathered on the ambulance ramp, and the chaplain must be summoned to help comfort them _ elsewhere Shortly after 10 p.m., another 20-year-old man arrives with gunshot wounds to his chest. _ ^ By

<HEAD>A Day with the Mayor: The Subject Never Goes Away</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 For Mayor <PERSON> Marion </PERSON> <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, the questions these days are the same, whether he's talking to white businessmen or black reporters. What is he doing about the murders? And does he count drug dealers among his friends? As <PERSON> Barry </PERSON>, the first militant black civil rights leader to be elected mayor of a major <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> city, struggles to deal with the crisis in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, an undercurrent of rumors about his own alleged drug use undercut his credibility. While speaking at the <ORGANIZATION> Capitol </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> faced the same kind of questions from the group's mostly-black press corps that he complains the `` white media'' concentrate on. `` Mr. <PERSON> Mayor </PERSON>, if you had it to do over again, what mistakes would you acknowledge?'' asked <PERSON> Ethel </PERSON> <PERSON> Payne </PERSON>, who has worked for 30 years as a political columnist for the weekly <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> Afro-American. After refusing to admit having made any errors, <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> asked <PERSON> Payne </PERSON> for her opinion of him. `` I think you have a whole pile of stuff to contend with.'' <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> smiled uneasily; an uncomfortable silence settled over the room. <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> is under federal investigation for his ties to a drug suspect, <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>. Last December, city police abruptly called off an attempted undercover drug buy from <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>, a former city employee. <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> was in <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>' hotel room at the time and had been there often. Subsequently, <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> was arrested in the <LOCATION> Virgin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION> on charges he attempted to sell crack cocaine to undercover <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents. <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> has vehemently denied ever using drugs. He said he never saw <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> use drugs. `` The media is mixing up two scandals, the drug problem and all these things about me,'' he told the <ORGANIZATION> Capitol </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>. Earlier, a weary <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> tried to lecture on drugs at a school in the <ORGANIZATION> Shaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> neighborhood </ORGANIZATION>, one of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s most depressed communities.

 The youths figeted and talked among themselves. But they wer held spellbound by the next speaker, <PERSON> Glen </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>, a local radio personality, who railed against drug use. `` <PERSON> Glen </PERSON> sounded like he cared a little bit more about us,'' said 11-year-old <PERSON> Umi </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>. `` He sounded more sincere.'' <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> began his day at a fence-mending session with a prominent local business group whose members, including many past political supporters, have become increasingly nervous about the city's crime wave.

 The view of the police chief: `` <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION> is a safe city. It has a lower crime rate than 16 cities of comparable size.'' `` Those murders,'' says Chief <PERSON> Maurice </PERSON> <PERSON> Turner </PERSON>, referring to the record number of homicides in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, `` are occurring between the people who use drugs, who buy drugs, who sell drugs, who abuse drugs.'' He made those comments during a taping for public television station <ORGANIZATION> WETA </ORGANIZATION>. Deluged with press questions later, <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> conceded that, despite 4,300 arrests last year, his department has been unable to curb drug-related violence and may have to wait out the bloody turf wars. `` I do n't know what the hell we're going to do!'' he exclaimed. `` <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> went through this experience. <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> went through this experience. We're no different than any other community,'' said <PERSON> Turner </PERSON>. But police and criminologists in those cities say the district's drug battles are far deadlier `` Eventually, the turf will be divided,'' predicted <PERSON> Turner </PERSON>. `` They -LRB- the prevailing dealers -RRB- will go out and sell their drugs. People will pay their drug bills on time. And we're not going to have all of these shootings we have now.'' In the meantime, he said, the community must work together to reinforce strong values in young people. School board member <PERSON> Calvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Lockridge </PERSON> and local magazine publisher <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Regardie </PERSON> have charged that Mayor <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> has used drugs. About that, <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> says this: `` I've never asked the mayor, has he used drugs. I've never had any evidence that the mayor uses drugs. If I ever saw the mayor with drugs, he would be arrested.''

 Judge <PERSON> Ricardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Urbina </PERSON> looked sternly down at <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Spencer </PERSON>. `` The stuff you gave to the man on the corner for your friend _ you knew that was cocaine?'' he asked. `` Yes,'' <PERSON> Spencer </PERSON> replied. A routine morning in <ORGANIZATION> D.C. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. The charge: attempt to distribute cocaine. The plea: guilty. `` Your honor,'' Spencer's attorney began. <PERSON> Spencer </PERSON> is 53, she said. His prior offenses were minor. He had been a window cleaner for 34 years. The prosecuting attorney demurred; <PERSON> Spencer </PERSON> had a number of prior arrests, two prior drug convictions and had said he did n't think he had an addiction problem. Did Mr. <PERSON> Spencer </PERSON> care to speak? `` I do n't know too much about courts,'' he said. `` I have a 15-year-old daughter. She has nobody to direct her. ... I know I did wrong.'' <PERSON> Urbina </PERSON> barely paused before issuing sentence. Twenty to 60 months in jail, all but seven months suspended. Three years of probation, contingent on full-time employment and extensive drug testing _ once a week for the first year, twice a month for the second and at the discretion of the probation officer for the third. `` Good Luck,'' said the judge. `` Thank you, sir.'' Next. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Ray </PERSON>, dressed from head to toe in the phosphorescent orange jumpsuit issued by the <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION> jail, was charged with probation violations. `` Your honor,'' <PERSON> Ray </PERSON>'s attorney began. It's true <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> missed appointments and urine tests. But he had moved and was receiving mail late, and he had been hospitalized several times after being pushed out a third floor window. `` He assures me, your honor ... that he is drug-free at this point. In light of the circumstances, I simply ask you to allow him to continue on probation,'' the attorney said. `` I think we need more evidence,'' <PERSON> Urbina </PERSON> says. The hearing was rescheduled until hospital records and the probation officer could be present. Three flights down, those locked up over the Easter weekend filed three-by-three into the basement arraignment chamber. A fierce-looking young man with a bandage nearly covering his eye was released, contingent on drug screening and avoiding certain company. `` Stay away from Miss Stubbs,'' warned hearing commissioner <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Buxbaum </PERSON>. `` If you have anything to do with her, even a phone call to her place, I'll lock you up.'' Defendant after defendant shuffled up to the judge. `` No paper, the government drops the charges,'' the clerk said over and over. `` Thank God,'' a woman in a red down coat breathed as she filed out of the room.

 The man in a red <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Maryland </ORGANIZATION> sweatshirt and black knit cap covering his dreadlocks sat dazed on the curb in front of a pizza outlet. Dozens of onlookers, police and ambulance workers scurried around him. `` The mother -- -- -- shot me,'' he muttered over and over. `` Where were you shot?'' asked a paramedic after a cursory check revealed little. `` In my arm,'' said the man, finally indicating that it was his upper right arm. Paramedic <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Housley </PERSON> of Medic 1 sliced off the man's sleeve and he and fellow paramedic <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Bullock </PERSON> found the bullet hole. There was no exit wound, so they knew the bullet was somewhere inside. They strapped him onto a board and hoisted him into the ambulance. As <PERSON> Bullock </PERSON> prepared to insert an intravenous feeding to keep up his blood pressure, <PERSON> Housley </PERSON> put a stethoscope to his chest, trying to determine what internal damage had been caused. The man, whose gnarled hands and numerous scars indicated he'd seen lots of rough times in his 34 years _ although he said he'd `` only got shot once'' before _ was n't in the mood to He kept talking when <PERSON> Housley </PERSON> ordered that he only breathe. He admitted that he'd had `` lots of beers,'' but balked at <PERSON> Housley </PERSON>'s questions on drugs, questions that could determine what kind of medical treatment was called for. `` Look, I'm not the cops,'' <PERSON> Housley </PERSON> cajoled quietly. `` I'm not going to turn you in.'' He turned up the heat. `` I need to know if you do drugs, ever, anything. Ever smoke pot? Do horse? Play with needles? Do any Ecstacy?'' The man denied all. Another ambulance worker discovered rolling papers in the man's pocket `` If you do n't smoke pot, what are you doing with all these papers in your pocket?'' <PERSON> Housley </PERSON> asked, smiling ruefully and shaking his head. `` Just to have,'' the man replied. `` Just to have,'' <PERSON> Housley </PERSON> echoed quietly.

 The government is close to indicting <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> bond financier <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Milken </PERSON> and several other employees of the investment firm on securities fraud charges, sources say. Prosecutors have told lawyers for <PERSON> Milken </PERSON> and others their clients could be indicted this week, before civil fraud charges against the investment firm are settled, the sources said Tuesday, speaking on condition of anonymity. The long-awaited criminal indictment of the high-yield, or `` junk,'' bond wizard would mark a major change of the government's strategy in its more than two-year investigation of the Wall Street giant Defense attorneys had expected the indictment to follow a settlement between <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> of civil fraud charges, including insider trading, brought last year. The complaint names <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Milken </PERSON>; his brother, <PERSON> Lowell </PERSON>; two other <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> employees; and industrialist <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Posner </PERSON> and his son, <PERSON> Steven </PERSON>. But with negotiations stalled, <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> balking at government-ordered sanctions and the <ORGANIZATION> Milkens </ORGANIZATION> mounting legal challenges to the firm's proposed settlement, the <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney's office reportedly has decided to proceed with the case. Sources close to the situation said lawyers were told that the <ORGANIZATION> Milkens </ORGANIZATION> and at least two other <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> employees would be indicted this week. The sources cautioned that prosecutors had made similar statements in the past about pending indictments that never materialized. `` A number of the attorneys have been told that it's going to be this week,'' said an attorney for one of the targets. The sources said the government continues to call witnesses before a federal grand jury investigating <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION>'s activities. <PERSON> Milken </PERSON> last year received a target letter from the government indicating he would be indicted. The charges are expected to parallel the 184-page <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> complaint, which detailed 21 alleged fraud schemes between 1984 and late 1986. Many of the charges detail alleged wrongdoing between <PERSON> Milken </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON> <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON>, the now-jailed financier who paid $ 100 million to settle insider trading charges and tipped off prosecutors to other alleged fraud deals. The <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> settlement is a crucial pre-condition to a criminal plea bargain in which <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> is to plead guilty to six felonies and pay the government $ 650 million. <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> agreed to the pact in December to avoid racketeering charges that could have crippled the firm. Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Baird </PERSON>, who heads the office's securities fraud division, declined to comment on the <PERSON> Milken </PERSON> case <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Anreder </PERSON> said the company would not discuss negotiations in progress. A public relations firm hired by <PERSON> Milken </PERSON> declined to comment. Once <PERSON> Milken </PERSON> is indicted, the government would have 70 days to bring its case to trial unless a judge grants a delay or attorneys file motions further stalling the case. One attorney said the government has indicated it would bring a second wave of superceding indictments, contending that a first set of charges would be used as a pressure tactic to induce <PERSON> Milken </PERSON> and other defendants and witnesses to negotiate. An indictment also would shift focus from the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> negotiations, in which <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> has accused the government of requesting unfairly stringent measures against the firm and <PERSON> Milken </PERSON>. Negotiations reportedly stalled earlier this month when <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> Chief Executive <PERSON> Frederick </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> balked at a government demand to fire <PERSON> Milken </PERSON> before the settlement is completed. <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> already has agreed to fire <PERSON> Milken </PERSON> and withhold his multimillion-dollar 1988 pay as part of the criminal settlement. <PERSON> Milken </PERSON> is challenging the provision in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>, saying it violates his rights.

 As the paralyzing strike against <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> dragged through its fourth week and directors of its parent <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> prepared to meet again today, there was speculation that <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s future could be decided imminently. The board of directors of <ORGANIZATION> Trans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, meanwhile, met Tuesday amid mounting expectations that its owner and chairman, <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON>, could be poised to put a long-awaited bid for Eastern on the table. And there were indications that another group, led by outgoing Baseball Commissioner <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ueberroth </PERSON>, was outlining proposals to buy Miami-based <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>, which has been in bankruptcy protection from creditors since March 9. The <PERSON> Ueberroth </PERSON> offer, to be financed by <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, would be for $ 512 million and would give the Eastern unions a 30 percent equity stake in the airline in exchange for wage concessions, <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> reported in today's editions. <PERSON> Ueberroth </PERSON> has declined comment. <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> and his associates were unavailable for comment on the <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> board meeting late Tuesday and <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> refused even to acknowledge that its board was gathering. But there was speculation that the <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> directors could decide to remove Chairman <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON>, who has been under siege from <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s unions, or to take <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> private. Observers also speculated that <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION> banker <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pohlad </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> director, could join a bid by <PERSON> Ueberroth </PERSON>. <PERSON> Pohlad </PERSON>, who owns baseball's <ORGANIZATION> Minnesota </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Twins </ORGANIZATION>, reportedly brought <PERSON> Ueberroth </PERSON> in to negotiate the purchase of Eastern. <PERSON> Pohlad </PERSON> owns 12 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Jet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Capital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION>'s holding company. <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> owns 48.7 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Jet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Capital </ORGANIZATION>. In <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, meanwhile, <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> previewed its first post-strike training class for pilots Tuesday. The six-week course began Monday with fewer students than the airline projected. `` They had more or less hinted around that they were going to have 50 pilots, but in reality only 35 people showed up,'' <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Line </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pilots </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Hank </PERSON> <PERSON> Weber </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>. `` That's a drop in the bucket.'' Also Tuesday, unionized workers at four <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City-area </LOCATION> commuter railroads asked a federal appeals court to overturn a ban against their striking in sympathy with <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> employees. The court did not act immediately. An offer from <PERSON> Ueberroth </PERSON> for $ 300 million to $ 500 million may be presented to the <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> board in the next few days, airline industry and baseball sources said, speaking on condition of anonymity. <PERSON> Ueberroth </PERSON>'s term as baseball commissioner ends Saturday. The board was to hold regularly scheduled meetings Tuesday and today, said a source close to the company. But other sources said substantive discussions probably would n't begin until today. <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> spokesman Art Kent in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> said the company would n't comment on whether a board meeting was being held. Indications of <PERSON> Ueberroth </PERSON>'s interest came as takeover specialist <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> was reportedly resuming talks with <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s unions about a possible takeover. <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> has publicly expressed interest and has been supported by <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s unions. <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> was meeting again with union officials to discuss a possible takeover and hopes to use union concessions to persuade <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s creditors to let him take control, said <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Freeman </PERSON>, an investment banker with close ties to the <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> union. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Bankruptcy Trustee <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, administering <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s Chapter 11 reorganization in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, said Tuesday he was continuing to interview about a dozen candidates for Eastern bankruptcy examiner He said he hoped to recommend a candidate to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Bankruptcy Court Judge <PERSON> Burton </PERSON> <PERSON> Lifland </PERSON> by late this week or early next. <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> declined to name the candidates under consideration.

<HEAD>Northwest Says Group Interested In Takeover; Stock Price Soars</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TONY KENNEDY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The parent company of <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> says its board of directors has adopted a `` poison pill' anti-takeover defense to thwart a possible takeover attempt by an undiclosed investment group. <ORGANIZATION> NWA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> stock soared Tuesday to a price near its 52-week high after company officials revealed the proposal. The company said the investment group, which holds a 4.9 percent stake in <ORGANIZATION> NWA </ORGANIZATION>, recently notified Northwest of its `` interest in exploring the possibility of a negotiated leveraged acquisition.'' But it said, `` The company's board of directors has determined that the interests of the company, its employees, customers and shareholders will be best served by maintaining the company as an independent entity and has no intention of pursuing the indication of interest'' from the investment group. <ORGANIZATION> NWA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Whalen </PERSON> said he could not comment beyond the company's statement. Trading of <ORGANIZATION> NWA </ORGANIZATION> stock was temporarily halted on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> immediately after the announcement was made. When trading resumed, the price jumped from $ 60.75 a share to $ 69.50 in heavy trading and closed Tuesday at $ 70.25, up $ 9.62 -LCB-, near its 52-week high of $ 72.87 -LCB-. Despite Wall Street's enthusiasm, analysts reacted cautiously, noting that a formal offer for the nation's fifth-largest airline had not yet been announced. `` I hate to be skeptical, but I've seen too many -LRB- groups -RRB- indicate some special interest and then they dump their shares,'' said <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Marckesano </PERSON>, an airline stock analyst for <PERSON> Janney </PERSON> <PERSON> Montgomery </PERSON> <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>. `` If the group is legitimate and they have a legitimate offer in mind, they should come in with a tender offer.'' <PERSON> Kurt </PERSON> <PERSON> Rivard </PERSON>, a securities analyst for <ORGANIZATION> Dain </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bosworth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION>, said there is `` less than a 50-50 chance this company will be acquired.'' `` But that does n't mean someone wo n't try to make a run at them,'' he added. A leveraged buyout would leave the company with too much debt and impair the airline's ability to keep its fleet modern, <PERSON> Rivard </PERSON> said. Growing government resistance to consolidation of the airline industry reduces the chances of a successful buyout bid from a competitor of <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION>, he added. <PERSON> Whalen </PERSON> said he could not comment on whether the investment group has made a formal offer for a friendly takeover of the airline. Northwest would not reveal the identity of the investment group. The group's identity would be made public under <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> rules if it obtains 5 percent or more of <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION>'s stock. The price of <ORGANIZATION> NWA </ORGANIZATION> stock, like the stock of other airline companies, has been volatile in recent months amid takeover speculation. Several companies and individuals have been rumored as possible suitors for <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION>, including <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON>, <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Halvorson </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Line </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pilots </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, said Tuesday that the union had not been told the identity of the investment group. `` We have no notion at all,'' he said. <PERSON> Guy </PERSON> <PERSON> Cook </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Local </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> 143 </ORGANIZATION>, which represents nearly two-thirds of <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION>'s 35,000 employees, said that union would do whatever possible to prevent the airline from being taken over by someone who would break it up and sell it off. Monday's action by <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION>'s board of directors sets up an anti-takeover defense that would make <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> less attractive to a hostile suitor intending to break up the company, said <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Gibbons </PERSON>, a company spokesman. Under the `` poison pill'' plan, shareholders will have the chance to buy one one-hundredth of a share of a new series of preferred stock for $ 225 when a person or group acquires 15 percent of common stock or announces a tender offer that would result in ownership of 15 percent or more of the voting power. The initial takeover price for a hostile suitor would n't increase because of the new stock, but the acquiring person or group would not be able to reap benefits from the sale of assets following the takeover, <PERSON> Gibbons </PERSON> said Under the `` poison pill,'' the new owners would have to distribute income from the sale of assets to holders of the preferred stock, <PERSON> Gibbons </PERSON> said. He said many other American companies have similar anti-takeover defenses. `` This is a plan designed to ensure that our constituents are best served by any offer that we may get,'' <PERSON> Whalen </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> NWA </ORGANIZATION> reported 1988 record earnings of $ 135.1 million, or $ 4.63 a share, up 31.1 percent from $ 103 million, or $ 3.59 a share, in 1987. In August 1986, <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> acquired rival <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> for $ 884 million.

<HEAD>Appeals Court To Decide If Railroad Workers Can Strike In Sympathy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN M. DOYLE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A federal appeals court reserved ruling on a request by unionized workers at four metropolitan area commuter railroads to overturn a ban against their striking in sympathy with <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> employees. Lawyers for the railroads argued Tuesday before the three-member panel of the 2nd <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> that the Railway Labor Act requires the railroad employees to stay on the job until they go through a series of mediation steps. Until the 2nd Circuit decides otherwise, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Patterson </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>'s injunctions against sympathy strikes remain in force. At issue is whether unionized workers at the <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rail </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Road </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> NJ </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transit </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Metro-North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commuter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Railroad </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION> may honor picket lines set up by machinists who struck Eastern on March 4. Both the unions and the railroads agree that if all or most union workers honored the machinists' picket lines, the four railroads would have to shut down, throwing transportation facilities into chaos for more than 400,000 daily commuters in the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> metropolitan area. On March 20, <PERSON> Patterson </PERSON> barred the railroad unions from honoring the picket lines and ordered union officials to tell their members to go to work if any picket lines went up at railroad facilities. `` We have been stripped of the most fundamental right that labor has: to withdraw its services and to call upon other workers to withdraw their services,'' <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Guerrieri </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, lawyer for the unions, told the appeals panel. He claimed that because the railroad workers have no dispute with their own employers they would not have to go through the numerous steps required by the Railway Labor Act before walking off the job in a sympathy strike. But <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Plum </PERSON>, lawyer for the <ORGANIZATION> LIRR </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Metro-North </ORGANIZATION>, said the Railway Labor Act encompassed all disputes and to claim workers could strike if they said there was no dispute `` defies logic.''

Suitors could include German, Japanese or other foreign companies that want a foothold in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> automobile equipment market and currently enjoy a currency-exchange advantage, <PERSON> Viscogliosi </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Rosenberg </PERSON> declined to comment on what changes <ORGANIZATION> Terex </ORGANIZATION> plans for Fruehauf employees and plants. Elsewhere, efficiency has ruled when the maker of heavy-duty, off-road earth-moving equipment has acquired troubled companies and brought them to profitability, he said. `` We have focused on manufacturing efficiencies, looking at their strengths, where their profits lie, and making sure they are not overburdened with large overcapacity,'' he said. Other <ORGANIZATION> Terex </ORGANIZATION> units such as <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineering </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Green </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Unit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rig </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Tulsa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Okla. </LOCATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> Koehring </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cranes </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Excavators </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> were in financial trouble when acquired, <PERSON> Rosenberg </PERSON> said. `` They are all now profitable.'' <PERSON> Viscogliosi </PERSON> said shocks and adjustments are likely but predicted a favorable outcome. `` I would think it would be a plus in terms of morale for the employees. They're finally going to get out from under,'' he said. <PERSON> Fruehauf </PERSON> had been reviewing several acquisition proposals, including one from <ORGANIZATION> Varity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION> farm equipment maker that used to be called <ORGANIZATION> Massey-Ferguson </ORGANIZATION>, that was withdrawn Feb. 27, <PERSON> Hladik </PERSON> said. Negotiations between <ORGANIZATION> Terex </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Fruehauf </PERSON> intensified in the past week and were concluded Monday night, <PERSON> Rosenberg </PERSON> said. Fruehauf has sold off divisions and recently proposed a recapitalization plan in the wake of the 1986 leveraged buyout that created more than $ 1 billion in debt. Fruehauf managers arranged the buyout with the financial help of <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, which obtained a 31 percent voting interest, to avoid a takeover bid by <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> investor <PERSON> Asher </PERSON> <PERSON> Edelman </PERSON>. <PERSON> Edelman </PERSON> sold his Fruehauf stock at a profit and also received a $ 21 million payment from the company. Fruehauf, which employs about 15,800 people, reported losses of $ 41.5 million on revenue of $ 1.96 billion in 1987 and losses of $ 56.5 million on revenue of $ 2.09 billion in 1988.

<TEXT>
 Makers of apple sauces and juices presented test results today showing the products to be virtually free of Alar, a chemical that environmentalists say heightens the risk of cancer in children. The Processed <ORGANIZATION> Apple </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, which represents most of the producers of apple sauces and juices, said today tests covering 4,623 samples and a cross-section of brand names revealed only eight cases in which detectable levels of Alar were found in the product. <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Davenport </PERSON>, executive director of the Atlanta-based trade association, said a detectable level meant a trace of at least 1 part per million in the sample, or 20 times below the tolerance level established by the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>. `` We're talking about truly insignificant levels here,'' <PERSON> Davenport </PERSON> said Tuesday in a telephone interview. There has been widespread concern reported among parents in recent weeks over the health effects of chemicals used on apples. A report by the <ORGANIZATION> Natural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, a private environmental group, concluded last month that children are especially at risk from such chemicals because they eat a much larger volume of apples and other fruits and vegetables compared to their weight than do adults. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Agriculture Commissioner <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> McGuire </PERSON>, whose state ranks second behind <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> in apple production, today termed apples `` totally safe,'' with alar found on only about 20 percent and, in those cases, well below levels that cause concern. `` The issue is larger than alar,'' <PERSON> McGuire </PERSON> said on `` CBS This Morning.'' `` Let me say that the concern of agriculture in general is the removal of many of the other pesticides, many of the other chemicals that we use in agriculture, which makes it possible to feed the poor people of the world.'' Asked whether growers can by without alar, <PERSON> McGuire </PERSON> said: `` They certainly can, and if across the country they do they'll have poorer quality apples, a short supply in the late winter and spring months until the next season comes around.'' But <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Feldman </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Against </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Misuse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chemicals </ORGANIZATION>, contended on the <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> broadcast that `` alar is dangerous,'' especially in combination with many other chemicals used on foods. `` We're, in a sense, assaulting an American through his or her daily diet when we sit down at the dinner table,'' he said. Alar, technically known as daminozide, was singled out by the <ORGANIZATION> NRDC </ORGANIZATION> study, although industry and government officials have said only from 5 percent to 10 percent of apples are sprayed with the chemical. Alar regulates growth and increases shelf life. <PERSON> Daminozide </PERSON> has been found to cause cancer in test animals, and the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> has said it intends to ban its use. But the regulatory process could take several years. <PERSON> Davenport </PERSON> said that the test results assembled by the institute were from tests conducted on apple sauce and juice from 1987 to the present in four states _ <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> _ by regulatory agencies, independent testing laboratories and processors. Of the 4,623 samples, eight had traces of Alar of at least 1 part per million with the highest residue being 1.3 parts per million, said <PERSON> Davenport </PERSON>. He said the samples represents brands across the board, including all the major brands such as <PERSON> Mott </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Seneca </LOCATION>, and Tree Top. `` This study confirms that ... the industry has successfully screened Alar from its products,'' said <PERSON> Hugh </PERSON> <PERSON> Ewart </PERSON>, chairman of the processor group's technical committee. Most apple processors began putting growers on notice in 1986 that they did not want apples that had been treated with Alar, but <PERSON> Davenport </PERSON> said traces of the chemical continue to be found because the chemical stays in the trees.

 <ORGANIZATION> Trans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> has announced plans to update and expand its fleet with the purchase of up to 40 <ORGANIZATION> Airbus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industrie </ORGANIZATION> jetliners in a deal worth more than $ 3.6 billion _ the latest in a series of big aircraft purchases by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> airlines. <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's eighth-largest air carrier, said Tuesday it had placed firm orders for twenty A330-300 wide-body aircraft, with options to purchase 20 more of the twin-engine planes. The two companies said in a statement <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> could convert up to half the ordered planes and half the optioned jets to A340s, <ORGANIZATION> Airbus </ORGANIZATION>' four-engine, long-range wide-body aircraft. <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> had been expected to announce an order since last October, when it said it would lease or buy 60 new narrow-bodied aircraft. The airline's chairman, <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON>, said Tuesday the company also plans to buy narrow-bodied planes in the future. Business has been booming recently for domestic and foreign aircraft manufacturers. Over the past two months, <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> announced up to $ 14 billion in aircraft purchases planned through 1994, including planes by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> companies <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> McDonnell-Douglas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and the Dutch manufacturer <ORGANIZATION> Fokker </ORGANIZATION>. In January, <ORGANIZATION> Braniff </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> said it would buy up to 100 Airbus 320 jets in a deal that could reach $ 3.5 billion. <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> said in an interview that <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION>'s new planes would be used to expand its fleet and replace older aircraft. <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> said the carrier's planes have an average age of 12.5 years. <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION>'s unions have complained in recent years about its aging planes, contending that <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> had agreed to upgrade the fleet in acquiring the airline in 1986. But <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> denied Tuesday that the <ORGANIZATION> Airbus </ORGANIZATION> purchase resulted from any union pressure to revitalize the <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> fleet. <ORGANIZATION> Airbus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industrie </ORGANIZATION> said it expected to begin delivering the A330s to <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> in late 1994 or early 1995. <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> said it would use the planes, which seat 301 passengers each, on major <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> and trans-Atlantic routes. <ORGANIZATION> Airbus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industrie </ORGANIZATION>, owned by a European consortium, is a major competitor of <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> McDonnell-Douglas </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commercial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airplanes </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> said his company had competed for the <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> order with its 767 widebody twin-jet plane. In the past, <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> has been a good <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> customer, buying the company's 727s, 747s and 767s in its fleet. It currently has no <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> planes on order. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Whitlow </PERSON>, who follows <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> for the investment firm <ORGANIZATION> Dain </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bosworth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>, said, `` I suspect that <ORGANIZATION> Airbus </ORGANIZATION> maybe had some fairly attractive terms in terms of price and financing.'' `` <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION>'s not going to win them all,'' he said, referring to <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> announcements so far this year of orders for 102 aircraft worth more than $ 8.2 billion, on top of last year's record orders for 636 jets worth $ 29.7 billion. <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Friedman </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, said he doubted <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION>'s backlog of orders was a factor in the <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> purchase. `` They would have been able to get 767s by 1994,'' when the A330s are scheduled to be delivered, he said. <ORGANIZATION> McDonnell-Douglas </ORGANIZATION> had no comment on the TWA-Airbus deal, said <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Hanson </PERSON>, a spokesman for the company's <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aircraft </ORGANIZATION> division. But, he added, `` <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> has been a good customer of ours for our MD-80s and we expect that good and fruitful relationship to continue ...'' The narrow-body MD-80s are among <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION>'s newer planes. <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> took <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> private last October. In the third quarter of 1988, the company reported earnings of $ 88 million, up from $ 57.1 million a year earlier, while its revenue rose to $ 1.27 billion from $ 1.21 billion. The company has not yet released fourth-quarter figures, but a <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> source said earnings rose during the period.

 Stock prices rose early today as the dollar held its ground against further intervention by major central banks. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks, which rose more than 30 points in the first two sessions this week, was up 4.70 at 2,280.24 as of 10 a.m. on Wall Street.

The announcement had little apparent effect on the market, which has been paying more attention to the value of the dollar. The central banks of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> were reportedly selling dollars today to put a lid on the currency's recent rise The dollar's strength has come about from expectations that the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> will raise interest rates to stem inflation. High rates are attractive to foreign investors. The governor of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s central bank was quoted as saying that dollar buying has been `` overdone'' and that the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> would intervene if necessary to stem the dollar's further rise against the yen.

<HEAD>Coffee Producers Meet Ahead Of Key Talks with Consumers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Representatives from major coffee producing countries will meet here later this week to discuss strategy for talks with consuming countries on the future of international cooperation to stabilize world prices. The 25 producing countries belonging to the <ORGANIZATION> Inter-African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coffee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> will meet here Thursday and Friday, and the 11-nation group of producers of the top-quality mild arabica type of coffee will meet separately on Friday. Delegates from both groups said Wednesday that a joint meeting of all 50 <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coffee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> producer members was unlikely ahead of Monday's start of two weeks of talks with the body's 25 key consuming countries. This joint meeting is the last scheduled attempt to negotiate a new international price-stabilization agreement to replace the present one which expires at the end of September. Producers were expected to make proposals for the new pact at the joint meeting, said <PERSON> Jorge </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s permanent coffee representative here. <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> also is the spokesman for a third group of mild arabica coffee producers known as the `` others.'' Members of this group include <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>. His group's meeting will `` probably translate into a proposal'' aimed at increasing its share of the market under a new pact, <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> said. Delegates said that a fight to increase market share would bring the `` others'' into conflict with most African countries and with <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>. They produce types of coffee less popular with consumers, but are anxious to hold on to present market shares. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> want any new coffee pact to increase the participation of `` other'' milds in the market. Like the present coffee agreement, any new deal would probably use export quotas to regulate supply and prices.

 The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> is dropping its opposition to <ORGANIZATION> Consolidated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Freightways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>'s acquisition of <ORGANIZATION> Emery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Freight </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, saying it is unlikely a more acceptable buyer for the troubled company can be found. The decision Tuesday removed antitrust obstacles to the deal, under which Consolidated, based in <LOCATION> Menlo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, agreed last month to buy Wilton-based Emery for $ 230 million. The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> recently asked <PERSON> Emery </PERSON> to contact more than 20 parties the company identified last year as potential buyers to see if any were interested, because of concerns the Consolidated deal would curtail competition in the overnight air-freight industry. In a statement issued from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rule </PERSON>, assistant attorney general in charge of the antitrust division, said the department still believed the acquisition would likely prove anticompetitive, noting that the industry is dominated by only four carriers. But, Rule said, `` After a thorough investigation, we concluded that if the department tried to challenge the proposed acquisition, <PERSON> Emery </PERSON> would be successful in establishing a failing firm defense under the antitrust laws.'' Under the failing firm doctrine, an otherwise anticompetitive acquisition is not unlawful if two requirements are met: The company being acquired must show that it will not be able to meet its financial obligations through the use of existing assets and that it probably would not emerge from a restructuring or reorganization as a viable competitor. The company must also show that no other buyer that would represent less of a threat to competition is willing to purchase its assets. `` We are pleased we have cleared this last regulatory requirement,'' <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> Bertrand </PERSON>, an Emery spokeswoman, said today. `` Both companies ... are anxious to get the merger completed. Consolidated extended its tender offer until midnight Friday. Industry analysts said it could have spelled the end of Emery if the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> had blocked the sale. <PERSON> Emery </PERSON> lost $ 51 million last year after losing $ 48 million in 1987. `` Emery is going to get acquired or it is going to go bankrupt,'' said <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Legg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mason </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wood </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Walker </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION>. `` Emery is a mess,'' he said. `` It's losing a lot of money and if Consolidated Freight cuts it loose, it will lose a lot more money.'' None of the companies being contacted had previously made an offer for <PERSON> Emery </PERSON> and analysts doubted that another buyer would be found. `` It's a very troubled company,'' said <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Morris </PERSON>, an analyst with <PERSON> Prescott </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Ball </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Turben </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION>. `` There were n't any people stepping up to the plate out of the 20 surveyed. I would doubt very much anything will be changed.'' <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> noted that Consolidated is getting all of Emery for $ 230 million, just two years after <PERSON> Emery </PERSON> bought <ORGANIZATION> Purolator </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Courier </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> for $ 348 million. `` That should tell you something about the company and how it's been doing,'' he said <PERSON> Emery </PERSON>'s operations are to be merged with those of Consolidated's <ORGANIZATION> CF </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Freight </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> unit into a new company to be called <ORGANIZATION> Emery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Worldwide </ORGANIZATION> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> said the acquisition would give Consolidated 40 percent to 50 percent of the overnight air-freight business compared to its current 20 percent share. `` There's more than enough competition out there,'' he said. `` Consolidated Freight is acquiring a very good market position, but they are not acquiring a monopoly.'' Consolidated agreed to buy all outstanding Emery common stock for $ 7.75 a share in cash and all outstanding Emery preferred stock for $ 21.10 a share in stock. As of Tuesday, Consolidated said that 89 percent of the common shares and 75 percent of the preferred stock had been tendered.

<HEAD>Crop Futures Creep Higher On Stronger Export Demand</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Grain and soybean futures prices crept higher this morning on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>, reflecting increased export demand apparently prompted by a sharp decline in prices earlier this week. Soybean futures were supported in early trading by indications that the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> had made a substantial purchase of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> soybean meal earlier in the week. Corn and wheat futures opened fractionally lower following the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s announcement late Tuesday that the Soviets had bought 550,000 metric tons of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> corn _ much less than the 2 million metric tons that had been rumored during Tuesday's session. But grain futures quickly turned higher on news of increased export demand for wheat, including interest by <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>. Some traders also remained optimistic that the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> would announce further corn sales to the Soviets.

 Former <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Volcker </PERSON> today called inflation `` a perpetual concern'' and praised recent actions by the the nation's central bank to nudge up interest rates to combat rising prices. <PERSON> Volcker </PERSON>, speaking with reporters at the White House, voiced particular praise for the policies of the current <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> chairman, <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON>. `` The inflation rate has been going up some, and I think we ought to deal with it,'' said <PERSON> Volcker </PERSON>. As <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> chairman, <PERSON> Volcker </PERSON> earned a reputation as the government's chief inflation fighter in the early 1980s when he pursued a policy of tight credit that drove up interest rates in a successful effort to break the back of inflation spiraling in the double digits For the first two months of 1989, inflation at the consumer price level has been rising at an annual rate of 6.1 percent. At the wholesale level, prices have been rising at a 12.6 percent annual rate. <PERSON> Volcker </PERSON>, who stepped down from the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> in 1987 when his term as chairman expired, said, `` The economy has been doing pretty well, it keeps growing. What more can I say?'' Asked directly about inflation, <PERSON> Volcker </PERSON> said, `` When you talk to me, I think inflation is a perpetual concern. So I'm delighted to see the concern about inflation openly expressed. I'm delighted to see what Mr. <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> has bene saying about it.'' <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> has argued that higher interest rates are needed in the short run to keep a lid on inflation _ a position that has put him at odds with President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who has said he does not share quite the degree of concern over current inflation that <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> does. `` I think Mr. <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> is well able to take care of himself in making those judgments'' on interest rates, <PERSON> Volcker </PERSON> said. He also expressed support of current steps taken by `` the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION>, generally.'' <PERSON> Volcker </PERSON> was at the White House to discuss with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> the final report of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, which has recommended pay increases of approximately 50 percent over two years for top federal officials. <PERSON> Volcker </PERSON> is chairman of the commission.

 <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday announced a new incentive program with interest rates as low as 2.9 percent, 2 percentage points lower than the program it replaces. The last time automakers' financing companies offered interest rates as low as 2.9 percent was in mid-1987. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Rewey </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>'s vice president for North American sales, said the nation's No. 2 automaker made the move because car and truck sales during the first 80 days of the year fell below projections. <PERSON> Rewey </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> had lowered its annual sales prediction for the industry to 15 million cars and trucks from 15.4 million he talked about in early February. Sales during the first 80 days of the year worked out to an annual rate of 14.6 million vehicles, he added. Although consumer confidence in the economy remains high, <PERSON> Rewey </PERSON> said, car buyers have been hesitating because of recent moves by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> and large banks that have pushed up interest rates. `` There has to be concern of the very rampant move of interest rates in the first quarter -LRB- of 1989 -RRB-,'' he said at a news conference. The prime lending rate, a benchmark rate on which many other interest charges are based, has increased by 1 percentage point to 11.5 percent this year. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>'s new incentive program, which expires May 31, offers consumers the option of cash rebates, ranging from $ 300 to $ 4,000 or financing as low as 2.9 percent for a two-year loan, depending on model. The deals are being offered on various cars carrying <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> and Mercury nameplates and on some Ford trucks. <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> also offer rebates or low interest rate incentives on a variety of their cars and trucks. Some of the <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> offers expire as early as Monday. <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION>'s incentives run indefinitely There was no immediate move by <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> or <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> to match <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>'s new incentive package

 Prices were little changed on Wall Street today after the government released economic figures that were in line with the stock market's expectations.

 What this country needs is an <PERSON> Emily </PERSON> <PERSON> Post </PERSON> for facsimile machines, electronic mail, voice messaging, squawk boxes and car phones. Technology has outraced etiquette in these new forms of business communication, producing such modern plagues as junk fax and the dead-end phone calls to machines known as `` voice mail jail.'' Consider these horror stories of bad manners and simple ineptitude: _ An overzealous sandwich shop operator faxed his menu to a top <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> state official at the very moment the official was trying to send an urgent memo to Gov <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON>. _ The <ORGANIZATION> Wall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Street </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> bureau had a scoop fall into its lap when someone accidentally sent a secret takeover proposal to its fax machine _ The Iran-contra affair unraveled, Watergate-like, when investigators discovered a treasure trove of electronic mail messages sent by Lt. Col. <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON> and his compatriots on an internal computer system Unknown to the North group, every message had been stored on computer tape. _ In <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, according to the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>, a man pressed the wrong buttons on his phone and sent a private voice love message to his entire department These cases may not all involve questions of etiquette in the narrow sense, but they do show that the business world has not worked out a comfortable modus vivendi with its own new machinery. True, technology is beginning to solve the problems it created. For example, <ORGANIZATION> Forbes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> magazine </ORGANIZATION> says future software will be able to screen sales pitches from legitimate electronic mail by looking for telltale words like `` insurance'' and `` financial planner.'' Still, the time has come for a seasoned practicioner of good manners and good sense to spell out certain rules of behavior. Because no one like that has stepped forward, here are some suggestions for now for 10 Tentative Communication Commandments: I. Thou shalt not send unrequested material by fax machine. If thou must disobey this commandment, thou shalt at least keep thy junk faxes short and send them during off hours. II. Thou shalt not have a machine answering thy company's main phone line, even if it does have a pleasant voice. People will hang up. III. Thou shalt provide an escape route from `` voice mail jail'' so a caller entrapped in thy system can get back to a human operator at any time. IV. Thou shalt not clutter thy neighbors' electronic mailboxes simply because it is easy to code them in on messages. V. Thou shalt remember when firing off a message by voice or electronic mail that words can sting and ill-considered words could come back to haunt thee. VI. If thou insists on sending a back-stabbing message, thou shalt make sure it is going to the intended recipient and not to the person whose back is being stabbed. VII. Thou shalt not put a caller on a speaker phone, broadcasting his or her voice around the room, unless the caller agrees to this invasion of privacy. VIII. Thou shalt prevent embarrassment by informing the caller on a squawk box who else is in the room listening to the conversation. IX. Thou shalt not discuss sensitive matters by car phone unless thou art willing to have others listening in by scanner. X. Above all, thou shalt never, in all thy days, refer to talking as `` real-time interfacing.''

<HEAD>Airline Buccaneer Donald Burr: People Express Founder Ready to Make
A Move</HEAD>

 <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Burr </PERSON> built one of the biggest airlines from scratch using ultra-cheap fares to draw millions of customers, only to see his empire collapse six years later. Now he could be ready to make a comeback. <PERSON> Burr </PERSON>, 47, founder of defunct <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, has started to talk to the press after two years of shunning public view. He has re-emerged at a time when <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, paralyzed by a strike and in bankruptcy protection from creditors, is tottering on extinction. Could <PERSON> Burr </PERSON> be putting himself forward as a `` white knight'' manager to help rescue Eastern, or gearing up to start a new airline to replace it? He's dodging the question, but circumstantial evidence indicates the answer is yes. <PERSON> Burr </PERSON>'s formal agreement not to compete against former boss <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> has just effectively expired. <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON>, steely chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> which controls <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>, bought a battered <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> from <PERSON> Burr </PERSON> in September 1986 for $ 300 million. At its zenith in 1985, <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION>, N.J.-based <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> was a wildly successful product of airline deregulation, offering discount fares to 150 cities and pulling in more than $ 1 billion a year in revenue. `` I'm trying to find a way to reinvent the -LRB- airline -RRB- product again,'' <PERSON> Burr </PERSON> said in an interview. Besides lecturing at universities and writing a book about <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> during the past two years, <PERSON> Burr </PERSON> said he has informally looked at a few potential new airline deals. Industry sources say he spoke with <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> before the Eastern strike about the possibility of running the carrier. <PERSON> Burr </PERSON> would only say that he's had `` conceptual'' talks with the <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> chief. <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> has refused to comment. What if the rebellious unions at Miami-based <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> approached him to help take over or run the airline? `` I'd have to consider it,'' he said. <PERSON> Burr </PERSON> talks with evangelical enthusiasm about the airline industry, whether he's reminiscing about triumphs and travails of <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> or looking forward to the next chapter of deregulation. It's a talent he's honed on the lecture circuit, where he commands $ 10,000 a speech. `` The airlines are on the verge of unprecedented profitability,'' he said, perched on the edge of a chair at the <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> in midtown <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>. `` I would love to see the airline industry evolve toward high-commitment service organizations.'' <PERSON> Burr </PERSON>'s career path, and life, have been closely intertwined with <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON>'s __ he even served as best man at <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON>'s wedding in 1972. They are only a year apart in age and were both born in May under the sign of Taurus, the bull. Yet their personalities seem poles apart. With his boyish good looks and disarming ebullience, <PERSON> Burr </PERSON> is a study in contrasts with the gaunt, fierce-looking <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON>, who has become a leading target of organized labor because of his avowed anti-union strategies. <PERSON> Burr </PERSON>, born in suburban <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Windsor </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, has been described by people in the industry as a preppie entrepreneur. <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON>, 48, grew up in tough, street-wise <LOCATION> Queens </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION> People familiar with the two personalities find it difficult to imagine <PERSON> Burr </PERSON> working for <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON>, which he did twice, and fencing with him in one of the most brutally competitive businesses of the 1980s. They both attended <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, where <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> got his MBA in 1963 and <PERSON> Burr </PERSON> received his in 1965. <PERSON> Burr </PERSON> then went to work as a financial analyst for <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> investment company, while <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> was an analyst for <ORGANIZATION> Trans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and later for Eastern. <PERSON> Burr </PERSON> was elected president of <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> in 1971 _ two years after <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> created <ORGANIZATION> Jet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Capital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, the aircraft leasing company that was to become the core of <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION>. In 1973, after <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> acquired ailing <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, he recruited <PERSON> Burr </PERSON>, whose <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> had been an investor in <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON>'s takeover <PERSON> Burr </PERSON> became president of <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>, where he helped Chairman <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> introduce discount `` Peanut Fares'' that revolutionized the industry and made the airline the fastest-growing <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> carrier. In January 1980, <PERSON> Burr </PERSON> left <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> to take advantage of the 1978 deregulation of the industry that let airlines set their own fares and fly where they wished. He started his own low-cost airline, <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION>, which created an enormous new market of air travelers with a pay-on-board, lug-your-own bags approach that made his planes the Greyhound buses of the sky. After a quick takeoff and supersonic growth, <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> eventually crashed as big competitors undercut <PERSON> Burr </PERSON>'s discount fares to prevent him from taking away their customers. After it was sold to what was now <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> in September 1986, <PERSON> Burr </PERSON> went back to work for <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON>, but not for long. He is careful not to join the Lorenzo-bashing that has become so popular. The strongest thing <PERSON> Burr </PERSON> will say about <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> is he's a `` low-cost warhound.'' <PERSON> Burr </PERSON> says he's too busy thinking about what he calls `` reinventing the product'' to dwell on the past. But as for whether he's preparing to fill a void created if Eastern disappears, <PERSON> Burr </PERSON> is evasive. `` I'm after the same thing I've been after my whole lifetime,'' he said.

 Energy futures prices were mixed in early trading today, with crude oil regaining some of the ground lost in Tuesday's selloff. By noon on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, the May contract for West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark grade of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> crude, was up 11 cents at $ 20.02. On Tuesday, the May crude oil contract had settled at $ 19.91 a barrel, down 62 cents from Monday's close. In reaction to the Alaskan oil spill that temporarily closed a major port, the contract had gone up 38 cents a barrel Monday to close at $ 20.53, the highest level since Aug. 14, 1987, when it settled at $ 20.57. Among refined petroleum products traded on the exchange today, heating oil for April delivery was down 0.24 cent to 54.80 cents a gallon and the April unleaded gasoline contract was up 0.52 cent at 59.20 cents a gallon after two hours of trading. Analysts blamed Tuesday's decline largely on profit-taking and concerns about whether <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> ministers will ease production restraints during their meeting in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> this week. The April contract for wholesale home heating oil plunged on Tuesday by 2.54 cents closing at 55.04 cents a gallon, after rising 1.06 cents Monday. April unleaded gasoline, which gained 1.73 cents in the previous session, settled down 1.07 cents to 58.68 cents a gallon. Monday's rally was triggered by the accident off the <LOCATION> Alaskan </LOCATION> port of <LOCATION> Valdez </LOCATION>, where an <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> tanker ran aground and spilled an estimated 10.1 million gallons of crude oil into Prince <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sound </PERSON>. The accident forced the closing of the port, temporarily cutting <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> crude supplies by a quarter. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Beutel </PERSON>, an energy analyst at <ORGANIZATION> Elders </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Futures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, said the market sold off Tuesday because prices had risen too high, too fast in the previous session. `` I think the market was overbought,'' he said. `` People are now cashing in.'' Also depressing oil prices were worries that the <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exporting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Countries </ORGANIZATION> might loosen its production quota to help slow recent price increases at its regular meeting in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>. `` It introduced an era of uncertainty that did n't exist before,'' said <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Byers </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Bear </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stearns </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> ministers were upbeat about the strong crude market but reluctant to predict that longer-term prices would continue their recent climb, which has seen WTI rising by some $ 5 a barrel since last October The 13 member nations agreed last fall to limit their total output to 18.5 million barrels a day in the first half of this year to support a price of $ 18 a barrel.

<TEXT>
 The government's chief economic forecasting gauge dropped 0.3 percent in February after posting sharp gains during the previous two months, the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said today. February's decline in the department's Index of Leading Economic Indicators was the first drop since a similar dip last September and the largest since a 0.8 percent drop last July. It was in line with widespread expectations that the economy will slow this year. The leading index, designed to foretell economic activity six to nine months into the future, had advanced 0.6 percent in December and 0.7 percent in January after vacillating during much of 1988. With labor markets tight and factories operating close to peak capacity, analysts say some slowdown is needed to keep the economy from overheating and inflation from spiraling. However, analysts are divided over whether the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> can successfully engineer a controlled slowdown that restrains economic growth just enough to ease inflation without causing a recession. The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> for a year has been pushing up interest rates in order to relieve inflationary pressures, and it intensified those efforts after sharp price increases were recorded in January and February. At the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, presidential press secretary <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> pointed to the index's increase at an annual average rate of 1.5 percent since August 1988 and 3.5 percent since February 1988. `` The trend is still upward and one month's figures do n't provide a real basis for judging any change in that trend,'' he said In another report today showing the impact of higher interest rates, the government reported that sales of new, single-family homes plunged 9.4 percent in February to the lowest level in more than a year. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said sales retreated to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 626,000 in February, following a 2.5 percent increase in January and a 3.7 percent gain in December. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> also sought to minimize the housing statistics, saying, `` Monthly housing sales vary substantially.'' He said the figures also reflected higher interest rates and `` probably some slowing in the economy.'' <PERSON> Irwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Kellner </PERSON>, chief economist for <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hanover </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, said in advance of today's report that the jagged behavior of the leading index suggests `` the economy has been slowing down from its overheated pace and that the economy is continuing to slow down as we work our way into the second quarter of 1989.'' <PERSON> Kellner </PERSON> said that despite the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION>'s efforts to prolong the life of the economic expansion even as it restrains growth, `` the odds are growing each day'' that the central bank will push the nation into a recession. In February, eight of the 11 indicators that make up the leading index declined, with the biggest negative factor being a drop in manufacturer orders for new plants and equipment. The other negative factors were a drop in building permits, a decline in manufacturers' orders for consumer goods, a contraction in the money supply, a dip in an index of consumer expectations, an increase in initial claims for unemployment benefits, faster vendor deliveries to companies signaling slower demand and a decline in manufacturers' unfilled orders. Two indicators made positive contributions: an increase in prices for raw materials indicating stronger demand, and rising stock prices. One indicator was unchanged last month: the length of the average work week. The various changes left the index at 145.2 percent of its 1982 base of 100. Over the past 12 months, the index has risen 3.5 percent, after climbing 2.4 percent over the previous 12-month period. The economy began the new year with strong momentum, but a number of government reports on its performance in February pointed downward, including drops in retail sales, housing construction, orders for durable goods, manufacturing employment and factory operating rates. Economist <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Levy </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Levy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forecasts </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chappaqua </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, said that with evidence of an economic slowdown likely to mount, the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> probably will ease its grip on the money supply by mid-year. `` The probability is very good that we will avoid a recession,'' <PERSON> Levy </PERSON> said. The traditional signal of an oncoming recession is three straight declines in the leading index. The components of the composite index were revised last month to improve its forecasting abilities, but when the new index is applied retroactively, it flashes two false recession signals since the 1981-82 economic downturn. The economy grew a robust 3.9 percent in 1988, the best showing in four years, but most private analysts expect the gross national product to expand only by about 2.7 percent this year, slowed by higher interest rates and a worsening of the trade deficit. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is counting on a 3.2 percent GNP gain to allow the administration to reduce the federal budget deficit without raising taxes, but few economists believe the administration's GNP forecast is realistic.

<HEAD>London Shares Close Mixed, Shrug Off Wider Trade Gap</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Share prices managed to shrug off news of a widening British trade gap Wednesday, recovering in the afternoon to end the day mixed. Equities dipped sharply immediately after release of a report showing the current account deficit widened in February to 1.696 billion pounds -LRB- $ 2.88 billion -RRB- from a revised 1.599 billion-pound -LRB- $ 2.72 billion -RRB- shortfall in January. But after more consideration, analysts attributed the worse-than-expected report to erratic items and predicted the trade report would n't add to pressure for higher British interest rates. The market had been expecting a February current account deficit of 1.45 billion pounds -LRB- $ 2.47 billion -RRB-. At the close, the <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times-Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> 100-share index was up 1.2 points, or 0.06 percent, at 2,071.7. The index plunged as much as 13.9 points following the trade report, but then moved to a maximum 3.3 points up in the afternoon. <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> 30-share index finished 2.5 points lower at 1,705.5. The Financial Times 500-share index rose 0.46 point to close at 1,180.90. Volume was light, with 449.8 million shares changing hands, compared with 346.9 million shares on Tuesday. Dealers also attributed the market's recovery from its lows to a lack of selling pressure. `` People are n't prepared to sell. And if there is n't any selling pressure, the market ca n't go down,'' one trader said. Internationally oriented stocks once again were among the major gainers, helped by the dollar's continued strength, despite concerted intervention by major central banks to push the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> currency lower.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 In what would be <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s largest management buyout ever, directors of <ORGANIZATION> Magnet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION> have offered to purchase the maker and retailer of home improvement products for a total of 630.4 million pounds -LRB- $ 1.07 billion -RRB- in cash. The offer values Magnet's ordinary shares at 552.6 million pounds -LRB- $ 939 million -RRB-, or 300 pence -LRB- $ 5.10 -RRB- each. The remainder of the total price is being offered to buy out the existing Magnet convertible stock. Shares in Magnet finished at 309 pence -LRB- $ 6.35 -RRB- on <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, up 20 pence -LRB- 34 cents -RRB-. Meanwhile, Magnet stockholders are being offered new shares that are convertible into stock of the buyout vehicle, known as DMWSL 033 PLC. Conversion of the new stock, which would amount to a 20-percent stake in <LOCATION> DMWSL </LOCATION>, would take place if the company is sold or refloated on the stock market. Magnet Chairman <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Duxbury </PERSON>, who would take over as chairman and chief executive of <LOCATION> DMWSL </LOCATION>, has in recent years steered the company from being a supplier to the building trade to being a retailer. This change of strategic direction, coupled with an uncertain outlook for British consumer spending in coming months, is expected to have an adverse impact on the company's stock price in the short - to medium-term, <LOCATION> Duxbury </LOCATION> said in a statement The cash portion of the buyout offer represents a 47-percent premium over the Magnet share price of 204 pence -LRB- $ 3.47 -RRB- just prior to the January announcement that a management buyout was being considered. Magnet had profit before tax of 57.5 million pounds -LRB- $ 98 million -RRB- on revenue of 375.6 million pounds -LRB- $ 639 million -RRB- in 1988.

 Federal regulators today seized control of 20 subsidiary banks of <ORGANIZATION> MCorp </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>' second largest banking company, and pumped in $ 300 million in government money. The action put all but five <ORGANIZATION> MCorp </ORGANIZATION> subsidiary banks under government ownership. Regulators transferred $ 11.6 billion in deposits of the failed banks to a new, government-owned institution, <ORGANIZATION> Deposit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bridge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dallas </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deposit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which insures commercial bank deposits up to $ 100,000, said the failed banks opened for business today and service to customers would continue uninterrupted. `` As far as the customers are concerned it will be business as usual for all 20 banks,'' said <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Seidman </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Seidman </PERSON> would not estimate how much the government will ultimately have to spend to restore the banks to health, saying he did not want to reveal that figure to investors expected to bid on the banks. However, private analysts have said they expect the failure will cost the <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION>, already depleted by a post-Depression record 221 bank failures last year, $ 1 billion to $ 2 billion. That would make the transaction the third most costly commercial bank rescue, after <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> RepublicBank </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> in 1988 Continental Illinois of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> in 1984. `` We are going to proceed with the sale as promptly as possible,'' <PERSON> Seidman </PERSON> said, but he added that the agency may extend its April 3 deadline for offers. <ORGANIZATION> MCorp </ORGANIZATION>, which has 86 offices, lost $ 903 million last year. It is the last of the large <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> banks to needing to be recapitalized, either through federal rescue or private merger. In a statement today, <ORGANIZATION> MCorp </ORGANIZATION> said the five remaining banks and the trust subsidiary `` form the nucleus of a new beginning for MCorp'' which still intends to file for bankruptcy protection. `` While the nature of of <ORGANIZATION> MCorp </ORGANIZATION> has been altered dramatically, a solid, healthy core remains,'' Chairman <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bishop </PERSON> said. `` We are extremely pleased that this group of five MBanks had the strength and resourcefulness to withstand the incredible pressures of the economic downturn over the past several years.'' Regulators said the 20 insolvent banks had assets of $ 15.4 billion, including assets of $ 6.4 billion at the lead bank in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> and $ 3.2 billion at the next biggest subsidiary in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>. The five remaining insolvent banks have assets of about $ 3 billion. Comptroller of the Currency <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Clarke </PERSON>, the chief regulator of nationally chartered banks, the figure was triggered by demands beginning Monday on the lead bank in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>, both from depositors and from the other banks in the holding company. On Tuesday, `` it became clear as the day wore on that the -LRB- <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> -RRB- bank was not going to be able to meet the demands of depositors,'' <PERSON> Clarke </PERSON> said. Five of the banks were insolvent standing on their own and the remaining 15 failed after the <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> bank could not meet their demands for deposits. The demands of all outside customers were met, he said. Federal action was complicated by the fact that regulators legally could not take control of the five <ORGANIZATION> MCorp </ORGANIZATION> subsidiary banks that remain solvent. The move against the 20 has triggered a battle over assets held by the holding company. Regulators maintain that holding company assests should be used to defer federal costs in rescuing the insolvent subsidiary banks, but <ORGANIZATION> MCorp </ORGANIZATION> has resisted that. `` The <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION> intends to pursue potential claims against <ORGANIZATION> MCorp </ORGANIZATION> for liabilities and obligations of <ORGANIZATION> MCorp </ORGANIZATION> to the 20 subsidiary banks that were closed,'' the agency said in a statement. <PERSON> Seidman </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION> chairman, declined to say how large the claim against the holding company is except to say it is `` substantial'' and `` material.'' Since last year, the insurance fund had been trying to force the holding company to inject $ 400 million into 18 of its banks. For future cases, the <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION> is seeking legislation from <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> that would permit it to force solvent subsidiary banks to back up sister institutions that fail. The <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION>'s move came a week after creditors of <ORGANIZATION> MCorp </ORGANIZATION> forced it to seek protection under Chapter 11 of the Federal Bankruptcy Code. The holding company had halted payments on $ 466 million in debt last October but had asked creditors to refrain from pressing their claims while it attempted to work out an assistance agreement with the <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION>. Reportedly among those interested in buying <ORGANIZATION> MCorp </ORGANIZATION> is <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Abboud </PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bancorporation </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>, which was itself rescued by the <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION> in 1987 with $ 1 billion. Other likely bidders are <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kravis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Roberts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, the <PERSON> Pritzker </PERSON> family of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> and a group led by <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Gray </PERSON>, former chairman of <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technologies </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. The 20 <ORGANIZATION> MCorp </ORGANIZATION> banks seized today were: MBank <LOCATION> Abilene </LOCATION>, MBank <LOCATION> Alamo </LOCATION>, MBank <LOCATION> Austin </LOCATION>, MBank <LOCATION> Brenham </LOCATION>, MBank <LOCATION> Corsicana </LOCATION>, MBank <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>, MBank <LOCATION> Denton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> MBank </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION>, MBank <LOCATION> Greenville </LOCATION>, MBank <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>, <PERSON> MBank </PERSON> <PERSON> Jefferson </PERSON>, MBank <LOCATION> Longview </LOCATION>, <PERSON> MBank </PERSON> <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON>, MBank Midcities, MBank <LOCATION> Odessa </LOCATION>, MBank Orange, MBank Round Rock, <PERSON> MBank </PERSON> <PERSON> Sherman </PERSON>, MBank <LOCATION> Wichita </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Falls </LOCATION> and MBank The Woodlands. The five remaining solvent banks are MBank <LOCATION> Brownsville </LOCATION>, MBank <LOCATION> Corpus </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Christi </LOCATION>, MBank <LOCATION> Waco </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> MBank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Paso </ORGANIZATION> and MBank <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Braunfels </LOCATION>. A six subsidiary, <ORGANIZATION> MTrust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, also remains solvent. All creditors and depositors, even those with accounts higher than the $ 100,000 insurance limit, are fully protected at all of the failed banks, except the subsidiary in <LOCATION> Abilene </LOCATION>. Depositors with more than $ 100,000 in that institution will have to pursue a claim against the bank and may lose a portion of their uninsured funds. The <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION> appointed <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Gardner </PERSON>, chairman of MBank <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>, as president of its new government-owned holding company. It said it will seek a new chairman from outside the MCorp system.

 An aggressive exporter for decades, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> finds itself on the receiving end as Asian neighbors pursuing the Japanese path to success edge into its home market for products ranging from clothes to cassette players. The government is squeezed between domestic demands for protection from foreign exporters and international pressure to buy more abroad to cut <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s mammoth trade surplus. At least one prominent economist, <PERSON> Heizo </PERSON> <PERSON> Takenaka </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Osaka </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, has suggested avoiding the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> pattern of limiting some imports to protect domestic industries. Writing in a recent issue of the Economist magazine, <PERSON> Takenaka </PERSON> said such restraints `` have weakened the competitive power of American industry and damaged the economic well-being of consumers.'' <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> are leading the Asian assault on the Japanese market, capturing the dominant share of textiles. `` Manufactured goods from <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> really began taking off in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> over the last year or two because the yen's rapid appreciation has made them very inexpensive,'' said <PERSON> Naruaki </PERSON> <PERSON> Fujisaki </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Asian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Developing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economies </ORGANIZATION>. `` And we can expect the trend to continue,'' the researcher said, adding that the new competition has forced Japanese manufacturers to set up operations in East and <LOCATION> Southeast </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>, where labor costs are lower. South Korean exports to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> surged by 156 percent in the first nine months of 1988, with textile exports growing 160 percent, machinery 165 percent and steel products 224 percent, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industry </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> expanded exports to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> by 152 percent in 1987, with textile products up 165 percent and machinery 182 percent, ministry figures show. Japanese investment in <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>, meanwhile, soared by almost 110 percent in the fiscal year ended March 1988 to $ 486.8 million compared with the year-earlier period, the <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> External Trade Organization reported in January. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s textile makers, whose losses nearly doubled to $ 7 billion in 1988 from $ 3.4 billion a year earlier, have taken steps to protect themselves. After imports of South Korean knitwear soared by more than 60 percent last year, domestic makers accused the South Koreans of dumping, a customer-grabbing strategy of selling goods at up to 40 percent below the fair home-market price. South Korean sweater makers avoided the first Japanese government investigation for dumping by agreeing in February to limit Japan-bound exports for three years to within 1 percent of the 1988 volume of 63.4 million sweaters. `` We were not only thinking of the knitwear sector,'' said <PERSON> Kagayaki </PERSON> <PERSON> Miyazaki </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Textile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION>. `` The rules that we established will also contribute to steel, cement and other sectors.'' The agreement, however, has raised criticism that <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> is backtracking on its pledge to promote free trade. `` As a country heavily dependent on global markets, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> should normally be expected to be the leader in the battle against protectionism,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Nikkei </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shimbun </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s leading economic newspaper, commented editorially. It called the agreement `` overly protective.'' For years, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> has been the target of charges by trading partners that its manufacturers have been dumpers themselves. Some of the most recent charges involved semiconductor computer chips. To meet foreign demands, the Japanese also have been voluntarily restraining some exports, such as U.S.-bound cars. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> is under pressure from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and other trading partners to reduce its trade surplus by absorbing imports from developing Asian nations that have been relying on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and European markets. Its overall trade surplus totaled $ 77.4 billion in 1988, with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> accounting for $ 47.61 billion, <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> figures show. <PERSON> Kazuaki </PERSON> <PERSON> Hasegawa </PERSON> of the trade ministry's <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Policy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> said the knitwear dispute was a special case, and that <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> is committed to unrestricted trade and importing more from neighbors. `` In <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, the knitwear association consists of small - and medium-size companies and if there's a sudden increase -LRB- in imports -RRB- it's particularly hard on these weak companies,'' he said `` In that case we need countermeasures.'' The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> also has negotiated restraints with such major textile exporters as <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>. Most of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s 8,000 knit makers, who employ 150,000 workers, are smalltime operations in a fading industry. But in such major Japanese sectors as steel, petrochemicals and electronics, Asian neighbors are working to establish a foothold too. Steel imports, almost half from <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, rose from 2.9 million tons in fiscal 1985 to 5 million tons in fiscal 1987. With foreigners holding a 10 percent market share, domestic makers are starting to clamor for a dumping investigation. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s petrochemical industry faces keen competition from the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION> in the near future, a governmental advisory committee warned in a recent report. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> is due to start two large chemical plants in 1989 and others are planned in <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> and other Asian nations. Japanese electronics and appliance makers saw profits climb in 1988 from sales of more sophisticated products such as large-screen televisions and a decline in the popularity of cheap electronic imports from <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> neighbors. But <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> are preparing to follow <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s path into higher technology, raising Japanese industry resistance to sharing technology with these competitors. <ORGANIZATION> Goldstar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, a major South Korean electronics maker, has announced plans to boost the value of electronics exports to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> from $ 250 million in 1988 to $ 400 million this year. Other South Korean electronics exporters also have doubled their targets for exporting competitive products to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. End adv for Sunday, April 2

 <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s most powerful business organization said Wednesday its members will increase direct investment in developing countries to aid those indebted nations. The <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organizations </ORGANIZATION> said it had established two new semigovernmental groups composed of representatives of leading Japanese corporations to promote direct investment in the Third World. `` It's important for us to provide not only money but technology and management'' to help develop industries in such countries, Prime Minister <PERSON> Noboru </PERSON> <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> said at a meeting of the federation. The two new groups, the <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> JAIDO </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- and the <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cooperation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Projects </ORGANIZATION>, are considering investments in some 80 proposed projects, including an industrial park in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>, a copper mine in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and rubber and eucalyptus cultivation in other countries. <ORGANIZATION> JAIDO </ORGANIZATION> will be set up as a joint stock company with capital provided by 98 corporations and the government's Overseas Economic Cooperation Fund. It will use its funds for direct investment in joint ventures. The second group will act as liaison between <ORGANIZATION> JAIDO </ORGANIZATION> and appropriate government bodies. It also will examine <ORGANIZATION> JAIDO </ORGANIZATION>'s proposed investments in light of investment guidelines endorsed by the government and the <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organizations </ORGANIZATION> to ensure the projects are not aimed at promoting Japanese exports Although no projects have been chosen, members of the groups said four or five would begin this year and 10 would be selected in 1990. The projects will be joint ventures with developing countries or international organizations, such as the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industrial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>. Following the example of the Japanese government the federation decided to involve <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s private sector in economic development efforts, members said. `` Private business is willing to take risks in supporting the self-help efforts of others,'' <PERSON> Kazuo </PERSON> <PERSON> Haruna </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Marubeni </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> told reporters after the federation's gathering. In a related development, the government Wednesday approved a $ 478 million loan to <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>, the first loan to be extended by <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> to the heavily-indebted nation in four years. The yen-based government loan will be used for a major irrigation project and harbor improvement at a major port, among other undertakings.

 Grain and soybean futures prices closed little changed Wednesday after a quiet session on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>. Corn and soybean futures finished slightly lower, reflecting disappointment in the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s announcement late Tuesday that the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> had purchased 550,000 metric tons of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> corn. Traders had been expecting a sale of about 2 million metric tons. Losses in the soybean market were limited by indications that the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> had made a substantial purchase of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> soybean meal earlier in the week. Wheat futures ended mostly higher on signs of increased export demand for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> wheat, including interest by <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>, analysts said.

 A group of seven major insurance companies has made a $ 225 million investment in <ORGANIZATION> Goldman </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sachs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, bolstering the capital of the brokerage and investment banking firm, it was announced Wednesday. The companies, which were not named, will be passive investors, meaning they will have no voting rights or role in management, <ORGANIZATION> Goldman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sachs </ORGANIZATION> said. The investment is the second substantial infusion of funds <ORGANIZATION> Goldman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sachs </ORGANIZATION> has received in just over two years. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Sumitomo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION> in late 1986 agreed to purchase a non-voting stake in <ORGANIZATION> Goldman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sachs </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Sumitomo </ORGANIZATION> agreed to invest up to $ 500 million as a limited partner. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Weinberg </PERSON>, senior partner of <ORGANIZATION> Goldman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sachs </ORGANIZATION>, described the latest investment as `` a vote of confidence in the future of our firm and our leadership in the securities industry.'' `` It strengthens our substantial capital base, which enables us to maintain our position as a leading globabl investment banking firm and to support our clients' market objectives,'' <PERSON> Weinberg </PERSON> said in a prepared statement. With the addition of the $ 225 million fixed-return equity investment, <ORGANIZATION> Goldman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sachs </ORGANIZATION>' partnership capital will be raised to $ 2.1 billion, a company spokesman said. In a move related to the investment, <ORGANIZATION> Goldman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sachs </ORGANIZATION> has formed a new limited partnership which will be the holding entity for the investment banking and brokerage company.

<HEAD>Analysts Say Significant Hurdles Stand In Way Of Northwest Suitors</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Real estate holdings in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> and other valuable assets of <ORGANIZATION> NWA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> make the parent of <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> an attractive takeover target, but analysts on Wednesday said significant hurdles could ground a possible buyout bid. <ORGANIZATION> NWA </ORGANIZATION> stock activity remained heavy Wednesday in the wake of Tuesday's announcement that an investment group is interested in a possible acquisition, but the price was down $ 2.50 a share to $ 67.87 -LCB- in late afternoon trading. Northwest has not identified the investment group, which it said holds a 4.9 percent chunk of the airline's 29.1 million shares. The group recently notified the Eagan-based company of its interest in exploring `` a negotiated leveraged acquisition,'' Northwest disclosed. However, no tender offer has been made to shareholders and the company wo n't say whether the investment group has made a formal purchase offer to the board of directors. <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> vowed Tuesday to remain independent. <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Marckesano </PERSON>, an airline analyst at <ORGANIZATION> Janney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Montgomery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Scott </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, said he issued a `` buy'' recommendation Wednesday morning for <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> stock because of the takeover speculation and because balance sheet fundamentals suggest the stock could reach the $ 80 range by the end of this year without a takeover. `` It's still below what the stock should be trading at,'' <PERSON> Marckesano </PERSON> said. The airline company has become a takeover target because it is a perennial money maker with assets that could be sold for much more than their book value, he said. Northwest, described by <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> as the nation's fourth largest airline in revenue passenger miles, reported a record profit for 1988 of $ 135.1 million, up 31 percent from 1987. `` There are assets to be sold and they could certainly stand a lot more debt than they have,'' <PERSON> Marckesano </PERSON> said. `` Someone who wanted to take it over in the $ 90 to $ 100 -LRB- a share -RRB- range _ that's perfectly feasible. A buyer could quickly sell <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION>'s land holdings in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, for example, and use the profits to repay debt incurred in the acquisition of the airline, <PERSON> Marckesano </PERSON> said. Late last year a Japanese group offered to pay $ 350 million for part of the downtown property. The entire holdings could fetch as much as $ 500 million, analysts have said. <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> routes, the envy of the industry, also could be sold to repay acquisition debts. <PERSON> Marckesano </PERSON> said a new owner also could raise money by selling some equipment and then leasing it. He said he is n't concerned about a `` poison pill'' defense adopted Monday by <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION>'s board of directors because he said it merely protects against someone `` stealing'' the company. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Decker </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Chicago-based </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Duff </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Phelps </PERSON> agreed that the `` poison pill'' wo n't stand in the way of a legitimate offer. But he said a sound leveraged buyout proposal is unlikely. `` The scenario I can see is someone coming in and buying the airline and running it like it is,'' <PERSON> Decker </PERSON> said. `` To make that doable, it ca n't involve a lot of debt so it ca n't be a leveraged buyout. Then you're down to a very few potential buyers for it.'' In a leveraged buyout, the buyers typically borrow heavily against the cash flow or the assets of the target to make the deal. Too much debt would cripple <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> because the airline will need all the cash it can muster in coming years to buy new jets, <PERSON> Decker </PERSON> said. The average aircraft in the company's 312-jet fleet is 14.4 years old compared with the industry average of 11.7 years, he said. <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Daugherty </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Dean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Witter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reynolds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> said the burdensome debts of a leveraged buyout would also make the company especially vulnerable in an economic downturn. `` The idea of cutting back on capital spending and letting excess cash flow pay down the debt _ I do n't think you could really get away with that,'' <PERSON> Daugherty </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Daugherty </PERSON> and <PERSON> Decker </PERSON> also said the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> could pose a problem for suitors interested in a breakup of the airline. The proposed sale of routes, airport gates or other transportation operations at <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> would be subject to antitrust investigations, limiting the number of potential buyers, they said. `` The industry is more concentrated today. There are fewer players,'' said <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rule </PERSON>, assistant attorney general in charge of the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s antitrust division. `` For that reason one can say that a proposed further concentration is likely to attract a good deal of <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> scrutiny.'' Yet another potential problem could rise from labor ranks at <LOCATION> Northwest </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Guy </PERSON> <PERSON> Cook </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lodge </ORGANIZATION> 143, which represents nearly two-thirds of <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION>'s 35,000 employees, said Wednesday that workers would go as far as staging an illegal strike to prevent the sale of <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> to a hostile buyer. `` Our message to any potential buyer is very clear,'' <PERSON> Cook </PERSON> said. `` If there is an indication on their part there will be a breakup, there's going to be all out war on this airline.''

<HEAD>Ford Announces 2.9 Percent Financing, Rebates</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FREDERICK STANDISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, smarting from lower-than-expected early 1989 sales, said Wednesday it would offer cash rebates of up to $ 4,000 and new-car financing as low as 2.9 percent. There was no immediate indication that rivals <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> would match the move by <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>, which also said it was scaling back its full-year projections for industrywide car and light truck sales. <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> currently offer cash rebates of up to $ 2,000 and financing as low as 4.9 percent on a variety of cars and trucks. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> _ which had been offering similar incentives _ cited rising interest rates that have sapped consumer demand and slowed sales as prompting its stepped-up program. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Rewey </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>'s North American sales vice president, said vehicle sales during the first 80 days of 1989 fell below expectations and <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> was lowering its prediction for industrywide car and light truck sales to about 15 million from the previous 15.4 million. `` People still want to buy cars and trucks, -LRB- but -RRB- there may be some hesitation,'' <PERSON> Rewey </PERSON> said. Part of that hesitation stemmed from the recent rise in interest rates set by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> and banks. Banks have boosted their prime lending rate _ used as a benchmark on a range of consumer and business loans _ to 11.5 percent from 10.5 percent at the first of the year. The banks have boosted their rates in response to interest rate pressure by the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>, which is attempting to curb inflation by tightening credit. Rising rates have ratcheted up house payments for people with adjustable-rate mortgages, causing a slowing in consumer spending for durable goods such as cars and trucks, <PERSON> Rewey </PERSON> said. `` There has to be concern of the very rampant move of interest rates in the first quarter'' of this year, he said. `` We believe the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> actions have generated what they wanted to generate,'' he said. Vehicle sales between Jan. 1 and March 20 this year by the eight companies making cars in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> were 5.4 percent behind last year's pace. Automobile sales were off 8.2 percent and truck sales were 0.3 percent lower than in the year-earlier period. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> sales during the first 80 days of the year have been running at an annual rate of about 14.6 million vehicles, <PERSON> Rewey </PERSON> said. Typically, March and April are big buying months as <LOCATION> Americans </LOCATION> prepare for the summertime driving season. Automakers and analysts have said since late last year they expected sales to decline from 1988, the second-best ever. But there has been concern on Wall Street that recent sales figures were lower than anticipated. `` It's not surprising given that the 20-day -LRB- sales -RRB- numbers for March do not look good,'' said analyst <PERSON> Jeannette </PERSON> <PERSON> Garretty </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. `` This first quarter is showing up very weak.'' Incentives cut directly into profits and analysts are reviewing <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>'s earnings picture. `` My guess is that it may prevent <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>'s first-quarter earnings from being higher than last year's,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Healy </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` They could be down about 10 percent.'' But <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Phillippi </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, said <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>'s financial strength overseas would cancel out lower profits in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. `` There are offsets to the costs of these incentive programs,'' he said. `` So we may not see a significant reduction in earnings in the first quarter. I'm not going to change my numbers.'' Wall Street also has been concerned that the industry's vehicle inventories have been running higher than anticipated. <PERSON> Ward </PERSON>'s Automotive Reports, a weekly industry publication, said that by the end of February there was an 78-day supply of cars on dealer lots <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>'s car inventory stood at 82 days on March 20 and truck inventory was 76 days, <PERSON> Rewey </PERSON> said, virtually the same since the first of the year.

<HEAD>Gasoline, Crude Oil Rise; Nearby Heating Oil Off</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Gasoline and crude oil futures prices spurted ahead Wednesday while wholesale home heating oil slid back slightly. The contract for May delivery of West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark grade of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> crude, recovered nearly half of the amount lost in Tuesday's selloff. On the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, the May WTI contract ended the session at $ 20.20 a barrel, up 29 cents from Tuesday's settlement On Tuesday, the May crude oil contract shed 62 cents from Monday's closing level. Prices were bid up in the energy pits Monday as traders weighed the implications of an oil spill off the <LOCATION> Alaskan </LOCATION> port of <LOCATION> Valdez </LOCATION>, which caused the temporary closure of the port, reducing <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> crude supplies for a time. Among refined petroleum products traded on the exchange, unleaded gasoline for April delivery rose 1.50 cents, settling at 60.18 cents a gallon. The April heating oil contract finished off 0.42 cent, at 54.62 cents a gallon, but contracts for May, June and July delivery all posted gains. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connell </PERSON>, a senior energy analyst at <ORGANIZATION> Refco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, said energy futures weakened in the early going Wednesday and then gained fresh upward momentum, mainly because of buying in the gasoline pits. `` Everybody's in love with gasoline,'' said <PERSON> O'Connell </PERSON>. Traders have been buying gasoline in recent weeks amid speculation that supplies could be tight this summer in the <LOCATION> Northeast </LOCATION> if refiners in the region are required to alter their methods. Gasoline refining changes which would cut pollution-causing emissions have been proposed in a plan aimed at reducing smog in the Northeastern states. <PERSON> O'Connell </PERSON> said some of the gasoline buying Wednesday may have been caused by a change in the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>'s contract specifications The exchange made the change to comply with recently altered industry practices. Meanwhile, crude oil buying may have been spurred by indications that the <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> countries are in no hurry to establish higher crude production levels. An <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> monitoring committee met Wednesday in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION> to formally review the cartel's price-boosting strategy. <PERSON> Subroto </PERSON>, secretary-general of the 13-nation <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exporting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Countries </ORGANIZATION>, said the eight panel members discussed a range of topics in the four-hour, closed-door meeting but he refused to elaborate. `` The function of the committee is to review prices and to review -LRB- production -RRB- quotas,'' he said. `` ... We are not going to make any decision.''

 A <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> company can pursue its $ 970 million bid for <ORGANIZATION> Prime </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Computer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> once details of investment banker <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>'s financial role are disclosed, a federal appeals court ruled Wednesday. The 1st U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> upheld a lower court ruling blocking the takeover bid by <ORGANIZATION> MAI </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Basic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Four </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> on grounds that <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION>'s role in the deal made it a co-bidder. But the appeals court said an injunction against the bid issued in December would be lifted after <LOCATION> Tustin </LOCATION>, Calif.-based MAI Basic makes specific disclosures to the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. The decision requires MAI Basic to provide <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> financial statements, records of recent stock trading activity and identification of all Drexel-affiliated officers and directors. MAI Basic President <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Patton </PERSON> said the company would work with <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> to comply with the court guidelines and disclose all pertinent documents. MAI Basic has offered $ 20 a share for Natick-based Prime, which is four times the size of its suitor. But <PERSON> Patton </PERSON> said legal infighting could prove moot after Prime shareholders hold their annual meeting May 12. `` The whole thing is going to come down to a proxy fight anyway,'' he said. `` We've applied to the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> for approval and we're expecting it any day. After that, the court actions become nothing more than legal jostling.'' Prime spokesman <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Gavaghan </PERSON> said the appeals court ruling affirmed the company's position that stockholders need additional information before deciding on the takeover. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Mazzone </PERSON> last month continued his order blocking MAI's bid while asking for additional information about how <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> would finance the deal. In January, <PERSON> MAI </PERSON> <PERSON> Basic </PERSON> said the Wall Street firm was confident it could raise $ 875 million to finance the takeover despite its guilty plea in a massive securities fraud settlement.

<HEAD>Sugar Futures Rebound On Rumored Cuban Shortfall</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 Sugar futures prices bounced back from recent lows in active trading Wednesday on indications that <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> was renegotiating some of its deliveries to trade houses so that it could meet its commitments to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. On other markets, most energy futures advanced; gold and silver futures retreated; grains and soybeans were mixed; and livestock and meat futures were mixed. Sugar settled .50 cent to .89 cent higher on <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s Coffee, <ORGANIZATION> Sugar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Cocoa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> with the contract for delivery in May at 12.20 cents a pound. The rally erased nearly all the losses that had followed last week's statements by the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> that it had bought all the sugar it needed for this year. Analysts noted some signs Wednesday that <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> may be planning further sugar purchases despite its statements to the contrary. But the main impetus for the runup was heavy buying by the French trade house Sucres et Denrees, which was believed to be scrambling for supplies because it had agreed to return to <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> 150,000 metric tons of sugar for redelivery to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. `` The possible cause is that <LOCATION> Russia </LOCATION> put pressure on -LRB- <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> -RRB- and they had to fulfill their commitment to <LOCATION> Russia </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Dunlaevy </PERSON>, a sugar trader with <ORGANIZATION> Balfour </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Maclaine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> might have said to the trade house something like, ` We owe you sugar. Can we have it back and repay you in 1990?''' <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>, the world's fourth-largest sugar producer, has overcommitted itself on sugar sales for the past two or three years, analysts said. `` They are committed to ship 4.2 million tons to the Soviets this year and they have to say, ` What commitment do we meet, that commitment or our commitment to the trade houses?''' said analyst <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Badenhop </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Capital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Markets </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` This indicates they are going to try to meet their commitments to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>,'' he said. Crude oil futures rose moderately on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> after a day of volatile activity linked to concerns about the Exxon Valdez oil spill in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> and an <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> monitoring committee meeting in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>. Heating oil futures finished mixed but gasoline prices rose sharply in reaction to an <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> report showing a larger-than-expected drawdown in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> gasoline stocks last week. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Intermediate crude settled 26 cents to 37 cents higher with May at $ 20.20 a barrel; heating oil was .42 cent lower to .44 cent higher with April at 54.62 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was .65 cent to 1.59 cent higher with April at 60.18 cents a gallon. Gold futures fell slightly while silver posted steeper losses on <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> as inflation fears continued to ease following the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s report of a 0.3 percent decline in the Index of Leading Economic Indicators. Gold settled unchanged to $ 1.30 lower with April at $ 383.50 a troy ounce; silver was 3.6 cents to 5.8 cents lower with May at $ 5.808 a troy ounce. Grain and soybean futures finished little changed in a quiet session on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>. Trading activity has slowed ahead of Friday's <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> quarterly grain stocks report and annual spring planting estimate. Wheat settled -LCB- cent lower to 1 cent higher with May at $ 4.28 \ a bushel; corn was -LCB- cent to 2 cents lower with May at $ 2.73 \ a bushel; oats were 1 cent lower to \ cent higher with May at $ 1.97 a bushel; soybeans were 1 -RCB- cents to 5 cents lower with May at $ 7.61 a Reports of stronger spot markets boosted live cattle futures on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>; trading in pork futures was cautious ahead of Friday's quarterly <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> hogs and pigs report. Live cattle settled .10 cent to .75 cent higher with April at 78.52 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .20 cent lower to .25 cent higher with April at 81.70 cents a pound; hogs were .45 cent lower to .08 cent higher with April at 41.67 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were .12 cent lower to .35 cent higher with May at 38.37 cents a pound.

 The dollar lost some ground in choppy domestic trading Wednesday after rising in foreign exchange trading overseas. Gold prices were mostly lower. <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> quoted a bid of $ 381.80 for a troy ounce of gold at 4 p.m. EST, compared with $ 383.00 late Tuesday. The dollar closed higher in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and remained relatively strong when dealing shifted to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Traders noted that activity had slowed to a trickle in the afternoon and that buying was mostly speculative in nature. `` The dollar has made a key surge to the upside and is now beginning to stabilize,'' said <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Barbanel </PERSON>, a senior vice president at <ORGANIZATION> Gruntal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Co.. Traders believe that there is still room for interest rates to move higher, despite a spate of recent government statistics showing the economy may be cooling down Higher interest rates support the dollar by making dollar-denominated securities more attractive. The major central banks, with the exception of the influential <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION>, tried to depress the dollar by selling the currency, but analysts noted that their effort was restrained. While the central banks want to make their presence known, `` one gets the impression that they are not willing to really turn the market around at this stage,'' said <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Leach </PERSON>, a currency analyst at <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>. Feeding that sentiment were comments by <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Boskin </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advisers </ORGANIZATION>, who indicated the dollar remains at competitive levels for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> manufacturers despite its rise this week to seven-month highs. Also underlying the bullish mood is anticipation of hefty dollar buying from <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, where the fiscal year is about to end and where a plethora of 10-year bonds are coming due, thereby freeing up a substantial amount of cash that could be invested in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> securities. There is some fear, however, that `` if the market keeps pushing the dollar higher, the central banks may respond more aggressively,'' <PERSON> Leach </PERSON> said. Traders said there was little reaction to a <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> report showing the government's chief economic forecasting gauge dropped 0.3 percent in February after gaining sharply in the previous two months. The decline had been expected. In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, the dollar closed at 133.25 Japanese yen, up from 132.30. Later in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, it traded at 132.73 yen. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, the dollar rose to 133.12 yen, from 133.10 yen Tuesday. The British pound fell after government figures showed British imports continued to grow faster than exports. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s current account deficit totaled $ 2.88 billion in February, higher than the $ 2.47 billion deficit analysts had forecast. The pound has lost nearly 9.5 cents against the dollar since mid-February. One British pound cost $ 1.6870 in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> late Wednesday, cheaper for buyers than Tuesday's $ 1.7030. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> it cost $ 1.6875 to buy one pound, more expensive than Wednesday's $ 1.6855 Other late dollar rates in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, compared with late Tuesday, included: 1.8935 West German marks, down from 1.8953; 1.6513 Swiss francs, down from 1.6533; 6.3905 French francs, down from 6.4010; 1,389.00 Italian lire, up from 1,379.50, and 1.1942 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1952. Other late dollar rates in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, compared with late rates Tuesday, included: 1.8910 West German marks, up from 1.8850; 1.6490 Swiss francs, up from 1.6415; 6.3800 French francs, up from 6.3625; 2.1315 Dutch guilders, up from 2.1215; 1,385.65 Italian lire, up from 1,379.50, and 1.1935 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1925. Gold prices were mostly lower. But on the Commodity Exchange in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, gold bullion for current delivery closed at $ 383.30 a troy ounce, up from $ 383 on Tuesday. Gold closed in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> at a bid price of $ 382.75 a troy ounce, down from $ 387.50. The closing bid price in <LOCATION> Zurich </LOCATION> was $ 381.75, down from $ 388.00. Earlier in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, gold closed at $ 383.55 an ounce, down from $ 391.35. Silver also fell. On <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s Comex, silver bullion for current delivery finished at $ 5.758 a troy ounce, down from Tuesday's settlement of $ 5.794. Earlier in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, silver traded at a bid $ 5.78 a troy ounce, down from $ 5.91.

 Stock prices notched a third consecutive gain Wednesday in light trading with the help of a late rally in the bond market. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 5.98 to 2,281.52, bringing its gain so far this week to more than 37 points. `` I've not seen too many markets where there's been less enthusiasm about it than in the last three days of this rally,'' said <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, a trader at <PERSON> Alex </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Brown </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sons </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION>. Advancing issues slightly outnumbered declining ones in nationwide trading of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> Exchange-listed stocks, with 741 up, 658 down and 561 unchanged. Volume on the floor of the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> came to 144.24 million shares, down from 146.42 million in the previous session. Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter market, totaled 170.94 million shares. The Dow Jones industrial average was down most of the afternoon but rose in tandem with a rally in the bond market as program buying kicked in. The <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION>'s long bond, up just 1-32 point around midday, finished the day with a gain of 19-32 point, or nearly $ 6 per $ 1,000 in face value. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said its index of leading indicators fell 0.3 percent in February, but the figure fell in line with expectations and had little impact on the stock market. Trading remained fairly light, although not as light as Monday, when a slow comeback from the Easter holiday led to the slowest day of 1989. Slightly less than 113 million shares were traded on the exchange floor that day. Investors remained cautious in spite of the week's recovery, traders said. `` Every time it seems like a little stability comes back into it, something goes way out of whack,'' said <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> Hill </PERSON>, a trader at <ORGANIZATION> Eppler </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guerin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Turner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>.

The <ORGANIZATION> Philadelphia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inquirer </ORGANIZATION> said the company held merger talks last year with <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Beecham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>.

The company started a new buyer-incentive program including low-interest financing and cash rebates. That hurt other auto stocks as well: <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> fell 1 to 415 and <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> dropped -RRB- to 24 -LCB-. <ORGANIZATION> Burlington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> rose 2 -LRB- to 46 \ amid speculation that the company had decided to sell or to sell or spin off its forest-products division The company denied the rumor.

 <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, seeking to lure passengers scared off by a four-week strike, has expanded an on-time guarantee for Northeast travelers and offered a $ 25 gift check for all passengers on the <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> shuttle and on 14 non-stop flights between <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>. The airline announced Wednesday that, beginning April 3, all travelers flying <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> between <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> will have the price of their tickets refunded if their flight departs more than five minutes late. The passengers will receive a $ 25 <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> check just for flying Eastern on those routes. Both the on-time and <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> offers on the shuttle and non-stop flights between <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> will be good until April 30, the airline said. The carrier also discounted the non-stop Boston-Washington flights for weekend travelers. Eastern was extending a shuttle on-time guarantee that started March 20 and would have expired March 31, and expanding that guarantee to the non-stop Boston-Washington flights. Cash or a charge-card credit will be offered to any passenger who qualifies for the refund. Or the customer can choose to receive a free one-way ticket on the same route for future travel. The incentives are a direct response to disappointing passenger loads on the shuttle and union activity designed to keep passengers off the once-proud commuter line Eastern runs between <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>. Eastern spokesman <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Ashlock </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s passenger loads have been running less than half of the pre-strike levels on many of the 120-passenger DC-9 planes that make the 60 to 62 shutttle flights each day. Less than 10 percent of the flights use <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 727s with a capacity of 177 passengers. <PERSON> Ashlock </PERSON> conceded that union strategies to keep people away from <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> have had an effect. He said picket activity by the <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> and pilots in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> has contributed to the reluctance of passengers to fly the shuttle. <PERSON> Ashlock </PERSON> said passenger loads on the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Juan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>, and Latin American flights have been stronger, but the incentives are needed to bolster the shuttle, which accounts for more than half of the carrier's approximate 105 to 110 flights each day. The airline also said it is offering a special $ 98 weekend round-trip discount fare on <LOCATION> Boston-Washington </LOCATION> flights during the month of April. Previously, the fare ranged from $ 238 to $ 368 depending on how early the ticket is bought. Passengers must complete both flight segments between Saturday and Sunday of the same weekend. The carrier offers 14 round trips daily between the two cities.

<HEAD>Real Estate Loans Could Not Isolate MCorp From Trouble, Analysts

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>' energy-wrecked economy doomed <ORGANIZATION> MCorp </ORGANIZATION> despite the bank holding company's focus on real estate instead of energy loans, analysts said Wednesday after regulators seized control of most of the bank holding company. `` Once <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> real estate markets began to slip, there really was very little they could do,'' said banking analyst <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Starr </PERSON> at <ORGANIZATION> Duff </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Phelps </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. `` What you're seeing in the real estate market is simply what started a decade ago in energy problems. ... MCorp is at the tail-end of feeling those problems.'' Twenty of <ORGANIZATION> MCorp </ORGANIZATION>'s 25 banks, including the two largest in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>, were declared insolvent late Tuesday and early Wednesday, and the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deposit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> took over management under a newly chartered, federally owned <ORGANIZATION> Deposit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bridge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> NA </ORGANIZATION> while regulators look for a buyer for some or all of the banks. The <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION> pumped $ 300 million into the banks, but officials would not say how much government aid ultimately will be required. Analysts have said the price tag could run between $ 1 billion and $ 2 billion. While it was the soft real estate market _ <ORGANIZATION> MCorp </ORGANIZATION>'s own 60-story tower in downtown <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> is only about 60 percent rented _ that undercut the bank, a move late last week began the final tumble. S.N. <ORGANIZATION> Phelps </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, a Connecticutt bond-trading firm, and two of its employees, sought to force <ORGANIZATION> MCorp </ORGANIZATION> into bankruptcy because it had not made payments on a little more than $ 2 million in bonds they held. <ORGANIZATION> MCorp </ORGANIZATION> had suspended payment last October on about $ 470 million in bonds and preferred stock. <ORGANIZATION> MCorp </ORGANIZATION> on Monday said it would seek protection instead from creditors under Chapter 11 of the bankruptcy code. The resulting uncertainty apparently set off a run on deposits. Federal regulators, speaking on condition of anonymity, said between $ 50 million and $ 100 million was withdrawn Tuesday from MBank <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>, the firm's lead institution. The withdrawals came both from individual depositors and some of <ORGANIZATION> MCorp </ORGANIZATION>'s other subsidiary banks, the regulators said. The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dallas </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday the <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION> told the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency it would no longer provide open assistance to <ORGANIZATION> MCorp </ORGANIZATION>. `` The <ORGANIZATION> OCC </ORGANIZATION> then advised the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dallas </ORGANIZATION> that under these circumstances, they did not consider <ORGANIZATION> MCorp </ORGANIZATION> a viable financial institution,'' according to a statement from the <ORGANIZATION> Dallas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>. `` Therefore, Tuesday, March 28, 1989, the <ORGANIZATION> Dallas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> called <ORGANIZATION> MCorp </ORGANIZATION>'s loan.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Dallas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> would not reveal the size of <ORGANIZATION> MCorp </ORGANIZATION>'s loan, but figures from the central bank's statement of condition indicate that loans from the <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> branch have gone from $ 778 million on Jan. 26 to $ 1.23 billion on March 23. <ORGANIZATION> MCorp </ORGANIZATION> is the latest large bank rescue in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, although other institutions _ notably <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bancshares </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bancshares </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION> _ have asked for federal assistance and word could come at any time on the resolution of those problems. Earlier this decade, the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> economy was booming on projections of $ 50-per-barrel oil and that optimism spread to developers who rushed to put up project after project, some on flimsy or non-existent demand, according to experts. A recent survey of real estate owners and developers found 89 percent who `` strongly agreed'' or `` somewhat agreed'' that the <LOCATION> Dallas-Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION> market is overbuilt. In its third-quarter report to stockholders, <ORGANIZATION> MCorp </ORGANIZATION> said, `` Asset quality problems, largely releated to loans secured by real estate and assets acquired upon foreclosure, adversely affected the company's financial performance.'' The bank reported a third-quarter loss of $ 517 million, and the <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION> says <ORGANIZATION> MCorp </ORGANIZATION>'s 25 banks lost $ 213 million in the fourth quarter and $ 903 million for the entire year. <ORGANIZATION> MCorp </ORGANIZATION> has yet to release full financial results for the quarter and year. `` The straightforward, honest answer is that the state of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> was hit by an economic H-bomb that had effects on real estate portfolios, energy portfolios, international portfolios and domestic portfolios,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rieke </PERSON>, a banking analyst with the <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> firm of <ORGANIZATION> Rauscher </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pierce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Refsnes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` To its tribute, <ORGANIZATION> MCorp </ORGANIZATION> has been able to withstand the fallout longer than anybody else,'' said <PERSON> Rieke </PERSON>, once a vice-president and treasurer at <ORGANIZATION> MCorp </ORGANIZATION>. Oil prices dropped rather than rose in the mid-1980s and the impact hit <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> first and later the <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> economy. <ORGANIZATION> Duff </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Phelps </ORGANIZATION>' <PERSON> Starr </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> MCorp </ORGANIZATION> probably was guilty of some `` overaggressive lending,'' but not to the extent of some other <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> banks, and most of its loans were to largely reputable developers. <ORGANIZATION> MCorp </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> Bishop </PERSON>, who had attempted to put together a private recapitalization plan, said Wednesday the five banks left `` form the nucleus of a new beginning for MCorp.'' But neither <PERSON> Rieke </PERSON> nor <PERSON> Starr </PERSON> expect that effort to be successful.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monetary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION> announced on Wednesday a loan of $ 442 million to <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>, where riots linked to its debt situation killed at least 300 people last month. <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION> owes about $ 32 billion but this is its first borrowing from the fund. The fund has 151 member countries, including <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>. The loan is repayable in five years with interest at 7.38 percent, considerably less than current rates for bank loans. The fund's announcement said that <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION> is expected to make additional requests for its loans, and to seek credit from other international bodies and commercial banks. This loan can be disbursed immediately. It will enable <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION> to repay a short-term $ 450 million loan from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, announced March 10, soon after the riots. Later credits from the fund would be disbursed periodically subject to `` performance criteria'' such as reductions in Venezuelan government spending. The new government of President <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Andres </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> made policy changes last month similar to those the fund prescribes for countries seeking help with their debts. They included lowering subsidies on food and gasoline. Prices of food and bus fares rose. Protests in <LOCATION> Caracas </LOCATION> turned into riots just as ministers from the <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> government were in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> to sign the `` letter of intent'' needed to get the fund's support.

In its suit, <ORGANIZATION> Rorer </ORGANIZATION> contends `` sweeping,'' unsubstantiated statements by <ORGANIZATION> Pepto-Bismol </ORGANIZATION>'s maker, <ORGANIZATION> Procter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gamble </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, have hurt the sales and reputation of Maalox, Rorer's 40-year-old antacid. Rorer officials declined to estimate how much money they have lost in sales, but the suit calls the sum `` substantial.'' <PERSON> Teri </PERSON> <PERSON> Glover </PERSON>, a spokeswoman at <ORGANIZATION> Procter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Gamble </ORGANIZATION>'s headquarters in <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION>, said the company had not seen the court papers and could not comment. <ORGANIZATION> Procter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Gamble </ORGANIZATION> acquired 88-year-old Pepto-Bismol in 1982 when it bought <ORGANIZATION> Norwich </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eaton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pharmaceuticals </ORGANIZATION>, which also is named as a defendant in the suit. Rorer's suit also alleges that a new Maximum Strength Pepto-Bismol is being sold with a higher dosage than approved by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>. In addition, <ORGANIZATION> Rorer </ORGANIZATION> said, it is disturbed that <ORGANIZATION> Procter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Gamble </ORGANIZATION> contends Pepto-Bismol treats a host of ailments, including heartburn, indigestion, nausea and upset stomach. Rorer contends Pepto-Bismol is effective against only heartburn, fullness and nausea caused specifically by overindulgence in food and alcohol. `` The <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> has specifically found that Pepto-Bismol is not effective for most of the claims for which it is promoted,'' said the suit, filed Thursday. <PERSON> Brad </PERSON> <PERSON> Stone </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, said the agency had no comment on the suit. The Maalox line of over-the-counter antacids is the best-selling antacid in the nation and the world. It had <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> sales exceeding $ 105 million last year, giving it about 15 percent of the market for antacids, said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Driansky </PERSON>, a vice president and chief counsel for <ORGANIZATION> Rorer </ORGANIZATION>, a division of <ORGANIZATION> Rorer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>.

 <ORGANIZATION> Hewlett-Packard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday it will begin selling leading models of its computer workstations through the nation's two largest industrial distributors, a move reflecting the falling prices of the machines throughout the industry. The company said it has signed distribution agreements with <ORGANIZATION> Schweber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electronics </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Hall-Mark </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electronics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> to sell some models of its HP 9000 Series 300, which adheres to <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T's Unix System V Interface Definition Issue 2. <ORGANIZATION> Digital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Equipment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> has been offering its mid-sized workstations through industrial distributors for some time, and <ORGANIZATION> Hewlett-Packard </ORGANIZATION>'s strategy represents an industry trend needed because prices of the computers have become dramatically cheaper in recent years, said technology analyst <PERSON> Adam </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuhney </PERSON> at <ORGANIZATION> Kidder </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peabody </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> `` It is simply not very appropriate any longer because of how affordable these machines have become to devote the resources of a direct sales force to selling them,'' <PERSON> Cuhney </PERSON> added. New York-based <PERSON> Schweber </PERSON>, part of the <ORGANIZATION> LEX </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electronics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Company </ORGANIZATION>, has 39 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> locations and 408 sales representatives. Hall-Mark, based in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>, has 35 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> locations and 170 sales representatives. `` Entry-level workstations have dropped to less than $ 5,000, so many small - and medium-sized companies now can afford workstations for engineering, design and commercial applications,'' said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Watts </PERSON>, director of marketing for <ORGANIZATION> HP </ORGANIZATION>'s computer products division <PERSON> Watts </PERSON> said the distribution agreements will allow <ORGANIZATION> HP </ORGANIZATION>'s direct sales force to concentrate on Fortune 1000 companies. The worldwide market for general purpose and technical workstations _ high-powered desktop computers that range in cost up to $ 80,000 _ is estimated at $ 4 billion and growing rapidly. Such machines give desktop users vastly improved abilities over standard personal computers, particularly in visual displays, speed and mathematical calculations. HP has been selling workstations in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> through industrial distributors for the last 18 months.

 The leader of <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>' largest union said Wednesday he would vigorously resist if someone succeeds in buying the airline with the intent of breaking it up. `` Our message to any potential buyer is very clear,'' said <PERSON> Guy </PERSON> <PERSON> Cook </PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lodge </ORGANIZATION> 143. `` If there is an indication on their part there will be a breakup, there's going to be all-out war on this airline.'' <PERSON> Cook </PERSON> said management at <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> would not disclose to him the identity of the investment group that the company says is interested in acquiring the airline. Northwest parent <ORGANIZATION> NWA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday said the investment group holds 4.9 percent of the company's 29.1 million shares and has shown an interest in a `` negotiated leveraged acquisition.'' The airline, which has vowed to remain independent, would n't say whether the group has made a formal purchase proposal and the group has not made its intentions public. <PERSON> Cook </PERSON>, whose union represents nearly two-thirds of <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION>'s 35,000 employees, said he suspects the investment group would have to borrow a lot of money to buy Northwest To repay debts of the leveraged buyout, the new owners would probably sell some of the company's assets and eliminate some jobs, he said. If a hostile takeover artist threatens to break up the airline, <PERSON> Cook </PERSON> said the unions would consider their own takeover of Northwest. He said the unions could possibly outbid a hostile suitor by agreeing to contract concessions as part of their own leveraged buyout. A spokewoman for Teamsters Local 2747, which represents about 7,000 <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> flight attendants, said the union would not comment on the situation. Officials at the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Line </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pilots </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, which represents about 5,000 Northwest pilots, did not return phone calls Wednesday.

 Four companies' plans to offer shareholders a chance to exchange up to $ 5.6 billion in stock for new financial instruments called unbundled stock units have come unraveled. <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Pfizer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> joined <PERSON> Sara </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> in saying Wednesday they would n't proceed with plans to offer to exchange up to 20 percent of their common stock for the unbundled units, called USUs. In trading on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, the prices of all four companies' stocks rose. <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> rose 25 cents a share to $ 31.12 -LCB-, <ORGANIZATION> Pfizer </ORGANIZATION> rose 62 -LCB- cents a share to $ 57.12 -LCB-, <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION> was up $ 1.25 a share at $ 90.87 -LCB- and <PERSON> Sara </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> was up 62 -LCB- cents a share at $ 48. The company decisions came a day after their underwriter and the inventor of the new securities, <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, advised them that the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> staff objected to an accounting treatment that <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> said was an important motivation for making the exchange. <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> said the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> staff believed the new securities should be counted among total shares outstanding in determining a company's earnings per share. That ruling would frustrate a key motivation for a company to offer the exchange _ reducing the amount of its common stock outstanding and thereby boosting earnings per share. <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> said it therefore would recommend that the four companies withdraw the planned offering of USUs and all four agreed. Under <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION>'s plan, each <ORGANIZATION> USU </ORGANIZATION> would consist of a 30-year bond, a preferred stock share and a stock appreciation certificate. The three components could be traded separately, in combinations or as a unit. <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> said the exchange would give companies a way to reduce the amount of stock they have outstanding without taking on a big debt load as would be required with normal stock buybacks or restructuring. The firm felt it could also help boost stock prices by calling attention to the reasons people buy stock _ the dividend, the chance that the dividend will be raised and the hope that the stock price will rise _ and by possibly helping to actually lift its stock price. `` While we believe this innovative plan would have created excellent value for our stockholders, we will aggressively pursue other attractive financial concepts that offer us opportunities to create shareholder wealth,'' <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, <PERSON> Sara </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>'s chairman and chief executive, said in a statement released late Tuesday. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, chief financial officer for <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION>, said, `` We are disappointed that we will not be able to incorporate this new financial instrument into our stock repurchase program.'' `` At the same time, we applaud the innovative, creative efforts that <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> put into the project,'' he said. <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> owns 70.5 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION>'s outstanding stock. The companies on Dec. 5 each filed their plans to make the exchange and the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> staff has been reviewing those plans. Brokerage industry analysts said that while industry followers admired <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION>'s creativity in creating the <ORGANIZATION> USU </ORGANIZATION>, many institutional investors were skeptical about the plan. Some investors did n't like the idea that USUs would carry no voting rights. Others questioned whether there would be enough USUs in circulation to create a liquid market. And others were skeptical that the market price for the <ORGANIZATION> USU </ORGANIZATION> would match or exceed that for the common stock. Nonetheless, <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Gallatin </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> managing director who oversaw development of the USU concept, said he was confident there would have been enough institutions interested in making the swap that the `` exchange would have been successful.''

 American officials are uncertain whether an accord will be reached by the Japanese-set Friday deadline for a controversial jet fighter the two countries hope to build together, the White House said Wednesday. White House spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said the delay in reaching an accord to build the controversial FSX fighter is directly due to President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s insistence on safeguards to protect <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> technology. `` We do n't know. We'll take it a day at a time,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> told reporters when asked if the Friday deadline would be met. `` It's not a hard and fast, drop-dead deadline, either. We'll do the best we can,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. The Japanese government claims the agreement must be nailed down by Friday so that money for it can be included in its budget for the upcoming Japanese fiscal year, which begins April 1. `` We still ca n't put a timetable on it,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. He said talks were still progressing at `` other levels'' even though <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s chief negotiator on the project returned on Tuesday to <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>. `` The president's proposal and position on it has remaind rather firm through all of this, which is one of the reasons why it's taking so long,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has said he supports the project, negotiated by the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration, but only with certain conditions. Under the plan, <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dynamics </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Mitsubishi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Heavy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> would jointly build the new plane, to be modeled after the American-made F-16 fighter. In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, an official for <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday the Japanese government would sign a contract with <ORGANIZATION> Mitsubishi </ORGANIZATION> for development of the fighter jet, despite the continuing negotiations. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the government would sign the contract on Thursday or Friday for development of the FSX even if the two countries do not reach a final agreement on the project by then. <PERSON> Takaaki </PERSON> <PERSON> Yamada </PERSON>, vice president of <ORGANIZATION> Mitsubishi </ORGANIZATION>'s aircraft division, said the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>'s decision to sign the contract was `` a step forward in the FSX joint development project.'' A group of 43 legislators from <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s ruling <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> said <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> might want to build the aircraft on its own. The legislators presented a petition to the government urging that it proceed with development of the fighter, with or without <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> help. Japanese opponents have argued that <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> should scrap the accord and go ahead with its original plan to develop the jet on its own. Among the outstanding disputes are questions over who owns the technology that emerges from the project, how many of the fighters would be built in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, and how to protect sophisticated <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> computer software used to fly and control the plane. `` I'm told there are pieces of those issues that are still unresolved,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said.

 Four opposition parties opened talks on Wednesday about forming a coalition government they hope may replace the scandal-ridden Cabinet of Prime Minister <PERSON> Noboru </PERSON> <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>, whose popularity has nose-dived. The mass circulation newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Mainichi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shimbun </ORGANIZATION> reported Wednesday that only 9 percent of those responding to its poll supported <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>, the lowest rating since the newspaper began such surveys in 1947. In <ORGANIZATION> Mainichi </ORGANIZATION>'s last poll in December, support for <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> stood at 18 percent. The newspaper linked the sharp drop to a widening stock-profiteering scandal involving influential politicians, bureaucrats and businessmen, and to a new 3 percent sales tax that goes into effect on Saturday. <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> has rejected opposition demands that he resign and let the public give its verdict in new elections. After the latest polls, he reiterated a vow to push through political reforms to restore public trust in government. Elections for half the seats in the upper house of Parliament are due this summer. A serious setback could cost <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> his leadership of the governing <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and consequently his position as prime minister. Although the Liberal Democrats control both houses of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, opposition party secretary-generals agreed Wednesday their party chiefs should meet next week to discuss details of a coalition government. <PERSON> Tsuruo </PERSON> <PERSON> Yamaguchi </PERSON>, secretary-general of the <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, said the four parties agreed to give 11 of 22 Cabinet posts to the Socialists, including the prime minister's position. If the coalition came to power, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> might have its first woman prime minister _ <PERSON> Takako </PERSON> <PERSON> Doi </PERSON>, chairwoman of the Socialists, the largest opposition party. Others in the coalition would come from the Komeito -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Clean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Government </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> -RRB-, <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> parties. The opposition agreed to keep pressuring the government to force <PERSON> Yasuhiro </PERSON> <PERSON> Nakasone </PERSON> to testimony in parliament. He was prime minister at the time of stock transactions now being probed in the so-called Recruit scandal. Government refusal to summon <PERSON> Nakasone </PERSON> led to an opposition boycott that has halted debate in parliament on the budget for fiscal 1989, which begins Saturday. <ORGANIZATION> Recruit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, an information conglomerate, sold bargain-price unlisted shares in a subsidiary to about 150 influential figures, who profited when the shares soared in value after public sales began. Prosecutors have arrested 13 people on bribery and other charges in the scandal, including two former high-ranking government officials. Three Cabinet ministers resigned in connection with the scandal, and 17 politicians, including <PERSON> Nakasone </PERSON> and <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>, were linked to the stock deals. <ORGANIZATION> Mainichi </ORGANIZATION> said in reporting its record low popularity rating for <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> that it polled 2,257 adults in interviews March 24-26.

 The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar inched down against the Japanese yen after opening higher Thursday morning, while share prices fell on the <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. The dollar, which started at 133.27 yen, up 0.02 yen from Wednesday's finish, was changing hands at 133.05 yen at late morning. The currency moved in a range of 133.05-133 .30 yen The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, which rose 430.92 points Wednesday to a record high of 32,737.28 points, shed 74.05 points, or 0.23 percent, to finish morning trading at 32,663.23. The market's key index started higher following an upward trend of the last two days, but it reversed course as speculative investors began selling issues for profit taking, said a dealer with a major securities firm in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, speaking on condition of anonymity. Another dealer said some participants sold the Nikkei's spot issues to buy cheaper issues in the futures market to collect profits, which further pushed the prices lower. In currency dealings, the dollar started almost unchanged from the previous day's closing, following a similar trend in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> overnight after the concerted dollar-selling intervention by the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and European central banks, dealers said. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, the dollar closed at 133.15 yen Wednesday, just 0.02 yen lower from the previous day's closing. A dealer with the Bank of <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> said the dollar `` moved little'' as the close of the fiscal year for many Japanese businesses neared. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s fiscal year begins April 1. The uptrend of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> currency was eased as many Japanese market players slowed down their dollar-buying ahead of the upcoming `` Group of Seven'' meeting among officials of major industrialized nations, including the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, other dealers said. The meeting will be held in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> on Sunday.

As the 10.1 million-gallon spill spread over more than 500 square miles, a former top port official charged that cutbacks had left operators of the Port of <LOCATION> Valdez </LOCATION> with ill-maintained booms, no barge to take on oil and virtually no properly trained people to respond to the disaster. At least 40 people and five fishing boats were sent to protect one of the world's largest salmon hatcheries at <LOCATION> Port </LOCATION> <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Juan </LOCATION>. Other vessels made a stand at <LOCATION> Eshmay </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Main </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>. `` The spill is all over Prince <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sound </PERSON>,'' Gov. <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Cowper </PERSON> said. `` It is headed for <LOCATION> Montague </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strait </LOCATION>.'' Wind and currents have stretched the slick into ragged patches of shifting irridescent oil on crystal blue water. The heavy goo surrounds several islands _ gravel beaches and rocky points smeared with a black band of oil. The strait is an outlet to the Gulf of <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Cowper </PERSON> said that is where everyone hopes the oil goes, `` rather than bouncing around like a pinball in <LOCATION> Prince </LOCATION> <LOCATION> William </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sound </LOCATION> and polluting it for years.'' Once in the gulf, <PERSON> Cowper </PERSON> said, there is no way of telling where the oil might go. If it continues southwest as it has, it could jeopardize valuable fisheries around <LOCATION> Kodiak </LOCATION>. Valdez Mayor <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Devens </PERSON> has estimated the loss to the fishing industry at $ 150 million. Despite fears of immediate damage to the fisheries, some officials warned the worst may yet lie ahead. `` This spill will devastate the ecosystem long after wildlife that now has been exposed has died,'' said <PERSON> Jon </PERSON> <PERSON> Lyman </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Alaska </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fish </ORGANIZATION> and Game. He said thousands of birds, including bald eagles, may die in the coming years. Nearly 100 birds have been caught in the oil already. The oil invading estuaries and coves is far worse than is being described <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> and other official sources, said <PERSON> Kathy </PERSON> <PERSON> Frost </PERSON>, a marine mammal biologist. `` There are animals in the oil,'' she said. `` We do n't know what it will do with them. There have been few experiments. Now it's happening in real life. Meanwhile, <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> officials said they hoped to finish unloading the stricken tanker by Friday. <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Cornett </PERSON> said 390,000 of the 1 million barrels that were left on board after the spill had been pumped into the tanker <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Baton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>. Deputy Attorney General <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorenson </PERSON> arrived in <LOCATION> Valdez </LOCATION>, and said he was conducting a criminal investigation. The only crewman willing to talk to investigators has been <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Kagan </PERSON>, who was at the helm, <PERSON> Woody </PERSON> said. He told investigators he received a flurry of orders calling for hard turns just before the tanker went on `` a bumpy ride.'' Exxon officials said <PERSON> Hazelwood </PERSON> was not on the bridge when the tanker struck a reef one-half mile outside of established shipping lanes. Third mate <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON> <PERSON> Cousins </PERSON> was giving the orders. On the advice of their lawyers, <PERSON> Hazelwood </PERSON> and Cousins have refused to talk to investigators, <PERSON> Woody </PERSON> said, delaying a public inquiry by perhaps weeks. <PERSON> Hazelwood </PERSON>, who had his driver's license suspended because of a drunken driving conviction, was given a blood-alcohol test after the accident, but <PERSON> Woody </PERSON> said it may have been too late for the results to be conclusive. <PERSON> Hazelwood </PERSON>'s mother told The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> that her son had a history of alcohol abuse, and that <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> was aware of it. <PERSON> Cowper </PERSON> told a team dispatched by President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> that a federal takeover of the effort was unnecessary. `` Now, I think we've got a command situation I think is going to work,'' he said. Transportation Secretary <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> told <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> things were more positive than they appeared earlier in the week, <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> Administrator <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Reilly </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> Commandant <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Yost </PERSON> planned to return to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> on Thursday. Mayor <PERSON> Devens </PERSON> said his community felt `` a little betrayed'' by the oil industry and its inability to clean up the mess as it had promised. The <ORGANIZATION> Seattle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> reported in Wednesday's editions that the oil industry consortium operating the <LOCATION> Valdez </LOCATION> port had cut back its oil spill cleanup resources severely in recent years. The cutbacks prevented the consortium from acting quickly in the early hours of the spill when it still might have been contained, said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Woodle </PERSON>, retired <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> commander and general manager of the Port of <LOCATION> Valdez </LOCATION> from 1982 to 1984. `` You ca n't clean up everything in 48 hours,'' <PERSON> Woodle </PERSON> said. `` But you can contain it, and they could have done it with this one if they had the manpower, the initial response.'' <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Donnell </PERSON>, superintendent of the marine terminal at <LOCATION> Valdez </LOCATION>, said the consortium, <ORGANIZATION> Alyeska </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pipeline </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, was operating under a plan approved by state and federal authorities.
