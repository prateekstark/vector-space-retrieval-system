 Hundreds of people filled a school auditorium Friday night to remember with prayer and hymns the 10 victims of Wednesday's <ORGANIZATION> Pyro </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mining </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> disaster. Gov. <PERSON> Wallace </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilkinson </PERSON> said Kentuckians in general, and the families of <ORGANIZATION> Pyro </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mining </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> miners in particular, `` share in the immense grief.'' `` Tragedies like this one ... make us mindful of the fragile nature of the thread that holds us together,'' <PERSON> Wilkinson </PERSON> said during the service at <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> near this western <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> community. The auditorum, with seating for 700, appeared to be nearly filled. A large wreath with yellow mums and white carnations backed the podium onstage, with more flowers and ferns and a candle for each of the victims in the foreground. An <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> flag was at one side of the stage and the crowd sang `` Amazing Grace.'' In the investigation of <LOCATION> William </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Station </LOCATION> mine, near <LOCATION> Wheatcroft </LOCATION>, was delayed as officials of Pyro and state and federal agencies attempted to clear explosive levels of methane that persisted around the explosion site. Investigators entered the mine Friday afternoon in an attempt to reduce the hazardous methane levels. Officials of the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Mine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> approved, with modifications, a company plan for reducing methane levels, said <PERSON> Kathy </PERSON> <PERSON> Snyder </PERSON>, spokeswoman for <ORGANIZATION> MSHA </ORGANIZATION>. If the plan is successful, officials will remain underground and the probe will begin, she said. Earlier Friday, the head of a public-interest law firm said <PERSON> Pyro </PERSON> and federal authorities failed to prevent the disaster, even though there were plenty of warning signs. This year, federal inspectors briefly shut down the William Station Mine because of `` imminent dangers,'' said <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Davitt </PERSON> <PERSON> McAteer </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> Occupational </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>. Pyro reported 267 accidents at the underground mine since 1985, but failed to report several others, <PERSON> McAteer </PERSON> said. Last year, for example, an <ORGANIZATION> MSHA </ORGANIZATION> audit of mine records revealed <PERSON> Pyro </PERSON> did not report eight accidents at <LOCATION> William </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Station </LOCATION>, seven of which forced workers to miss work, <PERSON> McAteer </PERSON> said. Accidents also went unreported the two previous years, he said. <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Calman </PERSON>, a Pyro spokesman, refused to discuss the company's safety record He said <PERSON> Pyro </PERSON> would reserve further comment until company, state and federal officials completed their investigation of the accident, which was expected to take several weeks. <PERSON> McAteer </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> MSHA </ORGANIZATION> was too lenient on Pyro after it discovered blatant safety violations at William Station. He said <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Station </PERSON> had a coal-dust explosion in September 1988, which injured two miners, and a methane ignition three months later, which injured no one. In 1985, one miner was electrocuted at the mine and another died in an explosion, he said. The following year, another miner died at <LOCATION> William </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Station </LOCATION>, although <PERSON> McAteer </PERSON> said the report submitted to <ORGANIZATION> MSHA </ORGANIZATION> by the company did n't specify a cause of death. <ORGANIZATION> MSHA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Gorman </PERSON>, who could not immediately verify that <PERSON> Pyro </PERSON> failed to report some accidents, denied <PERSON> McAteer </PERSON>'s claim that his agency did not properly police <PERSON> Pyro </PERSON> was `` totally false.''

 For 12 years, <PERSON> Guenter </PERSON> <PERSON> Bachmann </PERSON> worked as a loading dock supervisor at a state cooperative in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. Then he got tired of not being able to say what he really thought. Last week, <PERSON> Bachmann </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Sabina </PERSON>, packed the family car with a few belongings and headed for <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> to join thousands of their countrymen streaming to the West over <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s border with <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>. `` It just hit me all of a sudden,'' the heavy-set 33-year-old <PERSON> Bachmann </PERSON> said outside a refugee camp in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s picturesque Bavarian countryside. `` I just finally had enough of never being able to say what I really thought, and there was no hint it was ever going to change.'' The estimated 14,000 East Germans who fled to the West via <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> in the past week come from all walks of life, ranging from laborers to tradesmen, from bakers to doctors and lawyers. Their exodus occurred amid increasing pressure for democratic reforms across <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, which has rejected the need for economic and political reforms under way in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> enjoys the best standard of living in the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc, but shortages are an aggravating fact of daily life. Dissent quickly is silenced by security forces. Demonstrators demanding democracy routinely are beaten and jailed. Public dissatisfaction in the hard-line <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> nation of 16 million has mounted steadily. According to the West German Ministry for Inter-German Affairs, 74 percent of East Germans who have come to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> since August left because of a lack of freedom of expression and human rights. The discontent is causing <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> to lose some of its best workers in the country's biggest drain of talent since the <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> Wall went up in 1961. A ministry report published Thursday said 55 percent of East German refugees who have come to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> since August are between 18 and 30 years old, and 86 percent have high levels of job training. The survey said the majority enjoyed relatively comfortable lifestyles in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. Nearly all owned a television, more than half of them color. Sixty-one percent owned cars, according to the report. But it was n't enough to keep them in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. `` When you read the state-owned newspapers, you feel like they really must take you for a fool,'' said <PERSON> Karl </PERSON> <PERSON> Dengler </PERSON>, a chemical engineering student from <LOCATION> Leipzig </LOCATION>, who was interviewed after crossing into the West. `` The paper declares one production success after another and <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s commitment to human rights, while in reality you still have to wait 15 years for what passes for a car and land in jail if you show a banner praising Soviet glasnost.'' <PERSON> Hermann </PERSON> <PERSON> Knorr </PERSON>, 25, said he decided to leave out of frustration at not being able to change the system. `` You talk and talk in small groups and nothing ever happens,'' said <PERSON> Knorr </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> member who was close to finishing a law degree in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>. `` When I finally gave up and tried to organize -LRB- illegal -RRB- discussion groups, the state security paid me a visit.'' <PERSON> Knorr </PERSON> said he had wanted to stay in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> but `` lost all hope.'' Many young refugees said the aggravations of daily life became unbearable when added to severe travel restrictions to the West and lack of free expression. `` When I applied for an apartment of my own, I was told that the wait would be 10 years,'' said <PERSON> Heidi </PERSON> <PERSON> Brueckl </PERSON>, who was a medical assistant in <LOCATION> Gera </LOCATION>. `` I get along with my parents all right, but I do n't think I need to live with them until I'm 35. I want to be able to live my own life.'' <PERSON> Anna </PERSON> <PERSON> Schroetter </PERSON>, a 27-year-old textile worker form <LOCATION> Leipzig </LOCATION>, said she was proud of some of the achievements of her country, especially social programs that guaranteed free day care and other services. `` But what good is day care and kindergarten when your children are drilled full of ideological nonsense? What good are guarantees of a job when you have no real say in the work place?'' she asked.

 Rock' n' roll pioneer <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> said Friday he's donating hundreds of videotapes, films and other memorabilia for a music museum in a 30-story pyramid being built along the <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>. `` I've got a great collection of stuff to share,'' <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Clark </PERSON>'s announcement was to have kicked off a night of parades, music and fireworks to mark the start of construction of the $ 56 million pyramid, intended as the centerpiece of a $ 200 million tourist theme park billed as a musical Disneyland. Then it rained, and the party was postponed 24 hours, leaving thousands of would-be revelers wandering aimlessly past soggy beer and souvenir stands, and the empty soundstages set up for street-party bands. Promoters had promised for weeks that the celebration, called The Big Dig, would be the biggest party <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION> had ever seen. But <PERSON> Sidney </PERSON> <PERSON> Shlenker </PERSON>, the man who will run the pyramid, said wet electronics made the affair too dangerous. Major events of The Big Dig included a fireworks display with a ton of explosives and a laser-light show outlining the shape of the 321-foot pyramid. Police said they had expected up to 100,000 spectators for the show but were unable to count the sparse crowd that showed up because it was too scattered through downtown. `` We're going to have the whole show tomorrow night,'' <PERSON> Shlenker </PERSON> said. `` It just got to a point tonight that the decision got taken out of our hands. It rained so hard that we've got pools of water. It's just too dangerous with the electrical equipment to risk peoples' lives.'' A late-night rock' n' roll concert featuring comedian <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Aykroyd </PERSON> and his <ORGANIZATION> Blues </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Review </ORGANIZATION> was to go on as scheduled at an amphitheater on the city's <LOCATION> Mud </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> tourist park near the pyramid site. <PERSON> Clark </PERSON>, who helped usher in rock' n' roll with his TV show `` American Bandstand,'' said the museum will be a hall of fame linked to his annual American Music Awards. The museum will include computerized displays with recordings and videotapes of the nation's musical past `` You'll be able to punch up a date and find out what musically was happening, what world events were happening and what it meant to your life,'' <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> said. The concrete and stainless steel pyramid is scheduled to open in May 1991. It is called `` The Great American Pyramid.''

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, anxious for money to launch the war on drugs, says he is ready to deal with <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Democrats seeking to expand the program by $ 2.2 billion now and enlarge it in the future. `` We're flexible in terms of the funding method,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said at a White House luncheon Friday. `` But I strongly believe we must return the integrated elements of this drug strategy which took more than six months to develop.'' His comment came as a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> bipartisan task force came away from two hours of negotiations Friday with Republicans promising to present a fresh financing plan when talks resume Monday. Meanwhile, the Rev. <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> select committee on narcotics the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> plan `` does not match the breadth of this social crisis'' and urged summit-style talks to draw up a new version. In the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, the Democratic plan to generate an additional $ 2.2 billion through a half-percent, across-the-board cut in federal programs remained part of a money bill for transportation programs awaiting final floor action. The administration opposes the idea, offered by <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appropriations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON>, D-W. <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, which would slice $ 1.8 billion from the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s `` We ca n't afford to sacrifice our military preparedness,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said Friday. Democrats were confident following the initial session of the task force made up of nine <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> and nine Democratic senators. `` It was a good step,'' <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> told a news conference. Democrats said, however, that money agreements reached now would be only a start on the drug war and that they have fundamental disagreements with the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration over what its size and scale should be. <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Biden </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, D-Del., said Democrats eventually want to expand the attack on cocaine dealers beyond what has been envisioned thus far by Republicans and provide more treatment and education National drug policy director <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>, author of the drug plan, says it most likely will be expanded in the future and an updated version is due in February. He also says the administration's request is a sharp increase over a drug-fighting budget that was only $ 2 billion three years ago. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> drew applause and scattered shouts of approval from spectators as he told the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> select committee on narcotics the nation needs `` a new initiative equal to the scope and depth of the problem.'' He criticized the plan for lack of enforcement strength, aid for the poor and input from national and community leaders with experience in fighting drugs. He said a meeting at the Camp David presidential retreat should be convened to redraw the strategy. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> was sharply critical of both <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> and the president. `` In April, Mr. <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> announced that he would take comprehensive emergency action to attack the drug crisis in the nation's capital,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said. `` Five months later, we still have the emergency but no action.'' `` President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> announced a drug plan for <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>. Where is his plan for the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> and cities around the nation?'' he said. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, reported to be weighing a race for mayor of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, suggested the nation's capital could be a model for fighting the drug scourge. He was asked what his role in that effort would be. `` A volunteer,'' he said.

The test, now undergoing trials at nine centers, will enable people to get results quickly in a doctor's office instead of having to wait to hear from a distant laboratory. `` It provides a new means for patients to learn of their AIDS status and still retain anonymity,'' said <PERSON> Jarel </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kelsey </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Murex </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> Norcross </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ga. </LOCATION>, firm that developed the test. `` Once this method is widely available, it will encourage more people to determine their status.'' Tests for AIDS now require that blood be drawn and sent to a laboratory for complex processing. Patients must wait to find out if they have contracted the human immunodeficiency virus, or HIV, which causes acquired immune deficiency syndrome, or AIDS. `` That can take a number of days sometimes,'' said <PERSON> Kelsey </PERSON>. Concern about whether the test information will be kept confidential and the long wait for results discourage some people from being tested for AIDS, even though they may be at risk for the disease, he said. The new test, called SUDS for single use diagnostic system, takes away some of that anxiety. It consists of a small plastic disk, slightly thicker than a camera lens cap, that is filled with an absorbent material. A cone-shaped indention on top leads down to a small hole that exposes the absorbent material. A SUDS test starts with a blood sample obtained from a simple finger stick. Two drops of serum, the clear fluid in blood, are separated from the sample and then combined with two reactant solutions. The mixture is poured into the cone of the test cartridge. Inside the tester, the sample mixture is absorbed and pulled through a color reactant. If a dot on the bottom of the disk remains white, there is no AIDS virus. A blue dot means an AIDS infection. The whole process takes about 10 minutes. <PERSON> Kelsey </PERSON> said the system works through the use of microscopic latex beads that are coated with proteins that react to AIDS antibodies. An antibody is a molecule in the blood produced by the body's immune system to attack specific invaders, such as bacteria or virus. The proteins used in SUDS react to antibodies created by the immune system in response to both the outer membrane and the core of the HIV virus. SUDS is being tested at selected doctors' offices, sexual disease clinics, hospitals and blood banks. The trials started in July and more than 5,000 tests have been conducted. `` The trials so far have shown an average accuracy rate of 99.8 percent,'' said <PERSON> Kelsey </PERSON>. `` Any specimen that has evidence of AIDS antibody has been detected by the system so we are really achieving levels of 100 percent sensitivity.'' Clinical trials of SUDS end in October and the <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> is expected to approve a license quickly, <PERSON> Kelsey </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Brad </PERSON> <PERSON> Stone </PERSON> said the agency does not announce its intentions ahead of time and will have to study the data. But he noted, `` We recognize the need to get any test for AIDS out as soon as possible.'' Although the SUDS test is very simple to conduct, <PERSON> Kelsey </PERSON> said it will not be sold for home use. `` Everybody is aware that exposure to the HIV is a terminal condition,'' he said. `` Having that information revealed without counseling immediately available could be a traumatic experience.''

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is standing by his opposition to a federal ban on assault weapons, saying he doubts such a law `` could ever safeguard'' against a tragedy like the shooting rampage in <LOCATION> Louisville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION> `` I have seen no evidence that banning a specific weapon is going to guard against it,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said Friday, referring to the shooting spree in a printing plant the day before that left eight dead and 13 wounded. The president, at a news conference, called the shootings the work of a deranged individual and said, `` It is terrible, and the loss of human life is horrible.'' But <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, a life member of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rifle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, said instead of enacting new laws, `` we must do everything we can to enforce laws that are already on the books.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was spending the weekend at the presidential retreat in Camp David, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, before heading west on a two-day trip next week. He will participate in bicentennial ceremonies in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> on Monday. At the news conference for out-of-town reporters, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also: _ Repeated his opposition to raising federal taxes to pay for the war against drugs, but said he would not criticize state or local governments that did so _ Said the nation's education system `` is not making the grade'' and hoped his Sept. 27-28 education summit with the nation's governors would lead to national educational goals and objectives for _ Rejected a suggestion that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> divert funds from its contribution to <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> to pay for the drug war `` Let's not let down our alliance guarantees because we are more optimistic about peace,'' he said. _ Indicated he was giving `` serious and active'' consideration to using former military bases to house prisoners from overcrowded prisons <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was asked what he would tell the families of victims of Thursday's shooting spree in a <LOCATION> Louisville </LOCATION> printing plant in which a worker with several automatic weapons went from floor to floor shooting down former co-workers. `` I'd tell them I feel horrible about the loss of life.'' But, he added, `` I would tell them I do n't think banning weapons is going to be the ultimate answer or could ever safeguard against that kind of tragedy.'' He recalled automatic weapons were not involved in the 1966 shooting spree by <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Whitman </PERSON>, who climbed to the top of a tower at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Austin </LOCATION> with three rifles, two pistols and a shotgun. He shot 44 people, killing 14, before being killed himself. He also said that in the 1960s, when he was a member of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Representatives </ORGANIZATION>, he went to a police station in the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> to register `` my arsenal'' of a rifle and a shotgun to comply with the law. `` The guy looked at me like I'd lost his mind,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, adding that only a small percentage of gun owners were complying with the law. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he asked the officer if police were `` getting a lot of criminals to turn their guns in? `` He said, ` No. It's just a bunch of suckers like you from <LOCATION> Northwest </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>.' And it made a profound impression on me.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> banned the import of foreign-made assault rifles into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, including the AK-47, the weapon used in <LOCATION> Louisville </LOCATION>. However, possession of these weapons is not a federal offense, nor does the import ban prevent them from being manufactured domestically.

 <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> has White House approval to proceed with its much-debated October launch of a nuclear-powered satellite to <LOCATION> Jupiter </LOCATION>. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s science adviser, <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Allan </PERSON> <PERSON> Bromley </PERSON>, signed the authorization Friday which is required before a nuclear device is put into space. <PERSON> Bromley </PERSON> had the president's approval, said <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Alixe </PERSON> <PERSON> Reed </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> Administrator <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Truly </PERSON> was informed, she said. The mission would have been scrubbed had White House approval been withheld. Critics worried about nuclear fallout in case of an accident will ask a court to stop the launch, and promise to try to put their bodies in the way if that does n't work. The Galileo probe will be sent on its eight-year, $ 1.4 billion mission from the cargo bay of the space shuttle <LOCATION> Atlantis </LOCATION> _ the first time nuclear power has been carried on a shuttle. The three men and two women who will be on the Oct. 12 mission were in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> today for a breakfast with Vice President <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> at his residence. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, who intends to be at the Kennedy Space Center for the liftoff, heads the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> and was particularly interested in meeting the astronauts because shuttle commander <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> is from <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s home state. Protesters claim a Challenger-like accident could poison Earth's atmosphere with `` the most toxic substance in the universe. They are preparing to file suit in federal court to stop the mission and a protest march is scheduled to begin at <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canaveral </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION> on Sunday. <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Gagnon </PERSON>, a leader in the <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION>, said `` we are going to attempt to enter the launch area and sit on the launch pad.'' He has written that `` Plutonium 238 is the most toxic substance in the universe. If ingested, it concentrates in the bone marrow where it can cause leukemia. If inhaled, it sticks to the lungs, where it can lead to cancer.'' The Galileo spacecraft was originally scheduled for launch in January 1982 but was delayed time and again. It is outfitted with two radioisotope thermoelectric generators to produce the electricity for the spacecraft, science instruments and engineering support systems. Of the 22 <ORGANIZATION> RTGs </ORGANIZATION> used on previous missions, three have been involved in accidents _ one releasing 17,000 curies of radioactive material 75 miles high over the <LOCATION> Indian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION>. The generators use the heat from the radioactive decay of plutonium-238 dioxide to generate electricity. <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> estimates the probability of having a launch accident that results in the release of plutonium into the atmosphere is one in 2,800. RTGs similar to the ones on Galileo provided the power for Voyager 2, which recently sent back spectacular views of the planet <LOCATION> Neptune </LOCATION>. Voyager 2, launched in 1977, was the last spacecraft carrying a nuclear power source.

 Rainshowers canceled a huge shindig to celebrate the construction of a 30-story pyramid, but organizers said they would try again after mopping up flooded beer stands and stages set up for street-party bands. The party will go on tonight, weather permitting. `` It just got to a point tonight that the decision got taken out of our hands. It rained so hard that we've got pools of water,'' developer <PERSON> Sidney </PERSON> <PERSON> Shlenkler </PERSON> said Friday. Promoters had promised for weeks that the event would be the biggest party <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION> had ever seen. Police had expected up to 100,000 people, and several thousand would-be revelers showed up despite the downpour. At a luncheon to kick off the celebration, rock' n' roll pioneer <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> announced he will supply hundreds of videotapes, films and other memorabilia for a music museum in the pyramid. <PERSON> Clark </PERSON>, who helped popularize rock' n' roll with his TV show American Bandstand, said the music hall of fame will be linked to his annual American Music Awards show and include computerized displays with recordings and videotapes of the nation's musical past. The stainless steel pyramid, which is being built along the <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, is intended as the centerpiece of a $ 200 million tourist theme park billed as a musical <ORGANIZATION> Disneyland </ORGANIZATION> and scheduled to open in May 1991.

 The attorney for <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> says he'll try to convince a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee not to subpoena the former housing secretary, but lawmakers say <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>'s refusal to appear voluntarily leaves them no choice. The chairman of the panel investigating abuses at the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> said Friday he would ask members to approve a subpoena next week. Republicans joined majority Democrats in saying they would support the request. <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Perito </PERSON>, said he would try to convince the subcommittee next week to give <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> two weeks to prepare and then allow him to testify voluntarily. In another development, Rep. <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Morrison </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Conn </LOCATION>., asked the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> on Friday to ask Attorney General <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> to name a special prosecutor and have a grand jury investigate actions at <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> during <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>'s tenure There was no immediate action on the request. The House Government Operations subcommittee on housing and employment subcommittee denied <PERSON> Perito </PERSON>'s request Friday for a two-week extension for <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> to testify. `` I am at a loss to understand why there is such a concern for speed over truth,'' said <PERSON> Perito </PERSON>. <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> told the subcommittee Thursday evening he would not appear the next morning, prompting a number of verbal attacks from the panel's members. `` We have no option but to proceed in teaching Mr. <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> that while he may run, he may not hide,'' said subcommittee Chairman <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Lantos </PERSON>, D-Calif. `` Not only is Silent <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> silent, apparently today he's also invisible,'' added Rep. <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> `` Buz'' <ORGANIZATION> Lukens </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> R-Ohio </LOCATION>, using the derogatory nickname <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> acquired for his low-profile demeanor as secretary during the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration The subpoena vote is scheduled for Wednesday, but it was unclear when the panel would demand that <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> appear. <PERSON> Perito </PERSON> said <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> most likely would comply with any subpoena but left open the possibility of fighting an order if it gave <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> less than two weeks to prepare. `` You can be assured that I will consider all options,'' <PERSON> Perito </PERSON> said. The panel is investigating allegations that prominent Republicans and former <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> officials got favored treatment from the agency under <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>, some making huge profits as consultants obtaining multimillion-dollar federal housing contracts. The department also is still unable to account for millions of dollars in connection with projects and home sales during <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>'s eight years as secretary Critics blame poor management. <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials have said more than 1,000 HUD-related cases are being reviewed by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorneys around the country, and there have been a handful of criminal and civil cases filed in recent months.

<TEXT>
 The government is intensifying its investigations of possibly defective seat belts in <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aerostar </ORGANIZATION> vans and of bus arm rests blamed for injuries to nine people in a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> accident. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Highway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> also announced a new investigation Friday of <ORGANIZATION> Mazda </ORGANIZATION> seat belts and 10 other new investigations of cars, mobile homes, utility vehicles and motorcycles made by <PERSON> Chevrolet </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Pontiac </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Yamaha </ORGANIZATION>, Jeep, <ORGANIZATION> Porsche </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Jaguar </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Isuzu </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON>, Mobile and <LOCATION> Kawasaki </LOCATION>. Such investigations are used to determine whether to order a recall of the vehicles. The agency said it had upgraded its examination of Aerostars manufactured between 1986 and 1988 from a paperwork analysis to an engineering analysis, which involves studying the allegedly defective parts. The <ORGANIZATION> NHTSA </ORGANIZATION> opened a preliminary evaluation in December 1988 after receiving seven complaints of fraying front-seat, passenger-side seat belts. `` Something sharp is rubbing against the belt, apparently,'' said agency spokesman <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> Hurd </PERSON>. The agency conducted a survey and detected other cases of fraying but no injuries resulting from the problem, <PERSON> Hurd </PERSON> said, adding, `` We're always concerned about seat belts. They double your chances of surviving a head-on collision.'' In <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Joy </PERSON> <PERSON> Stinson </PERSON> said 450,000 Aerostars were built between 1986 and 1988. Of those, 338,000 were equipped with a plastic cover that shields the seat belt from contact with the metal hinge, Ms. <PERSON> Stinson </PERSON> said. Belt fraying is believed to be limited to vans without the plastic cover, which the company began installing in 1987 to protect the hinge and improve the seat's appearance, she said. <ORGANIZATION> NHTSA </ORGANIZATION> also said it was upgrading to an engineering analysis a probe of 1988 <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coach </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> inter-city buses. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> requested a preliminary evaluation June 5 after a bus crashed in <LOCATION> Tinton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Falls </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION> Nine passengers were hurt when arm rests broke, leaving sharp edges. Also, the agency began a preliminary inquiry into other arm rests made between 1984 and 1989 by <ORGANIZATION> Wakefield </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Seating </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, the manufacturer of the <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coach </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> seat rests. The <ORGANIZATION> Mazda </ORGANIZATION> probe is of seat belts in all cars the company manufactured between 1984 and 1989 following 11 complaints of 15 injuries resulting from failure to restrain passengers in accidents. <ORGANIZATION> NHTSA </ORGANIZATION> also reported launching preliminary evaluations of: _ Breaking buckles on <ORGANIZATION> Chevrolet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Camaros </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Pontiac </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Firebirds </ORGANIZATION> built in 1984 through 1986 The probe covers an estimated 500,000 cars. _ Malfunctioning throttle grip sticks on 1989 <ORGANIZATION> Yamaha </ORGANIZATION> FZR400 and FZR600 <ORGANIZATION> Yamaha </ORGANIZATION> motorcycles The probe covers 10,000 cycles. _ Malfunctioning rear seat belts in Jeep Cherokees, Wranglers and Wagoneers The probe covers the 1984 through 1988 model years. _ Smoke and fires under the dashboards of 1987 Porsche 924 and Porsche 944 models covering 7,500 cars _ Anti-lock brake system failures in 1987 through 1989 models of the <ORGANIZATION> Jaguar </ORGANIZATION> XJ6 _ Ball-joint failures in 50,000 1988 Isuzu Impulses after three complaints of collapsed front suspensions causing loss of vehicle control _ Power-steering failure in 1988 <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lincoln </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Continentals </ORGANIZATION>, covering 40,000 cars _ Detaching spare tire mounts on Mobile Class A motor homes, covering about 7,000 vehicles from 1988 and 1989 _ Detaching handlebars on 1,000 <ORGANIZATION> Kawasaki </ORGANIZATION> ZX-7 motorcycles from 1989

<HEAD>Tail of a Turf Battle Over Surf Products</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The federal government believes it's time to inspect seafood for safety, but two agencies are arguing over just who should put the final stamp of approval on the fish. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> is being asked to resolve the turf battle, which comes down to the question of whether fish are wild animals or should be treated like the chickens and cattle that are raised for food. Almost certain, however, is that the low-fat food source health-conscious Americans have been turning to in large numbers is going to come under closer government scrutiny. `` Currently many consumers are wary about the safety of fish,'' Rep. <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Waxman </PERSON>, D-Calif. `` They have heard many stories about contamination from toxic industrial and agricultural chemicals, medical waste products and red tides. <PERSON> Waxman </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee on health and the environment began considering legislation Friday that would have the <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> set up a comprehensive federal inspection program of the seafood industry. Contaminants for regular fish and shellfish include the botulism toxin, ciguatoxin, scombrotroxin, salmonella bacteria and the hepatitis-A virus, not to mention PCBs and other industrial contaminants. Although everyone at the hearing agreed seafood needs to be inspected, but <PERSON> Waxman </PERSON>'s plan drew criticism from the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, which wants to bring fish under its meat and poultry inspection program. `` We would not have to start from scratch,'' said <PERSON> Lester </PERSON> <PERSON> Crawford </PERSON>, administrator of the food safety and inspection service at the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, noting the experience with meat and poultry. The `` principles of inspection are the same regardless of the species,'' he said. The <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> has been named as the inspection agency for fish in legislation since 1986, but <PERSON> Waxman </PERSON>'s `` Fish and Fish Products Safety Act of 1989'' would require the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> to set safety standards. <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> Commissioner <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON> said it's simple: fish are not like chickens and cattle. `` Here we are capturing wild animals,'' he said. `` I do n't do this with any kind of turf comparison, but when one looks at the chicken and beef, these are animals that are raised in standard ways. They are housed and they are brought to the market in a chain that is known.'' Witnesses said that whichever government agency gets the task, consumer education should be improved because many problems deal with errors in handling seafood at home. <PERSON> Ellen </PERSON> <PERSON> Haas </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Voice </ORGANIZATION>, a non-profit group dealing with food safety issues, said federal statistics indicate the risk of a food poisoning outbreak from eating seafood is 25 times greater than from beef, and 16 times greater than for either chicken or pork. Seafood consumption has been increasing as a result of efforts to find low-fat sources of protein. <PERSON> Young </PERSON> said there have been signs of a decline, although he said the reason was unclear.

<HEAD>US Urges Other Nations to Take in Soviet Refugees</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> is calling on other nations to ease the burden on the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> by taking in some of the recent surge of emigres from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. Deputy Secretary of State <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Eagleburger </PERSON> issued the call Friday as he defended the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration from criticism that a proposal to allow 50,000 Soviet refugees into the country in the next year is too conservative. `` I resent the implication that we have some heartless, niggardly, conservative approach to this problem,'' <PERSON> Eagleburger </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee on immigration. `` But there are limits on the numbers we can take,'' he said, citing budgetary constraints and the press of refugees worldwide seeking to come to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` No budget deficit, however large, should ever induce the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to abandon or compromise in any way its fundamental values and principles'' of granting safe haven to `` oppressed peoples,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Orrin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hatch </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Utah </LOCATION>. Sen. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, D-Mass., chairman of the subcommittee, said the months of administration deliberations on its Soviet refugees strategy had given the impression that `` you're dealing with cans of beans rather than human beings. Some 150,000 applications for entry _ mostly from Jews and some Pentacostals _ are expected in the 1990 fiscal year. Critics say that leaves the administration's quota figure too low. For nearly 20 years the demand for liberalized Soviet emigration was a cornerstone of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy, but `` never was it said that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> has an obligation to take them all in'' if the gates open, <PERSON> Eagleburger </PERSON> said. He said <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> should also offer entry to the Soviets, although he conceded attempts to enlist the other countries' help over the past few months had not borne fruit. `` I ca n't tell you there will be a massive willingness on the part of other countries,'' he said, `` but we'll continue trying.'' Under existing procedures, most Soviet emigres leave the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> with <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> visas but change course for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> once they reach processing centers in <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>. Only about 10 percent to 15 percent go to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. To save money, the administration will shut down the <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> facilities once it clears up the backlog of an estimated 30,000 applicants there, and process all applicants in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> after Oct. 1, <PERSON> Eagleburger </PERSON> said.

 A federal judge's ruling will help ensure that presidential records are preserved for future generations, says a lawyer involved in a suit over <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration computer records. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Richey </PERSON> on Friday rejected a <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration motion to dismiss the case, saying private citizens may go to court to keep the government from erasing computer records dealing with the Iran-Contra affair. <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents and congressional investigators delving into the Iran-Contra affair used thousands of messages retrieved from the system, called PROFS, in piecing together the most far-reaching scandal of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration. Former White House aide <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON> and former national security adviser <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON> used the system, which serves as a substitute for the telephone. <PERSON> Richey </PERSON>'s decision `` goes a long way toward ensuring that ... records produced by the president'' are `` preserved for future generations so that chapters of history are not lost,'' said <PERSON> Katherine </PERSON> <PERSON> Meyer </PERSON>, one of the lawyers who filed the case. <PERSON> Richey </PERSON> said the Administrative Procedures Act empowers a private group to seek judicial review of the president's performance under the Presidential Records Act and the Federal Records Act. He gave the government and private groups and individuals filing the suit until Jan. 2 to decide how to proceed. The National Security Archive, a non-profit organization, went to court Jan. 19 after learning the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> White House was about to dispose of the contents of the PROFS computer system. On the eve of the change in administrations, a judge temporarily enjoined the government from destroying the material. It includes computer tapes of the <ORGANIZATION> NSC </ORGANIZATION> and the executive office of the president as well as back-up computer files. <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> lawyers argue most of the notes are n't presidential or agency records, but are like telephone messages The judge questioned that assertion in a 28-page opinion. `` Were telephone conversations in the Executive Branch routinely taped, a good portion would undoubtedly qualify as presidential or agency records,'' the judge said.

 <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Penn </PERSON> <PERSON> Warren </PERSON>, who won the Pulitzer Prize three times for his novels and poetry and was named the nation's first poet laureate, has died after a three-year battle with cancer. <PERSON> Warren </PERSON>, 84, died early Friday at his summer home. His wife, the author <PERSON> Eleanor </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON>, and a local doctor were with him, said <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON>, his longtime friend and <PERSON> Stratton </PERSON>'s town clerk and treasurer. Services will be private, with a public memorial service scheduled later, said a spokesman for the Covey and <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> Funeral Home in <LOCATION> Wilmington </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> was the first to win Pulitzer Prizes in both poetry and fiction. The poetry prizes came in 1957 for `` Promises: Poems 1954-1956,'' and in 1979 for `` Now and Then: Poems 1976-1978.'' His novel `` All the King's Men,'' a book about the myth surrounding <PERSON> Huey </PERSON> <PERSON> Long </PERSON>, the swaggering populist governor of <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>, won the Pulitzer in 1947 and became an Academy Award-winning motion picture. His other awards include the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Literature </ORGANIZATION> and the Gold Medal for Poetry from the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arts </ORGANIZATION> and Letters. He also was among the first recipients of the <ORGANIZATION> MacArthur </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>'s unrestricted `` genius grants. <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> was remembered as a brilliant poet, fiction writer, teacher and critic _ and as a nice man. `` He had such vigor and such love of life. He was such wonderful company _ he was the soul of hilarity,'' said novelist and short story writer <PERSON> Eudora </PERSON> <PERSON> Welty </PERSON>, whose first work was published in the <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Review </ORGANIZATION> when <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> was editor in the 1930s. `` He was a good friend to writers _ constantly generous and giving.'' `` He was reticent, ironic, reserved and perfectly charming, and I loved and respected him quite apart from his work,'' said poet <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Nemerov </PERSON>, who owns a copy of the first edition of <PERSON> Warren </PERSON>'s first book His fellow writers marveled at his versatility and virtuosity. `` He's astounding,'' said poet <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Bly </PERSON>. `` It's very seldom that someone can write poetry and fiction and do it well. In fiction, you take nine or ten generations and compress them; in poetry, you take 30 seconds and expand it.'' Born in <LOCATION> Guthrie </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>, on April 24, 1905, <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> grew up hearing tales of the Civil War from his two grandfathers who had been Confederate soldiers. <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> graduated summa cum laude from <ORGANIZATION> Vanderbilt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in 1925, received a master's degree from the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Berkeley </LOCATION> and studied at <ORGANIZATION> Oxford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> as a Rhodes Scholar. While teaching at <ORGANIZATION> Louisiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, he was a founder of <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Review </ORGANIZATION>. From 1938 to 1961, he was an editorial adviser to the <ORGANIZATION> Kenyon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Review </ORGANIZATION>. His first full-length novel, published in 1939, was `` Night Rider,'' about the plight of <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> tobacco growers at the turn of the century. Other works included `` At Heaven's Gate,'' `` World Enough and Time,'' `` Band of Angels,'' `` Wilderness: A Tale of the Civil War,'' and `` Flood: A Romance for Our Time.'' In 1986, <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> was appointed poet laureate, a largely ceremonial title created by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. `` The people who create these posts do n't give a damn about poetry,'' <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> said of the appointment. `` They do it because it's a nice thing to do They think ` There's a poet down the road; let's make him a poet laureate.' <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> lived the last three decades of his life in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>. Before his second marriage, to Ms. <PERSON> Clark </PERSON>, she had suggested that they return to the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> so that their children would know his world. `` But I discovered it was n't the same world,'' <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> once said. `` I had been carrying a dream around in my head.''

<TEXT>
 On a sun-drenched day, <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> pulled out its cleanup crews for the winter and the state announced its own plan to protect fish hatcheries and untainted areas from the Exxon Valdez oil spill. `` It's a nice day for the first day of winter, is n't it?'' Gov. <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Cowper </PERSON> said Friday before he announced the state's plans for a $ 21 million program `` to continue cleanup work left by <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION>.'' But for that bit of sarcasm, and a crack by his spokesman about a `` dirty dozen of soiled beaches'' left by <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Cowper </PERSON> was conciliatory toward the oil company responsible for the March 24 tanker wreck that left 10.9 million gallons of crude oil in Prince <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sound </PERSON>. The governor thanked the thousands of workers who helped scrub the oil-fouled shorelines, proclaiming Friday `` Oil Spill Workers Appreciation Day'' in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> pulled the crews out Friday, saying <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>'s early winter makes continuing field work too risky. `` I think Exxon has made a good-faith effort to clean up the beaches,'' <PERSON> Cowper </PERSON> said. `` I'm not going to fault Exxon here. They made some mistakes and, frankly, some of the things the state has done were mistakes.'' <PERSON> Cowper </PERSON> said the state should have known how to clean up a major spill. `` At least we should have known no one else knew how to do it,'' he said. <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>'s winter program, announced on a warm fall day when residents donned T-shirts and shorts, calls for: _ Small-scale cleanups when fish and wildlife resources are threatened by the remaining oil _ Monitoring the oil's movement and changes in its composition during the region's severe winter months _ Research and development of new ways to remove the remaining oil, most of which lies under the surface of rocky shorelines _ Protecting the region's five fish hatcheries with standby equipment and crews _ Forming a strike force of counselors and mental-health professionals to help prevent and treat stress-related problems, such as drug and alcohol abuse, in spill-affected towns Money for the program will come from the state's new 5-cent-a-barrel oil-spill response tax. <PERSON> Cowper </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> eventually will be billed for reimbursement. While <PERSON> Cowper </PERSON> had little negative to say about <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION>, he showed reporters a seven-minute, state-produced video that focused on the oiled shores the company has vacated. On a nearby table were oiled rocks taken this week from what a Cowper spokesman said were soiled beaches. <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Beathard </PERSON> said later that the beaches where surface oil remains visible were the last treated with a chemical fertilizer. The fertilizer, which stimulates the oil-eating action of microorganisms, takes up to six weeks to work. State environmental officials are worried about the subsurface oil. They fear winter storms and tidal action will loosen that oil, resulting in small slicks that will pollute other areas. Although <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> has promised to monitor the oil and respond to emergencies during the fall and winter, <PERSON> Cowper </PERSON> said it remained unclear to what extent the company will work with the state. <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> has said it will re-evaluate the shorelines next spring and decide then whether to resume the cleanup on a large scale. The governor noted that some biologists alleged recently that <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION>'s cleanup, which employed as many as 12,000 workers, may have done more environmental harm than good. `` That may be,'' <PERSON> Cowper </PERSON> said. `` But what was Exxon going to do? Not only was everyone barking at them to get it done, including us, they had a public relations problem.''

Monitors at the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Earthquake </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Golden </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colo. </LOCATION>, measured the quake at 6.6 on the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale. The Armenian earthquake registered 6.9 on the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale, a gauge of the energy released by a temblor, as measured by the ground motion recorded on a seismograph. A quake measuring 6 can cause severe damage and a temblor measuring 7 can cause widespread, heavy damage. Ms. <PERSON> Molchanova </PERSON> said there were no immediate reports of casualties. She said the quake registered 7 on the Soviet earthquake scale in <LOCATION> Krasnovodsk </LOCATION>, a city on the eastern shore of the <LOCATION> Caspian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Turkmenia </LOCATION>. The Soviet scale is based on observable effects of an earthquake. A quake registering 7 is regarded as `` very strong,'' capable of making cracks in stone walls. It registered at 5 in <LOCATION> Baku </LOCATION>, strong enough to wake the sleeping and shake furniture.

At a court hearing in <LOCATION> Fredericton </LOCATION> Thursday, the two were ordered held for trial next month on charges of smuggling a half-ton of cocaine in the nose of an airplane. It was the largest seizure of cocaine by Canadian police. The five South Americans, arrested in <LOCATION> Edmunston </LOCATION>, 125 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Fredericton </LOCATION>, had Venezuelan passports. But in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Shults </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> said two were ` known to be Colombians.'' The agency sent several agents to <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> on Friday to discuss the case with Canadian authorities, <PERSON> Shults </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> Fredericton </LOCATION> police said they were seeking up to three others in the case. Canadian police ruled out suggestions the five arrested were hired killers sent by Colombian drug traffickers to murder <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> or Canadian officials or to attack President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s vacation home in <LOCATION> Kennebunkport </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> late Friday, <ORGANIZATION> Secret </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Vezeris </PERSON> said, `` We do not believe it has anything to do with threats to individuals in this country.'' The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has sent <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> $ 65 million in aid, including military equipment, for its month-old crackdown on the nation's drug cartels, which provide most of the cocaine sold in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Canadian and <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> officials say the cartels increasingly are smuggling drugs through <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>'s maritime provinces because the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has tightened its borders. When Mounted Police and <LOCATION> Edmundston </LOCATION> authorities arrested four of the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> men, a search of their vehicles uncovered an Uzi submachine gun, Soviet and Israeli assault rifles and 3,000 rounds of ammunition. Also seized were six automatic pistols, a .22 - caliber pistol, tear gas, a deactivated Japanese grenade and an electric zap gun used to knock people On Friday, police led the four handcuffed into a heavily guarded provincial court in <LOCATION> Edmundston </LOCATION>, where they were charged with a variety of weapons offenses. `` Innocent, innocent. Je suis innocent,'' one of the men told reporters outside the courthouse. `` No speak English,'' said another. Authorities have identified the four as <PERSON> Tito </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanchez </PERSON>, <PERSON> Euovio </PERSON> <PERSON> Manzano </PERSON>, <PERSON> Osvaldo </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzales </PERSON> and <PERSON> Wilmer </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramon </PERSON> <PERSON> Zanabria </PERSON>. Court documents did not contain their ages or hometowns. They were being held for bail hearings set for Tuesday. A fifth man, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Caracas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>, was arrested Thursday in another provincial city. He was charged Friday in Saint <PERSON> John </PERSON> with possessing two .22 - caliber Authorities said they expected to charge him later with an immigration offense. <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> was being held until a bail hearing Monday. The Colombians accused of cocaine trafficking, <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Galindo-Escobar </PERSON> and <PERSON> Fernando </PERSON> <PERSON> Augusto </PERSON> <PERSON> Mendoza-Jaramillo </PERSON>, both 36, were arrested in April after police found about 1,100 pounds of the drug inside the nose of an airplane at a makeshift airstrip outside <LOCATION> Fredericton </LOCATION>.

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> McDonnell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> says it will make changes in its DC-10 jetliners to guard against failure of all three hydraulic systems, the `` one in a billion'' condition in a DC-10 crash in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> that killed 112 people. The modifications were greeted warmly Friday by <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Busey </PERSON>, the head of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>. `` The system design changes proposed by <ORGANIZATION> McDonnell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION> ... are a solid step forward in assuring there will be no repeat of the July 19 accident,'' <PERSON> Busey </PERSON> said in a statement issued in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION> `` Once these design changes are in place, they will raise the already high safety standards required of the DC-10 and, in effect, make a good airplane even better.'' The three hydraulic systems on the DC-10 are designed to operate independently and to back each other up in case one fails. Unlike some other plane models, the 400 or so DC-10s in use around the world have no backup system if the hydraulic lines fail to control the wing and tail mechanisms that steer the plane. `` We view the new enhancements as extra safety equipment similar to the installation of air bags in automobiles _ additional measures to protect occupants besides the lap belts, shoulder harnesses, padded dashboards, etc.,'' said <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> Warren </PERSON>, a vice president of <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aircraft </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Warren </PERSON>, who headed the company's investigation of the <LOCATION> Sioux </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, crash, said Friday modifications will include: _ An electrically operated shutoff valve that will be installed in the supply line and a check valve in the return line of the 3 hydraulic system. _ A check valve installed in the No 3 hydraulic reservoir. _ A cockpit light added to alert the crew if the shutoff valve is activated The new fast-acting shutoff valve, located just behind the back wall of the cabin, will close automatically and the cockpit light will come on if a sensor detects hydraulic fluid dropping below a preset level in the reservoir. Even if all three hydraulic systems are affected by severe damage to the tail section, as happened in <LOCATION> Sioux </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, the valve will stop fluid flow through the No. 3 system, <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> said. With adequate hydraulic pressure preserved in that system, the crew should have enough control to fly the plane to a safe landing, he said. In the July crash, the tail engine on the DC-10 disintegrated, knocking out all three hydraulic systems _ an event with a `` one in a billion'' chance of occurring, according to a <ORGANIZATION> McDonnell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION> release Friday. The pilot lost virtually all control of the plane, which exploded in flames in a corn field after cartwheeling down the runway. <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aircraft </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, a division of <ORGANIZATION> McDonnell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION> based in <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, manufactured the DC-10s, which will eventually be replaced by the more advanced but similar MD-11s. <ORGANIZATION> McDonnell </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Elayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Bendel </PERSON> said in a telephone interview that the company had yet to decide whether to make the same modifications to its MD-11s.

 Miss <PERSON> Oklahoma </PERSON> will compete in tonight's <LOCATION> Miss </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> Pageant despite suffering a concussion from a beer bottle thrown during a beauty parade, officials said. <PERSON> Tamara </PERSON> <PERSON> Denise </PERSON> <PERSON> Toshiko </PERSON> <PERSON> Marler </PERSON>, 26, of <LOCATION> Tulsa </LOCATION>, was riding in the glitzy Miss America Parade down the famed Boardwalk Friday night when the bottle hit her in the forehead, said pageant director <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> <PERSON> Horn </PERSON>. `` It was obviously some malicious moron who hoped he could hit something, and obviously he did,'' he said. Miss <PERSON> Marler </PERSON> spent Friday night at the <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, where she was being treated for the concussion and a slight bruise to her forehead, said hospital spokeswoman <PERSON> Sherry </PERSON> <PERSON> Spatz </PERSON>. `` If everything is OK as we expect it to be, she'll be back'' for the pageant, <PERSON> Horn </PERSON> said. The bottle did not cut Miss <PERSON> Marler </PERSON>, said <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> police Detective Sgt. <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Rando </PERSON>, who was with her in the emergency room. `` She was very calm,'' he said. `` She was aware of everything that was going on, answering the doctors who were asking her questions.'' But later, Miss <PERSON> Marler </PERSON> became dizzy when doctors asked her to walk around the emergency room, Ms. <PERSON> Spatz </PERSON> said. If Miss <PERSON> Marler </PERSON> is able to compete tonight, doctors `` may, depending on her condition, ask her to refrain from wearing high heels,'' Ms. <PERSON> Spatz </PERSON> said. The incident occurred around 9 p.m. as the convertible Miss <PERSON> Marler </PERSON> was riding in passed <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Avenue </LOCATION>. Miss <PERSON> Marler </PERSON> told the doctors that she did not black out when struck by the bottle. Pageant officials delivered several large bouquets of flowers to Miss <PERSON> Marler </PERSON>'s room. Her mother spent the night with her in the hospital, <PERSON> Horn </PERSON> said. Miss <PERSON> Marler </PERSON> became a likely top-10 semi-finalist after winning a preliminary talent competition on Wednesday. She sang an audience-grabbing rendition of `` Since I Fell For You.'' A recent marketing graduate of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tulsa </ORGANIZATION>, she hopes someday to become a lawyer. <PERSON> Horn </PERSON> said the decision to switch the parade from Tuesday to Friday did not change the mood of the crowd, but he said he might reconsider the parade's future after the incident with <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Marler </PERSON>. In past years, some contestants have been injured in the parade by slipping or falling, but there has never been an incident as serious as the bottle-throwing, <PERSON> Horn </PERSON> said. Several thousand people turned out to watch the parade.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> NYNEX </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and its striking workers broke off contract talks early this morning after a day of on-again, off-again negotiations to end the six-week strike. `` Nothing was resolved, and no more negotiating sessions have been scheduled,'' said <PERSON> Adele </PERSON> <PERSON> Stacy </PERSON> of Local 2222 of the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brotherhood </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electrical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION>. Negotiators for the telephone company and the <ORGANIZATION> IBEW </ORGANIZATION> met intermittently Friday morning and afternoon, and union leaders said the company appeared to be pushing to reach a settlement by midnight. But the talks at <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>'s Park Plaza Hotel ended fruitlessly at 12:25 a.m. Earlier in the day, ebullient union leaders addressing 700 strikers at a rally outside <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> England </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>'s headquarters in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> said the six-week strike had been significantly strengthened by a <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> ruling that the workers would be entitled to unemployment benefits starting next week. <PERSON> Myles </PERSON> <PERSON> Calvey </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brotherhood </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electrical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Local </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> 2222 </ORGANIZATION>, estimated that unemployment payments for 12,000 <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> workers would cost the telephone company $ 9 million per week. <PERSON> Calvey </PERSON> and <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Early </PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>, said the ruling Wednesday by the state Division of Employment and training had caused the company to push for a rapid settlement. <ORGANIZATION> NYNEX </ORGANIZATION> reportedly made concessions on safety and insurance issues this week in its talks with the <ORGANIZATION> IBEW </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> CWA </ORGANIZATION>, which together represent 62,000 striking workers at <ORGANIZATION> NYNEX </ORGANIZATION> companies in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>. Workers walked out Aug. 6 after <ORGANIZATION> NYNEX </ORGANIZATION> asked them to start paying $ 10.27 a week toward health insurance. For nearly 20 years, the company had paid 100 percent of the insurance premiums. Job security, safety, wages and benefits are also on the bargaining table, but both sides have said health care is the key issue. `` It was our hope that -LRB- the strike -RRB- would have ended sooner,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Brien </PERSON>, spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> NYNEX </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` Our hope is that we'll find a way out of this. We know our workers want to come back to work.'' <ORGANIZATION> NYNEX </ORGANIZATION> is the only one of the nation's seven `` Baby Bell'' regional telephone operating companies that still has not reached a settlement with its workers. Employees of <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Telesis </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Ameritech </ORGANIZATION> struck last month but reached agreements. Beginning next week, the more than 40,000 <ORGANIZATION> NYNEX </ORGANIZATION> strikers in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> also will be eligible for unemployment compensation, said Early. Union leaders introduced a plan to help support 6,000 strikers in other <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> states who are not eligible for unemployment benefits.

<TEXT>
 Leftist rebels and the Salvadoran government have agreed to monthly peace talks aimed at ending nearly a decade of civil war. After negotiators announced the agreement in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> Friday, an estimated 10,000 Salvadorans marched in their capital in support of the plan. The guerrilla group, <ORGANIZATION> Farabundo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marti </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, said it hoped `` that 1990 will be the year of the war's final end.'' `` The blood that has been spilled in the longest and most costly conflict on the continent, all this blood that has been spilled, deserves this,'' rebel leader <PERSON> Shafick </PERSON> <PERSON> Handal </PERSON> said at a news conference in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. Since the fighting began in 1979, 70,000 Salvadorans have been killed. In <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, President <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON> called the agreement important but said: `` While welcoming the dialogue process, we do n't want to create false expectations. `` We want to reiterate that our attitude is one of openness and flexibility within our constitutional framework ... We know the road ahead is difficult and complex,'' he told an Independence Day rally. The rebels and the rightist government agreed to meet next in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jose </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rican </LOCATION> capital, on Oct. 16-17 and once a month thereafter. They agreed that two representatives from the <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> will mediate the talks and that they will also invite the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> States </ORGANIZATION> to send observers. The <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON> government initially opposed church mediation or outside observers. It had also proposed meeting the guerrillas every two months instead of once a month. The pact, reached after two days of talks, also stipulates that neither side can unilaterally withdraw from the negotiations and that each delegation will have authority to reach binding accords. The <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> talks were the first in two years between the government and rebels; they were also the first meeting between the guerrillas and <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON>'s administration. The rebels have already laid out their peace proposal. The government is to present its plan in October. The rebels are offering to lay down their arms and form a legal political party in exchange for sweeping social and political reforms. They dropped previous demands for power sharing and for merging the rebel and government armies. Most of the civil war's victims have been civilians. Human rights groups and international organizations say many were killed by right-wing death squads linked to the military and <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON>'s party, links the party denies <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> has provided more than $ 3.5 billion in military and economic aid to <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> this decade, making it <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s biggest single recipient of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> assistance For the first time since the civil war started in 1979, Salvadoran authorities staged an Independence Day military parade through their capital on Friday. About 3,000 troops from the three military branches and the three militarized police forces marched to music by military bands. Crowds lined the parade route, which followed a route different from that of the peace march. But the peace marchers appeared to attract more people, who waved white flags and blue-and-white national banners and chanted slogans hailing the peace talk agreement. The march was sponsored by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Debate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peace </ORGANIZATION>, an umbrella organization comprising about 70 church, union, student and humanitarian organizations.

 Hundreds of British bird spotters headed for the <LOCATION> Shetland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION> after their Birdline telephone information service reported the presence of a rare great knot wading bird. The bird spotters, nicknamed twitchers and armed with powerful binoculars, telescopes and expensive cameras, compete among themselves to log sightings of rare birds around <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. The great knot is an <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> bird measuring just over 10 inches in length. <PERSON> Birdline </PERSON> reported that one was seen Friday at a spot called the Pool of Virkie near <LOCATION> Sumburgh </LOCATION> airport on the southern tip of the remote <LOCATION> Shetland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION>, 100 miles off <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>. The British domestic news agency <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> reported that it was the first recorded sighting of a Great Knot in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and only the fourth for the whole of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. The news agency said previous European sightings were in <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> in 1979 and <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> in 1987. <PERSON> Birdline </PERSON> said the great knot is thought to have been blown off course by easterly winds while migrating from its breeding grounds 5,000 miles away in <LOCATION> northeast </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Siberia </LOCATION> to its winter range, mainly in southern <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>. Many bird watchers were expected to be frustrated in their bid to reach the <LOCATION> Shetland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION> by the weekend. One veteran twitcher, <PERSON> Ian </PERSON> <PERSON> Mills </PERSON>, from <LOCATION> Whitburn </LOCATION> in northeast <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, reported: `` The word has gone round that all flights to Shetland tomorrow -LRB- Saturday -RRB- are booked solid so it looks as if the majority of us will miss out this weekend. `` It's very frustrating that such a crowd-pulling bird should have turned up at such a hard-to-get-to place. `` This is one of those once-in-a-lifetime opportunities. If it had appeared on mainland <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, thousands of people would have been along to see it.''

 Environmentalists are awaiting Gov. <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON>'s decision on the resettlement of the neighborhood around the Love Canal toxic dump, saying his choice could set a national precedent. `` Love Canal is not a local <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> issue,'' said <PERSON> Penny </PERSON> <PERSON> Newman </PERSON> of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s Concerned Neighbors in Action. `` It will set a precedent for the rest of us who are living near these dump sites.'' <PERSON> Newman </PERSON> was one of about 200 protesters who gathered outside the state Capitol Friday night with hopes of persuading <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> to stop the resettlement. `` If the government can get away with resettling Love Canal _ one of the most notorious dump sites in the country _ then what do the rest of us have to expect?'' she said. `` Let us learn a lesson from Love Canal and not repeat our mistakes,'' said <PERSON> Lois </PERSON> <PERSON> Gibbs </PERSON>, the former Love Canal housewife who led the fight 11 years ago to get people removed from the area. The demonstrators sang, prayed, chanted and listened to speeches. One of the speakers was former resident <PERSON> Luella </PERSON> <PERSON> Kenny </PERSON>, whose 7-year-old son died of kidney disease. `` Next Tuesday ... there's young man that should've turned 18 years old ... that should've started college this year,'' said <PERSON> Kenny </PERSON>. `` He never had that opportunity because he lived in Love Canal. He played in his backyard with those chemicals.'' The protesters draped the fence of the Executive Mansion with red ribbon adorned with more than 5,000 letters to <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON>, urging him to stop the Love Canal resettlement, planned for next year. <ORGANIZATION> Occidental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, owner of the former <ORGANIZATION> Hooker </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Plastic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> which used Love Canal as a waste dump, acknowledges that 20,000 tons of chemicals were dumped there in the 1940s and 1950s. The dump was eventually closed and a school and playground were built above it. Hundreds of homes were built in a surrounding suburb, which President <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> declared a federal disaster area in 1978. Today, about 70 homes in Love Canal are occupied by people who chose not to flee with most of their neighbors in 1978. Much of the chemical contamination remains in a giant fenced-in mound at the center of the neighborhood. Last fall, Dr. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Axelrod </PERSON>, the state health commissioner, ruled that two-thirds of the 10-block Love Canal neighborhood was suitable for resettlement after years of work to contain or treat the toxic contamination from the dump site.

 A printing plant worker apparently started buying up the high-powered arsenal he used to kill seven co-workers at the same time he quit his job because of mental illness, authorities said. Police said <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wesbecker </PERSON> was armed with several semiautomatic weapons and hundreds of rounds of ammunition Thursday morning as he went from floor to floor at the <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gravure </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Wesbecker </PERSON>, 47, killed seven people and injured 13 before killing himself Three of the injured were in critical condition Friday night. The first funeral for a victim of the massacre was to be held today in <LOCATION> Louisville </LOCATION>. The victim, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wible </PERSON> <PERSON> Sr. </PERSON>, will be buried Monday in <LOCATION> Forreston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>. Police searched <PERSON> Wesbecker </PERSON>'s home Thursday night and found the Feb. 6 issue of Time magazine open to a detailed article on similar shootings across the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in the past two years, said Lt. <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Moody </PERSON>, police homicide commander Before he quit working, <PERSON> Wesbecker </PERSON> apparently owned only less powerful weapons. But on Aug. 26, 1988 _ less than three weeks after he quit _ <PERSON> Wesbecker </PERSON> purchased a semiautomatic 9mm pistol from <ORGANIZATION> Archery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Guns in <LOCATION> Louisville </LOCATION>. Police said he used that gun to kill himself. Two MAC-11 semiautomatic machine pistols were purchased last Feb. 10 _ four days after the <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> article came out _ at <LOCATION> Tilford </LOCATION>'s Gun Sales in <LOCATION> Louisville </LOCATION>. He bought an AK-47 assault rifle on May 1. Meanwhile, state Rep. <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Ward </PERSON>, D-Louisville, said he would sponsor a bill in the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> to ban assault weapons in <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>. `` We owe it to the families and the other victims to try at least to make it harder for a deranged person to obtain the weapon,'' <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> said. Nearly 90 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gravure </ORGANIZATION>'s 360 employees met with grief counselors when they returned to the plant Friday morning. Several hundred later attended a Mass at the Roman Catholic Cathedral of the Assumption. The plant's offices had been cleaned up overnight. Bullet holes in walls and ceilings were the only physical reminders of the tragedy. <PERSON> Wesbecker </PERSON> was a pressman at the plant from 1971 until he quit on Aug. 8, 1988. The company placed him on long-term disability last Feb. 2 because of his mental problems _ meaning he could never work at the plant again. Relatives told police that <PERSON> Wesbecker </PERSON> was a manic depressive who had attempted suicide three times. <PERSON> Wesbecker </PERSON> paid $ 349 for the AK-47 without revealing his mental problems on a federal form required for such purchases, said <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Tilford </PERSON>, owner of <PERSON> Tilford </PERSON>'s, and federal officials. About two weeks after he picked it up, <PERSON> Wesbecker </PERSON> returned and bought about a case of ammunition _ 1,100 rounds _ for $ 139, <PERSON> Tilford </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Tilford </PERSON> said <PERSON> Wesbecker </PERSON> answered all eight questions properly on a federal <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alcohol </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tobacco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Firearms </ORGANIZATION> gun purchase form. <ORGANIZATION> Moody </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Wesbecker </PERSON> had spent time _ voluntarily _ in mental institutions, including Our Lady of Peace in <LOCATION> Louisville </LOCATION>. Police would not reveal when he had been hospitalized.

 Two students at a rural high school that President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> visited early in his anti-drug campaign have been arrested on drug charges, officials said. A spokeswoman for the <ORGANIZATION> Lancaster </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Task </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> said Friday the students, both 17-year-old girls, were arrested Thursday at their homes and have been turned over to juvenile authorities. The students' names were not released because of their ages. One was charged with two counts of delivery and one count of possession with intent to deliver LSD, according to the spokeswoman, who spoke on condition of anonymity. The youth had 579 doses with a street value of $ 4 each. The second youth was charged with criminal conspiracy to deliver marijuana and had about a quarter pound of the drug, the spokeswoman said. The spokeswoman said the two were arrested as part of a two-month undercover operation. `` We just happened to be doing our investigation and -LRB- the youths -RRB- just became involved,'' she said. `` It did not center on the high school.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> spoke to about 3,000 students at <ORGANIZATION> Conestoga </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Valley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in March and stressed the threat drugs pose to rural areas. The youths were selling drugs to people throughout <LOCATION> Lancaster </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, known for its large population of Amish, mostly to users in their late teens or early 20s, the spokeswoman said.

 <PERSON> Mother </PERSON> <PERSON> Teresa </PERSON> was feeling better today after a persistent fever disappeared, said a Roman Catholic nun at the mission founded by the Nobel laureate in <LOCATION> Calcutta </LOCATION>'s slums. But doctors still were trying to find the cause of an infection that posed a new danger to <PERSON> Mother </PERSON> <PERSON> Teresa </PERSON>, 79, as she tried to recover from a heart attack, said the nun, who spoke on condition of anonymity. Nonetheless, the nun said, `` She is feeling much better today. The fever is gone and her temperature is normal.'' A statement issued by doctors at <LOCATION> Woodlands </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Nursing </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Home </LOCATION>, the hospital where she was admitted nearly two weeks ago, said <PERSON> Mother </PERSON> <PERSON> Teresa </PERSON>'s condition had improved and that she was responding to treatment and `` resting calmly.'' But Dr. <PERSON> Vincenzo </PERSON> <PERSON> Bilotta </PERSON>, a heart specialist from <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> and a longtime friend of <PERSON> Mother </PERSON> <PERSON> Teresa </PERSON>, said her condition remained serious. `` Her heart is very weak. The infection is now posing a new danger to her,'' said <PERSON> Bilotta </PERSON>, who treated <PERSON> Mother </PERSON> <PERSON> Teresa </PERSON> for a similar ailment in 1985. Dr. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Lombardi </PERSON>, an infectious disease specialist from <ORGANIZATION> Cornell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, said doctors were trying to find the cause. `` We are doing everything possible but could not yet diagnose it,'' he said. <PERSON> Lombardi </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bilotta </PERSON> flew to <LOCATION> Calcutta </LOCATION> earlier in the week to help with the treatment. <PERSON> Mother </PERSON> <PERSON> Teresa </PERSON> developed chest pains and a high fever Thursday just as doctors thought she was progressing well. She was admitted to the hospital Sept. 5 with an irregular heartbeat, a blocked artery and high fever. She suffered a heart attack three days later. `` We have hopes that she will recover and overcome this,'' said <PERSON> Bilotta </PERSON>, who planned to return to <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> this weekend. Born in <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Mother </PERSON> <PERSON> Teresa </PERSON> gave up a comfortable life as a convent teacher to live and work among the poor and dying in this eastern Indian city's filthy slums. She was awarded the 1979 Nobel Peace Prize for her work. She founded the <ORGANIZATION> Missionaries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Charity </ORGANIZATION> in October 1950 in an abandoned run-down hostel donated by the city. The order, which was formally recognized by the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> in 1965, expanded and now has 3,000 nuns working in 87 countries.

 A school bus with an allegedly drunken driver at the wheel flipped over a curb onto its side, slightly injuring 20 schoolchildren, police said. The bus carrying the 20 children home from school went out of control on the city's <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Side </LOCATION> on Friday, police said. Charges of driving under the influence and operating a school bus while intoxicated, a felony, were filed against the driver, <PERSON> Ocie </PERSON> <PERSON> Hendricks </PERSON>, 53, after he refused a breathalizer test, said <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> Police Sgt. <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Satala </PERSON>. <PERSON> Hendricks </PERSON>, being held at the district station until a bond hearing today, could be jailed for up to three years if convicted of the felony charge, <PERSON> Satala </PERSON> said. The children were treated for minor injuries at four area hospitals, said Fire Department spokesman <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Sheppard </PERSON>. Their age range was not immediately available, though the children at one of the hospital were ages 9 to 14. Witnesses at the scene said the bus was traveling 40 mph in a 15 mph zone, but that could not be immediately confirmed by police.

 A plane crash killed all six people aboard, including a man and his wife who had just been reunited after she was reported missing and then found wandering on a <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> beach. <PERSON> Belinda </PERSON> <PERSON> Yancey </PERSON>, 33, who police believe was abducted Monday, was traveling home with her husband, <PERSON> Charles </PERSON>, when the plane's wing struck a tree and crashed into a nearby open field at 9:20 p.m. CDT Friday, authorities said. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Yancey </PERSON> had traveled to <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> to bring back his wife. The twin-engine Beechcraft BE-10, which departed from <LOCATION> Orlando </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, was approaching the runway at the <LOCATION> Mayfield-Graves </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> airport near this southwestern <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> community in the fog. A state police dispatcher said the weather may have caused the crash. `` This is a real nasty night,'' she said, declining to be identified. Family members had been relieved by the discovery of Ms. <PERSON> Yancey </PERSON>. When she was located on Thursday afternoon, <PERSON> Mayfield </PERSON> police Capt. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Crawford </PERSON> said, `` We're thankful that she is unharmed. She is safe and I know the family feels their prayers have been answered.'' Ms. <PERSON> Yancey </PERSON>, who taught the hearing impaired at <ORGANIZATION> Mayfield </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, was found when she wandered up to a lifeguard on a beach at <LOCATION> Daytona </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, and reported that she was lost, authorities said. She was disoriented and did n't know her name, said Sgt. <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON> <PERSON> Rountree </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> Volusia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Rangers </ORGANIZATION>. Mrs. <PERSON> Yancey </PERSON> finally remembered her name and hometown after talking to <PERSON> Rountree </PERSON> for about two hours, he said. Based on statements she made to <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> authorities, Ms. <PERSON> Yancey </PERSON> may have been drugged with Valium by her abductor, who remained at large, <PERSON> Crawford </PERSON> said. Ms. <PERSON> Yancey </PERSON> told authorities that `` they kept giving me little blue pills,'' <PERSON> Crawford </PERSON> said. In interviews with authorities and relatives, she could not recall how she got to <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> and was unable to identify who drove her there, <PERSON> Crawford </PERSON> said. Ms. <PERSON> Yancey </PERSON>'s hair had been cut and dyed and she had bruises on her arms, indicating she may have been tied up or restrained, he said. Ms. <PERSON> Yancey </PERSON> had been last seen around 2:30 p.m. Monday, when she told her son that she was going to <ORGANIZATION> Murray </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>'s bookstore She left in an automobile that has not been found and was reported stolen, <PERSON> Crawford </PERSON> said. The other victims were identified as pilot <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Haag </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>; and <PERSON> Mayfield </PERSON> residents <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanders </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Melissa </PERSON>; and the Rev. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON>.

The plane, a 1970 model, was owned by <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Orlando </LOCATION>, formerly of the <LOCATION> Mayfield </LOCATION> area and a cousin of Ms. <PERSON> Yancey </PERSON>. Federal investigators were expected to arrive at the crash site today.

 Investigators suspect that a blowtorch probably caused an explosion that killed 10 miners, but the probe has been delayed while dangerous levels of methane are cleared from the mine, authorities said. State inspectors found the blowtorch Friday near the site of Wednesday's explosion, which officials believe to have been fueled by methane gas, said <PERSON> Willard </PERSON> <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON>, commissioner of the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Minerals </ORGANIZATION>. Workers may have been using the torch to disassemble a longwall mining, investigators said. Officials of the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Mine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> approved a modified company plan to reduce the methane levels at the <LOCATION> William </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Station </LOCATION> mine that delayed the investigation Friday, said administration spokeswoman <PERSON> Kathy </PERSON> <PERSON> Snyder </PERSON>. <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> said one of the mine's curtains _ used to channel outside air to mining areas to carry away methane gas _ appeared to be dislodged. <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> said he did n't know if the curtain was moved out of place before the blast, by the explosion itself or during rescue operations. On Friday night, hours after the first burial of the mine disaster, scores of area residents gathered for a memorial service at <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>. `` In <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>, our families are strong. Our communities are supportive, and our courage is abundant,'' Gov. <PERSON> Wallace </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilkinson </PERSON> told the crowd, which packed the 700-seat auditorium. `` The events are irreversible. `` We can only share in the immense grief.'' A funeral service was held earlier for 31-year-old <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Hedges </PERSON>. The other burials were scheduled for today and Sunday. Also Friday, the head of a public-interest law firm said the mine owner, <ORGANIZATION> Pyro </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mining </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, and federal officials had failed to prevent the disaster despite abundant warning signs. He said the government had been too lenient with the mine owners. `` There's strong evidence that there was knowledge on the part of both company and the government that there was a methane problem at the mine, coupled with a ventilation problem,'' said <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Davitt </PERSON> <PERSON> McAteer </PERSON>, executive director of the Washington-based Occupational Safety and <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>. Federal inspectors briefly shut down the mine seven times this year because of imminent dangers, <PERSON> McAteer </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Pyro </PERSON> had reported 267 accidents at the mine since 1985 but failed to report several others, said <PERSON> McAteer </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> MSHA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Gorman </PERSON> angrily denied <PERSON> McAteer </PERSON>'s claim that his agency had not properly policed Pyro. The agency imposed many penalties on the company, <PERSON> O'Gorman </PERSON> said. Company spokesman <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Calman </PERSON> refused to discuss <PERSON> Pyro </PERSON>'s safety record, but denied criticism from area residents that <PERSON> Pyro </PERSON> was withholding information about the accident. `` This company is not hiding anything,'' <PERSON> Calman </PERSON> said.

 Monsoon rains loosened earth in a quarry in a <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> suburb, triggering a landslide today that buried more than a dozen houses in a nearby squatter colony. At least 14 people were killed, officials said. <PERSON> Zenaida </PERSON> <PERSON> Santa </PERSON> <PERSON> Ana </PERSON>, head social worker of the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Welfare </ORGANIZATION> and Development for the <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> area, said the landslide occurred at 6:00 a.m. in the village of <LOCATION> Tunasan </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Muntinglupa </LOCATION>, just south of the capital. Ms. <PERSON> Santa </PERSON> <PERSON> Ana </PERSON> said soldiers, police officers and civilian volunteers dug up 14 bodies under the tons of mud, rock and debris. Seven of the eight people found alive were in serious condition, she said. The landslide destroyed at least 14 shanties. Ms. <PERSON> Santa </PERSON> <PERSON> Ana </PERSON> said 68 families living near the quarry were evacuated to a nearby chapel because of fears that additional rain may trigger another landslide. Ten hours after the incident, rescuers still were searching for one male resident of the area, she said. She said the rescue had been slow because the area is an interior village and is not accessible to large digging equipment. Most rescuers were using using their hands, picks, shovels and pails.

 Gov. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Deukmejian </PERSON> enacted one of the strictest drunken driving laws in the country, lowering the blood alcohol level at which a person is presumed too drunk to drive to 0.08 percent. The bill, lowering the unacceptable blood alcohol level from 0.10 percent, will take effect next Jan. 1. Only three other states _ <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> _ have as tough a standard. `` This is a very strong signal and message to individuals who do drink and do drive that it is more likely that they will wind up being convicted of drunken driving, and hopefully this will be a very strong incentive to prevent them from doing so,'' <PERSON> Deukmejian </PERSON> told an audience of news reporters and uniformed law enforcement officers at a signing ceremony Friday in his office. He said drunken driving deaths had decreased on <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> highways in recent years, but were still too high to accept. `` I am convinced we are going to save lives under this bill,'' said <PERSON> Assemblyman </PERSON> <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON>, author of the new law. `` I do n't want anyone arrested under this bill. I want people who drink to stay off the road. It's a health problem. It's a criminal problem.'' Although each individual's blood alcohol level is affected by a variety of factors, such as weight, the average person can consume about three glasses of beer or comparable amounts of other alcholic beverages in an hour before reaching the 0.08 percent level.

 Former <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> board members testified in <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>'s fraud trial that they did n't know the company was struggling to pay its bills when they approved of big bonuses for the evangelist and his wife. Prosecutors accuse <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> of diverting more than $ 3.7 million in <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> money to fund his lavish lifestyle. If found guilty of the 24 counts against him, <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> could be sentenced to 120 years in prison and fined more than $ 5 million. <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Tammy </PERSON> <PERSON> Faye </PERSON>, received more than $ 3 million in bonuses from the ministry in the mid-1980s, according to evidence presented in the trial. The bonuses often came during periods of financial trouble for the ministry, witnesses have testified. Board members testified Friday they were kept in the dark about the financial condition of the ministry. <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> and his former deputy <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Dortch </PERSON> are accused of concealing <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION>'s deteriorating finances from the <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> directors. The Rev. <PERSON> Evelyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Spencer </PERSON>, a board member from <LOCATION> Oakland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, said she trusted <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> to inform board members of the ministry's finances `` I just trusted him, period,'' she said. <PERSON> Aimme </PERSON> <PERSON> Cortese </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> minister and <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> board member testified that she never would have voted for the bonuses had she known about <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION>'s financial condition. `` It did n't make sense,'' she said. `` How could you give away bonuses while you were floating -LRB- checks -RRB-?'' A former <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> payroll clerk testified that 265 ministry workers were laid off in November 1985, a month during which the <ORGANIZATION> Bakkers </ORGANIZATION> received $ 300,000 in bonuses. <PERSON> Joanie </PERSON> <PERSON> Ames </PERSON>, a single mother of two, said she called her children together and said, `` I'm sorry to tell you this, but we wo n't have Christmas until after because the check wo n't be here.''' The prosecution has said that <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> received a $ 200,000 bonus on Nov. 12, 1985, and Mrs. <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> got a $ 100,000 bonus. Less than a year later, on Nov. 3, 1986, the <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> board approved a $ 500,000 bonus for <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>. Also Friday, a former <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> attorney testified that he advised <PERSON> Dortch </PERSON> that the ministry should fight <PERSON> Jessica </PERSON> <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON>'s threatened lawsuit over a sexual encounter she had with <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> attorney <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Furstman </PERSON> testified that he considered <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON>'s threatened suit frivolous. But <PERSON> Dortch </PERSON> decided to pay <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON> $ 265,000 because he feared disclosure of the 1980 encounter, <PERSON> Furstman </PERSON> said. A deal finally struck between <PERSON> Dortch </PERSON> and Ms. <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON> included a $ 115,000 payment to Ms. <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON>, and $ 150,000 put into a trust account for her. The trust was never set up, but the money was deposited in a money market account. The trust fund money eventually was returned to the trustee in <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION>'s bankruptcy proceedings in July 1988. The federal charges against <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> cite the Ms. <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON> payoff money as an example of how he allegedly used PTL money for his personal benefit.

<TEXT>
 The judge in <PERSON> Zsa </PERSON> <PERSON> Zsa </PERSON> <PERSON> Gabor </PERSON>'s cop-slapping trial ordered the outspoken celebrity to quit talking to the news media in defiance of a gag order `` I will make a warning, but this will be the first and last time I say this,'' Municipal Court Judge <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Rubin </PERSON> told Miss <PERSON> Gabor </PERSON> on Friday. `` You are to say to the press, ` No comment.''' The judge's warning, after a contempt of court request from a prosecutor, was based on earlier statements by Miss <PERSON> Gabor </PERSON>. <PERSON> Rubin </PERSON> apparently was unaware of Miss <PERSON> Gabor </PERSON>'s catty remarks a few moments before in the corridor outside court, in which she blasted <LOCATION> Beverly </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION> Police Officer <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Kramer </PERSON>, the motorcycle cop who arrested her. The former Hungarian beauty queen told reporters she should have scratched <PERSON> Kramer </PERSON>'s eyes out. `` I think that cop is not too bright,'' Miss <PERSON> Gabor </PERSON> said. `` I think he must be very spoiled because he's very sexy. He's gorgeous. He's sexy, but I do n't like that man.'' Miss <PERSON> Gabor </PERSON>'s diatribe had begun at the curb, where she alighted from her <ORGANIZATION> Rolls-Royce </ORGANIZATION> in a black-and-white <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> <PERSON> Klein </PERSON> trouser outfit and a furious mood. `` This man is the biggest liar and the Police Department is the biggest liar in the world,'' Miss <PERSON> Gabor </PERSON> said, ignoring pleas from her attorney reminding her of the gag order. After <PERSON> Rubin </PERSON>'s warning, defense attorney <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Graysen </PERSON> complained about a television interview with another <LOCATION> Beverly </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION> police officer who called Miss <PERSON> Gabor </PERSON> a `` foul-mouthed, cheap lawbreaker.'' Miss <PERSON> Gabor </PERSON> remained closemouthed during the proceedings and passed time sketching a portrait of the bailiff and displayed it to reporters in the court during a brief bench conference. Miss <PERSON> Gabor </PERSON>, who says the doodling `` calms my nerves,'' previously drew pictures of the judge, the clerk and the court reporter. <PERSON> Kramer </PERSON> pulled her over on June 14 for having expired registration tags on her <ORGANIZATION> Rolls-Royce </ORGANIZATION>. As he checked for other violations, Miss <PERSON> Gabor </PERSON> allegedly drove off, was stopped again, and allegedly slapped <PERSON> Kramer </PERSON>'s face. She is charged with misdemeanor battery on a police officer, disobeying an officer's orders, driving with an expired license and car registration, and having an open container of alcohol in her car. <PERSON> Kramer </PERSON>, who testified on Thursday that Miss <PERSON> Gabor </PERSON> cursed, spit and slapped him, left the stand in the morning after cross-examination by the defense. <PERSON> Kramer </PERSON> was asked if he had worn a `` Free Zsa Zsa'' T-shirt at his recent 38th birthday party and <PERSON> Kramer </PERSON> said he had. Asked if it got hot under his helmet, <PERSON> Kramer </PERSON> said it did. `` Does it ever fry your brain?'' <PERSON> Graysen </PERSON> asked, getting a `` no comment'' from the officer and an objection from the prosecutor. It was sustained.

<HEAD>East Germany Sticks To Hard Line Despite Acknowledging Brain Drain</HEAD>

<DATELINE>FRANKFURT, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s hard-line leadership acknowledged that the exodus of skilled workers to the West will hurt the economy but rejected calls for reform that would encourage citizens to stay. Hundreds more refugees arrived in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> today, confounding expectations that the stream of people would slow to a trickle after the initial wave earlier this week. Officials said Friday that about 14,000 refugees had arrived since midnight Sunday, when <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> decided to empty its crowded refugee camps by opening its border with <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION> and allowing the East Germans to leave without their government's permission. <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> coordinated the exodus with <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, where East Germans automatically gain citizenship. Communist East <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> bitterly denounced its <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pact </ORGANIZATION> ally and demanded that <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> close its border. <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, however, said that allowing East Germans passage to the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> was in line with social and political reforms it is carrying out. <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> began dismantling its border barriers with <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION> in May and 10,000 East Germans escaped illegally prior to this week's crossings West German counterintelligence officials said Friday they were worried that <LOCATION> Communist </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> may have slipped a few spies among the refugees. They promised help to any spies who turned themselves in. A surge of crossings Thursday followed news reports that <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> would soon close the border. But comments by Hungarian officials Friday appeared calculated to dispel such fears. Government spokesman <PERSON> Zsolt </PERSON> <PERSON> Bajnok </PERSON> said there had been no decision on when the border would be closed. Most of the refugees are young, educated and skilled people, and they have left a gaping hole in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s work force. East German <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> member <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Tisch </PERSON> said Friday the goverment will have to find solutions `` to bridge this gap.'' `` It certainly wo n't be easy,'' <PERSON> Tisch </PERSON> said during a visit to <LOCATION> Stuttgart </LOCATION>. `` Naturally, it's not unproblematical for us that skilled workers, whether young or old, from the <LOCATION> German </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Democratic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> are resettling in the Federal Republic of <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>.'' According to statistics released Thursday by the West German government, <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> is suffering its biggest talent drain from the nation's work force since the <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> Wall went up in 1961. Several times in the past few days, West German Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> has urged the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> German </LOCATION> leadership to make political and economic reforms to curb the flow of refugees. But <PERSON> Guenter </PERSON> <PERSON> Mittag </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> member in charge of the East German economy, rejected those calls in a commentary Friday in the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> daily newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Neues </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deutschland </ORGANIZATION>. `` The reform proposals of those people contain only one point: They want the type of reform that does away with Socialism,'' <PERSON> Mittag </PERSON> wrote. `` Thanks a lot for that. It just wo n't be that way!'' In <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> said 60 East Germans demanding to emigrate were holed up at the West German Embassy in <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, and 170 at the embassy in <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>. There was little hope they would gain passage to the West, however. Polish leaders have urged caution in the matter, and <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> has refused to sanction their departure.

<HEAD>Waste Agreement Reached; Nuclear Weapons Plant Remains Open</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEVEN K. PAULSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The Rocky Flats nuclear weapons plant will remain open over the weekend after federal officials reached a tentative agreement on handling the plant's wastes, a federal official said. Negotiators for the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION>, which owns the plant, and <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, reached agreement on the thorny issue Friday, said the official, who spoke only on condition that he not be identified further. Plant operator <ORGANIZATION> Rockwell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> had set a Friday deadline for the <ORGANIZATION> DOE </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> to resolve conflicting regulations concerning radioactive, hazardous and mixed wastes at the plant. Sources had said the plant could have closed as early as 5:30 p.m. Friday if the demands were n't met. DOE officials had threatened in July to close the plant due to a fear they could face criminal charges over ongoing environmental violations stemming from the wastes, for which there is no federally approved disposal site. The plant, which is 16 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> and employs about 6,000 people, is the only one in the country that makes plutonium triggers for nuclear weapons, and federal officials have warned that a shutdown could endanger <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> defense. The source said the agreement calls for mixed waste to be stored `` in an environmentally sound manner,'' for DOE to launch a program to reduce the amount of waste being generated at Rocky Flats, and for the agency to do everything possible to improve its capacity for treating the waste. The source said the agreement reached by negotiators still must be signed by top agency officials. The state of <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> also reportedly gave approval to the agreement, but <PERSON> Rockwell </PERSON> thus far is not a party, the source said. `` This in no way is a grant of immunity for any past violations,'' the source said, apparently referring to an investigation under way into alleged illegal disposal of wastes and of a possible coverup. <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> investigators raided Rocky Flats on June 6, and a special federal grand jury is reviewing the case. <PERSON> Cathy </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaliniak </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> DOE </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, said the agency would have no announcement until Monday and <ORGANIZATION> Rocky </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Flats </ORGANIZATION> would remain open until at least that time. She said talks were continuing, but declined to discuss details. `` Rocky Flats is continuing to operate as normal,'' said <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Hurtt </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Rockwell </ORGANIZATION> spokesman. <PERSON> Rockwell </PERSON> later issued a statement that said its officials met with representatives of the <ORGANIZATION> DOE </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> to discuss the issue. `` <ORGANIZATION> Rockwell </ORGANIZATION> finds itself in a position where one agency of the federal government -LRB- EPA -RRB- says it may take legal action against our people at <ORGANIZATION> Rocky </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Flats </ORGANIZATION> and against the corporation -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Rockwell </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- for actions that we are required to perform under contract with another agency -LRB- DOE -RRB-,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Rockwell </ORGANIZATION> statement said.

 Authorities arrested two men and began a manhunt for a right-wing former presidential candidate suspected in violence blamed for at least 34 deaths and the disappearances of seven students. <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Guillermo </PERSON> <PERSON> Mollinedo </PERSON> said at a news conference Friday that <PERSON> Leonel </PERSON> <PERSON> Sisniega </PERSON> <PERSON> Otero </PERSON>, who ran for president in 1982, was behind the terrorist violence. He said <PERSON> Sisniega </PERSON>, 64, was `` directing'' the violence but did not elaborate. Police found five grenades, two AR-15 rifles and other evidence at <PERSON> Sisniega </PERSON>'s home linking him to the attacks, <PERSON> Mollinedo </PERSON> said. Authorities did not say what motive Sisniega or the other suspects would have for participating in the violent incidents, which began nearly two months ago. Police told reporters that <PERSON> Maximiliano </PERSON> <PERSON> Archila </PERSON> <PERSON> Pellecer </PERSON>, 44, and lawyer <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Roberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> <PERSON> Pena </PERSON>, 46, were captured Thursday. `` They confessed that <PERSON> Sisniega </PERSON> <PERSON> Otero </PERSON> was the one directing the operations,'' <PERSON> Mollinedo </PERSON> said. Authorities said <PERSON> Archila </PERSON> was the first captured, and told about <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON>. Police said they found more grenades <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON>'s car when they apprehended him. Thirty-four people have died in terrorist violence since July 19. Three students and one professor at <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carlos </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> were found dead from multiple gunshot wounds last Sunday after being abducted. Three shoe repairmen were found dead Monday, also from gunshot wounds, and their right hands had been severed. Dozens of bombings in <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> have killed two people and injured dozens of others. A political leader and influential businessmen were assassinated. Over the past few days, 23 other people have been killed in various incidents. Seven students are missing and presumed kidnapped. Until Friday, authorities said they had no suspects or motives in the cases. Earlier in the week, President <PERSON> Vinicio </PERSON> <PERSON> Cerezo </PERSON> blamed unidentified right-wing and left-wing `` extremists'' for the violence and promised to use all the government's resources to stop the terrorism.

 A woman, whose pain from napalm bomb burns became a lasting image of the Vietnam War, has indefinitely postponed a trip to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> due to health reasons. <PERSON> Phan </PERSON> <PERSON> Thi </PERSON> <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Phuc </PERSON> decided to put off the trip she had planned this month, said <PERSON> Merle </PERSON> <PERSON> Ratner </PERSON>, co-director of the <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> to Welcome <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Phuc </PERSON>. A black-and-white photograph of 9-year-old <PERSON> Kim </PERSON>, screaming with agony as she ran nude down a Vietnamese road following an air raid in 1972, was published throughout the world and was awarded a Pulitzer Prize. `` Everybody remembers it,'' Ms. <PERSON> Ratner </PERSON> said Friday in a telephone interview from her office in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` It was the one enduring image from the war.'' What is not apparent in the photo, said <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> Photographer <PERSON> Nick </PERSON> <PERSON> Ut </PERSON>, who took the picture, is that the girl's back, neck and arm were charred `` like barbecue.'' Ut, who fled <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> in 1975 and continues to work for the <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, was reunited with <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Havana </LOCATION> in July, the first time they had been together since <ORGANIZATION> Ut </ORGANIZATION> took her to a hospital that fateful day. `` I would like to see her here,'' <ORGANIZATION> Ut </ORGANIZATION> said. `` But now I think the Vietnamese government does n't want her to come here. I wish she would come here soon.'' <PERSON> Kim </PERSON>, 26, developed diabetes while studying pharmacology in <LOCATION> Havana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>, and has had so much difficulty with her eyesight and ability to concentrate that she decided to change her course of studies to English, Ms. <PERSON> Ratner </PERSON> said. `` If she came here, she'd have to put off her studies in English, which begin in the fall,'' Ms. <PERSON> Ratner </PERSON> said. The trip probably has been postponed for a year or more, she said. <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s communist government already had approved <PERSON> Kim </PERSON>'s trip to <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and played no part in influencing her decision, Ms. <PERSON> Ratner </PERSON> said. `` They were very interested in having her make it,'' she said. `` No one wanted her to jeopardize her health.'' <ORGANIZATION> Ut </ORGANIZATION>'s prize-winning picture was the reason Ms. <PERSON> Ratner </PERSON> and others organized <PERSON> Kim </PERSON>'s trip. The ad hoc <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> to Welcome <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Phuc </PERSON> was formed `` specifically to bring her here as a gesture of friendship and reconciliation,'' Ms. <PERSON> Ratner </PERSON> said. `` She's a good representative,'' Ms. <PERSON> Ratner </PERSON> said. `` She's articulate She's not a -LRB- Communist -RRB- Party member. She's a young peasant woman who happened to have become famous because of her misfortune. And people want to meet her.'' Last month, Ms. <PERSON> Ratner </PERSON> said she spent two days with <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Havana </LOCATION>, where the Vietnamese woman has been studying for the past three years or so. `` She was in good spirits,'' Ms. <PERSON> Ratner </PERSON> said. `` She was disappointed she would have to postpone the trip, of course. ... You could tell she had trouble concentrating.''

 More than a dozen armed plainclothes officers broke into a law office and arrested the owner of an opposition newspaper shut down two years ago, one of his lawyers said. About 15 men shattered a glass door and apprehended <PERSON> Jaime </PERSON> <PERSON> Padilla </PERSON> <PERSON> Beliz </PERSON> on Friday, said <PERSON> Venus </PERSON> <PERSON> Cardenas </PERSON> of the firm <ORGANIZATION> Padilla </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> y </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Asociados </ORGANIZATION> where <PERSON> Padilla </PERSON> is a senior partner. She said they took him away in one of the three cars they used. Ms. <PERSON> Cardenas </PERSON> said that when she called the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> security office, a spokesman told her `` we know nothing'' about it. <PERSON> Padilla </PERSON>'s newspaper, <PERSON> El </PERSON> <PERSON> Siglo </PERSON>, an outspoken critic of Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, was closed in July 1987 by the Noriega-controlled government after being accused of undermining the physical and economic security of the state. Virtually all opposition newspapers have been closed. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, as commander of the Panamanian Defense Forces, is the most powerful man in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. In February 1988, federal grand juries in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> indicted him on charges of drug trafficking and money laundering, charges he denies. Economic sanctions and other pressure by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to remove <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> from power have since failed. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> had the government annul presidential elections May 7, which international observers said were won overwhelmingly by opposition candidate <PERSON> Guillermo </PERSON> <PERSON> Endara </PERSON>. In a statement Friday, <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> leaders said a provisional government that <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> recently installed was legally unjustified. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> on Sept. 1 named <PERSON> Francisco </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON>, 50, head of a provisional government. <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> said he wo n't call for new balloting until <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> lifts its sanctions on <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. The opposition insists its May 7 election victory be honored. `` Far from being solved, the crisis is getting worse,'' the church episcopate said. `` Contrary to all national and international expectations, we have a de facto government which is outside the constitutional framework. `` The only thing that would justify a government that calls itself provisional would be the immediate and direct search for constitutional order according to popular will.''

<HEAD>Arab League Committee Calls For Immediate Cease-Fire</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JIDDAH, Saudi Arabia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A three-man peacemaking committee called for an `` immediate and comprehensive'' cease-fire in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> today as a first step in a settlement of the 14-year-old civil war. In a communique issued in <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Morocco </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION>, whose foreign ministers make up the committee, the three countries said that `` there can be no solution to the <LOCATION> Lebanese </LOCATION> crisis by military means.'' The cease-fire call was meant to `` spare the bloodletting, and to spread security and stability and provide the propitious atmosphere for national reconciliation.'' The cease-fire demand was the first point in a seven-point peace plan contained in the communique. A Lebanese security body to be headed by <PERSON> Lakhdar </PERSON> <PERSON> Ibrahimi </PERSON>, an Algerian who is the committee's delegate to <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, would supervise the implementation of the cease-fire, the committee said. It would also supervise ships `` when information is received by the committee that they are carrying arms and ammunition to any party.'' As soon as the security body began its work, the naval blockade would be lifted and <ORGANIZATION> Beirut </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airport </ORGANIZATION> reopened, the communique said. It asked all the belligerents in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> to `` immediately cease the use of arms by all means, whichever the party.'' It called on all concerned states, and those who supported the committee in its task, `` to work by all means to halt the flow of arms to any one in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>.'' The committee invited the members of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> to meet to prepare and discuss a `` charter for national reconciliation'' on Sept. 30 after the cease-fire has been stabilized, the naval blockade lifted and the airport reopened. The venue of the meeting would be declared after consultations by <PERSON> Ibrahimi </PERSON>, the communique said. Ibrahimi would be heading to <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> on Sunday to put the decisions into effect, the communique added.

<HEAD>Assailant Firing From Jordan Injures Two Israeli Soldiers</HEAD>

 An assailant opened fire on an Israeli army patrol today from the Jordanian side of the border and slightly wounded two <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers, the military said. It said the soldiers came under fire near the settlement of <PERSON> Ashdot </PERSON> <PERSON> Yakov </PERSON> at about 4 a.m. <PERSON> Ashdot </PERSON> <PERSON> Yakov </PERSON> is three miles south of the Sea of <LOCATION> Galilee </LOCATION>. It was the second such attack in two weeks. An army spokeswoman said the assailant, who apparently acted alone, fired from the eastern side of the Israeli security fence, or from the Jordanian territory, and did not cross the border. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio said the assailant apparently was a <LOCATION> Jordanian </LOCATION> army soldier who abandoned his position, ran to the border and ambushed the Israeli patrol, managing to fire about 30 rounds while hiding behind a bush. The Israeli patrol returned fire and conducted searches, during which six cartridge clips from a U.S.-made M-16 assault rifle were found near the border, the military command said. The radio said the attack took place close to a Jordanian army position and that an army combat jacket was found near the site of the attack. One of the injured <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers was evacuated to <LOCATION> Rambam </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> in the port city of <LOCATION> Haifa </LOCATION>, the army command said. The other soldier was treated at a nearby army clinic, the army command said. Both reportedly suffered shrapnel wounds. An <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio reporter who was at the site of the attack said the Jordanians appeared to be `` in a lot of confusion, maybe even panic. In the beginning, you simply saw them running here and there without knowing what to do.'' He said a Jordanian search party was organized two hours after the attack. It was the sixth attack this year on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> from along the <LOCATION> Jordan-Israel </LOCATION> border. The most recent attack occurred Sept. 7, when several Soviet-designed Katyusha rockets were fired from <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> into <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. There were no injuries. Following that attack, <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> `` must work to prevent such acts ... as they are responsible for the acts.'' Foreign Minister <PERSON> Moshe </PERSON> <PERSON> Arens </PERSON>, also speaking after the incident, said `` the <LOCATION> Jordanian </LOCATION> government is responsible for every terrorist act originating on the <LOCATION> Jordanian </LOCATION> territory. We are asking the government of <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> to take action ... to prevent such acts in the future.''

 An <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> committee today called for an immediate cease-fire in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> as a first step toward ending the nation's 14-year-old civil war. Earlier, shelling reportedly killed 12 people and wounded 72. `` There can be no solution to the <LOCATION> Lebanese </LOCATION> crisis by military means,'' the foreign ministers of <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Morocco </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION>, who make up the committee, said in a communique released in those countries. <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> radio stations interrupted programming to broadcast reports of the cease-fire call. There was no immediate comment from <LOCATION> Lebanese </LOCATION> leaders. The committee, appointed by the <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> in May to find a solution to <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s crisis, called for an `` immediate and comprehensive'' cease-fire. Previous similar calls have failed to end the violence pitting Syrian troops and allied Moslem militias against the mainly Christian troops of army Gen. <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>. Fierce overnight shelling by Syrian and <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> gunners blew gaping holes in apartment buildings in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>'s Moslem and <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> sectors. Police reported 12 people were killed and 72 wounded, bringing the casualties to 914 killed and 2,685 wounded since the clashes broke out March 8. The thuds of explosions accompanied by the whooshing sound of rockets echoed across ravaged <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, and fires caused by the shelling blazed out of control through the night. Each side blamed the other for the escalation in fighting. A spokesman for <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s command, who refused to be further identified, said the Syrians `` provoked the barrage Friday evening. It seems they know that the committee's decision will condemn them again.'' The newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Ash-Sharq </ORGANIZATION>, which is close to the Syrian government of President <PERSON> Hafez </PERSON> <PERSON> Assad </PERSON>, blamed <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>, charging that the <ORGANIZATION> Maronite </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> general `` wants to foil Arab efforts.'' By 7:30 a.m., the ferocious shelling subsided into intermittent exchanges of mortar rounds across the traditional front lines in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, the wooded mountains southeast of the capital and the eastern mountain range. `` Do n't be pessimistic. The coming few hours will bring good news'' from the <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> committee, the <ORGANIZATION> Moslem </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Voice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nation </ORGANIZATION> radio repeatedly told listeners early in the day. The pro-Syrian leftist daily paper As-Safir said the overnight shelling duel, which at its peak reached 42 shells per minute, was `` the storm that preceded the quiet.'' The independent newspaper An-Nahar referred to the barrage as `` the last showdown'' and said the <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> committee would issue a `` binding cease-fire call.'' The committee, which met Wednesday and Thursday, said in its communique that a <LOCATION> Lebanese </LOCATION> security body to be headed by <PERSON> Lakhdar </PERSON> <PERSON> Ibrahimi </PERSON>, an Algerian who is the committee's delegate to <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, would supervise the implementation of the cease-fire. This body also would supervise ships `` when information is received by the committee that they are carrying arms and ammunition to any party,'' the committee said. As soon as the security body begins its work, blockades on ports should be lifted and <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>'s airport should reopen, the committee said. It called on all concerned states and those who supported the committee in its task `` to work by all means to halt the flow of arms to any one in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>.'' The committee invited the members of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> to meet to prepare and discuss a `` charter for national reconciliation'' on Sept. 30. The committee tried to arrange a settlement once before but announced July 31 that it had failed, and it blamed <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>'s refusal to withdraw from <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> has 40,000 troops in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> under a 1976 Arab League mandate to quell the civil war. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> charges the Syrians violated that mandate by siding with the Moslems and has vowed to fight until the Syrian troops leave. The latest round of fighting broke out in March after <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> blockaded ports run by Syrian-allied militias. <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> responded by shelling the Christian enclave north of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, home to about 1 million Christians. Syrian gunners also have shelled a 28-mile stretch of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> coast controlled by Christian forces north of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> to prevent <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> from receiving shipments of weapons and ammunition sent by <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>'s main Arab foe

 Senior leader <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaoping </PERSON> today appeared in public for the first time in more than three months, looking tanned and vigorous as he met an American professor at the Great Hall of the People. <PERSON> Deng </PERSON>'s 70-minute meeting with T.D. <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>, a Nobel prize-winning physicist from <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, was his first public appearance since June 9, five days after the bloody military attack on pro-democracy students and their supporters in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. Hundreds, and perhaps thousands, of people died as troops shot their way into the city en route to seizing <LOCATION> Tiananmen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION> from student demonstrators. Since then, Chinese and foreign sources have reported <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> is seriously ill with prostate cancer and may not have long to live. Chinese officials have said <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> is in good health and spent part of the summer resting at the seaside resort of <LOCATION> Beidaihe </LOCATION>. Speculation that <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> was no longer capable of carrying out his official functions rose when he failed to meet the president of the African state of <PERSON> Burkina </PERSON> <PERSON> Faso </PERSON> during a recent visit. The 85-year-old party patriarch, in remarks audible in an evening news report on the meeting, said he sometimes swims for up to one hour. `` I do n't like indoor swimming pools, but enjoy swimming in nature,'' he told the professor. The TV report showed the smiling <PERSON> Deng </PERSON>, wearing a gray <PERSON> Mao </PERSON> suit, grasp <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>'s hand with both of his and then walk steadily hand-in-hand with the American. He was also shown in animated conversation, gesturing and laughing. `` The recent turmoil has taught us a major lesson,'' <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> was quoted as saying by the television news and by the official <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>. `` Some of our comrades just immersed themselves in their specific work, did not pay enough attention to ideological and political developments, were not vigilant enough against the serious corruption, and the measures taken to correct it proved less than effective.'' <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> was apparently referring to ousted <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> <PERSON> Ziyang </PERSON>, who has been accused of abetting the pro-democracy demonstrators and splitting the party. <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> stressed that <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> will not change the policies of reform that he initiated a decade ago, but he also said <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> must stick to socialism. `` There would be no new <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> today without the leadership of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>,'' he said. <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> was a winner of the 1957 Nobel Prize for Physics.

 Security forces have discovered 52 more bodies in central <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>, bringing to 76 the number killed by Sinhalese radicals in three days, the military said today. Elsewhere, soldiers Friday fatally shot 11 Sinhalese radicals and arrested 226 others, said military officials. The officials said the 52 unidentified bodies had been found since Friday in the villages of <LOCATION> Kundasala </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Menikhinna </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Arangala </LOCATION> in central <LOCATION> Kandy </LOCATION> district, about 55 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION>. The militants killed six Sinhalese civilians in three separate attacks Friday, said the officials, who can not be identified under briefing rules. On Thursday, they said, 18 bodies with gunshot wounds were found by security forces in the area. Authorities blamed the killings on the radical Sinhalese group the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, which is trying to overthrow the Sinhalese-dominated government and which attacks civilians not supporting its cause. Officials also accused militants of setting fire to 30 homes. Sinhalese radicals oppose a July 1987 accord the government signed in an attempt to end Tamils' war for a separate homeland. The Sinhalese said the accord granted too many concessions to the minority Tamils and compromised <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>'s sovereignty by inviting Indian soldiers to enforce the accord. Tamils, who are mostly Hindu, make up 18 percent of <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>'s 16 million people They say they are denied jobs and education by the mainly <ORGANIZATION> Buddhist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sinhalese </ORGANIZATION>, who comprise 75 percent of the population and dominate the government and military. More than 11,000 people, including 1,000 Indian soldiers, have been killed since the Tamil insurgency began in 1983. Five thousand others have died in the Sinhalese backlash.

 A sudden thunderstorm dumped almost 4 inches of rain in two hours, killing two children who were swept away after a surge of water toppled a van on a city street, officials said. About 400 people were evacuated, some in boats, and lightning caused scattered power outages as the storm pounded this southeastern <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> city of 60,000 Friday evening. Fear of more rain today prompted officials to call in crews to prepare sandbags, and divers, dogs and soldiers from nearby <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bragg </LOCATION> helped in the search for other possible victims. `` The showers turned to a deluge and they just would n't stop,'' said police spokesman <PERSON> Jason </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>. <PERSON> Nichole </PERSON> <PERSON> Pifer </PERSON>, 6, and <PERSON> Jamie </PERSON> <PERSON> Childress </PERSON>, 4, drowned after they were hit by a wave as they were trying to get out of a van that tipped over on a street, <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> said. The other occupants of managed to escape the the nearly submerged vehicle. `` We do have search and rescue teams checking to see if there are any more missing people,'' <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, spokesman for the state public safety agency, said today. `` We're not anticipating any more deaths at this point, but we think we do have some people unaccounted for.'' Some cars were still stranded in water up to their roofs this morning. `` Just a few minutes ago, they pulled a car out of some water that had two people in it,'' <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> said this morning. The two were not injured. He said officials and residents this morning were preparing for more rain. `` We've got more people coming in to prepare sandbags and environmental services folks are coming in to unclog the drains, and buses are coming in for possible evacuation procedures,'' he said. Police used city buses to evacuate residents living in a half-mile radius of <LOCATION> Glenville </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION>, as water spilled over the lake's dam Streets and bridges were damaged by the high water, <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> said. Emergency shelters were set up at the <ORGANIZATION> Fayetteville </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armory </ORGANIZATION> and a church, officials said. In <LOCATION> Raleigh </LOCATION>, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Brackett </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said weather officials did not issue a flood warning until just after 9 p.m., an hour after the storm began. `` We had expected the thundershowers which were forecast,'' <PERSON> Brackett </PERSON> said. `` The flooding was totally unpredictable.'' <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Henning </PERSON>, the manager of <LOCATION> Hillsboro </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Taxi </LOCATION>, said Friday night that there was two feet of standing water in his office building, and other area buildings were flooded. `` The phones are ringing off the hook, but we ca n't float nowhere,'' <PERSON> Henning </PERSON> said. `` We are getting all kinds of business, but we just ca n't do nothing. `` If we had a boat, we'd be in pretty good shape,'' he said.

 U.S.-based investors have contracted with a southern <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> city to produce up to 300,000 small cars a year in what would be the biggest foreign-funded enterprise in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, Chinese and foreign sources said today. The official <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> reported the project, but a foreign commerical official said it was highly uncertain it would be carried out. <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> said $ 250 million is to be invested in <ORGANIZATION> Panda </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Huizhou </LOCATION>, a small city east of the <LOCATION> Guangdong </LOCATION> provincial capital of <LOCATION> Canton </LOCATION> and 54 miles from a nearby port to <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> China </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, another official agency, said the first stage of the project will be finished by 1995, but that the first cars will be produced as early as next year. All the vehicles will be exported, it said. It said <LOCATION> Huizhou </LOCATION> city was preparing to borrow $ 54 million to build power generating plants, docks and other facilities needed for the factory. The official reports did not identify the foreign investors. A foreign commercial official in <LOCATION> Canton </LOCATION> said one of the main backers was Dr. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Kim </PERSON>, a Korean-American who formerly worked for the <ORGANIZATION> Small </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. The company's home office is in <LOCATION> Arlington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va </LOCATION> The official said the company was incorporated in <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> in September 1988 and former Republican Sen. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Laxalt </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> was listed as a legal adviser, but that little was known about who was behind the project or how much of the project they were financing. Officials of the company reached in <LOCATION> Huizhou </LOCATION> referred all questions to the home office in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>. The commercial official said it did not appear that any major American or Japanese automaker was involved in the project. He said <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, which has shown an interest in expanding its investment in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, has also denied putting money in <LOCATION> Huizhou </LOCATION>. `` The whole premise is very, very iffy,'' said the official, speaking on condition of anonymity. He referred to the difficulty of obtaining quality parts in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and the question of whether there is an international market for 300,000 vehicles made in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. The commercial official noted that top leaders in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> approved the decision before the June military crackdown on the student protest movement and the ouster of <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> <PERSON> Ziyang </PERSON> and other reformists. `` Unfortunately the top is no longer there,'' he said, adding it is not certain the current conservative leadership will let the project proceed. The project also runs counter to attempts to consolidate <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s slumping auto industry and bring it under the control of central planners in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> The State Council, or cabinet, late last year announced it will no longer approve joint ventures involving cars and that passenger car production will be confined to six major manufacturers. They include the First Automotive Works in northern <LOCATION> Jilin </LOCATION>, which is making Audis in cooperation with <ORGANIZATION> Volkswagen </ORGANIZATION>; the Second Automotive Works in central <LOCATION> Hubei </LOCATION> province; the Japan-backed <ORGANIZATION> Tianjin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Automotive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>; the <ORGANIZATION> Shanghai </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Volkswagen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Auto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>; the <ORGANIZATION> Beijing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jeep </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, a <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> subsidiary; and the <ORGANIZATION> Guangzhou </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peugeot </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Automobile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. Chinese auto officials say they want to produce up to 700,000 passenger cars by the year 2000; only 33,000 were made last year out of total vehicle production of about 560,000 In the first half of 1989, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> produced 290,000 vehicles, including 37,800 passenger cars. But a tough government austerity plan, including a ban on most public institutions buying cars, has led to plummeting sales and huge inventories.

 She stood in the gutter outside C.M. <ORGANIZATION> Russell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in the chill morning sun of early fall, hugging her craggy-faced biology teacher _ and crying for him. `` My teachers are my friends, and I support them,'' said 15-year-old <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Gillin </PERSON>. Teacher <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Kenczka </PERSON>, the morning picket captain for strikers at the school, is one of about 700 of the city's 720 teachers who have been strike since Aug. 27. More than 500 substitutes have filled in since classes began Sept. 5. `` I do n't think this will end until they -LRB- the school board -RRB- see these kids as we see them,'' said <PERSON> Kenczka </PERSON>, who returned the girl's hug <PERSON> Kenczka </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Russell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> biology </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> department </ORGANIZATION> last year, has been a teacher for 34 years. <PERSON> Ann </PERSON>, the granddaughter of <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>'s Republican Gov <PERSON> Stan </PERSON> <PERSON> Stephens </PERSON>, refused to attend a substitute's class, declaring to her parents that she would honor the picket line The strike in this prairie city about 70 miles northwest of <PERSON> Helena </PERSON>, the capital, has sharply divided the community's 60,000 residents. The only previous teachers strike in <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Falls </LOCATION> was in 1975. `` Standing out here and watching somebody walk past you into your classroom is like standing in your driveway and watching somebody sleep in your bed,'' said <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON>, a fourth-grade teacher at <LOCATION> Riverview </LOCATION> Elementary who declined to give her full name. The school board and the <ORGANIZATION> Great </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Falls </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> remain in disagreement over about 20 issues, including salaries, insurance and transfer policy. Talks are continuing, haltingly. Frustration on all sides _ teachers, administrators, students, parents _ is building into anger. <ORGANIZATION> Outside </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Great </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Falls </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, one of the city's two high schools, teachers shouted `` Scab! Scab!'' recently at substitutes filing into the school. Some of the substitutes instinctively hunched their shoulders as they passed the gantlet of strikers. Later, inside the high school, one of the substitutes called the harassment `` terrorism.'' But most were quiet about their situation, saying they did n't have time for an interview during school hours. None of the substitute teachers took up invitations to talk later. At <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Falls </LOCATION> <LOCATION> High </LOCATION>, female pupils repeatedly came to hug striking teachers, and some cried. Grim-faced boys offered encouragement and complained that the substitutes were incompetent. But many students who entered the school _ attendance has increased gradually to more than 70 percent _ averted their eyes and did not speak as they walked past the teachers. `` A lot of these kids need hugs,'' said <PERSON> Karol </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, principal at Great Falls High. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said she feels caught in the middle. She makes a point of stopping to talk with the strikers each day. `` There are some of my staff who will have a hard time forgiving me for that,'' she said. She helped negotiate the last three contracts, but declined to get involved in the prickly talks this year. Recently, though, she joined four secondary principals in sending a letter to the superintendent urging a settlement. `` I want my staff back,'' she said. `` The subs are working hard, but they are substitutes.'' At <LOCATION> Riverview </LOCATION>, the mood was calmer. The strikers have a barbecue grill in the parking lot. The young children often come to them at recess to ask when they will come back, the teachers said. The teachers said it's hard explaining contracts to kindergarteners. But, they said, the children understand the word `` fair.''

 Soldiers patrolled city streets today and the air force reiterated orders to force down suspicious aircraft following drug-related violence that killed two policemen on the eve of a holiday celebrating love and friendship. As the nation observed the Day of Love and Friendship, army soldiers on foot and in jeeps roamed <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Cali </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Barranquilla </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s four biggest cities. On Friday, gunmen firing from a speeding car killed two police officers in <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION>, police reported. Later Friday, assailants also in a speeding car opened fire at the daily newspaper <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Siglo </ORGANIZATION>, police said. No one was injured in that attack. In the cocaine capital of <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION>, two policemen were wounded when a bomb exploded near a police truck Friday. And in <LOCATION> Cali </LOCATION>, home of another major cocaine cartel, three bombs wounded two policemen and seven civilians, police said. They said another bomb found at a bus station was deactived. No one claimed responsibility for the attacks, but suspicion fell on the nation's drug lords, who have been at war for a month with the government. The <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> put the country's 200,000-man army and 80,000 national police on alert, canceling all leaves and keeping the forces on standby. <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION> police chief <PERSON> Nasin </PERSON> <PERSON> Gianini </PERSON> <PERSON> Diaz </PERSON> said reports of `` telephone terrorism,'' in which callers make bomb and death threats, increased in the capital on the eve of today's national holiday, during which Colombians exchange gifts. `` Citizens should take the threats seriously and report them to police,'' he said in an interview on Colombian television. `` But we are guaranteeing a peaceful Day of Love and Friendship.'' Armored trucks and army troops were sent to guard banks and government buildings. Banks are frequent targets of the nation's powerful cocaine traffickers. They have declared `` total and absolute war'' on the government, which began a crackdown on trafficking after a leading presidential candidate, Sen. <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Galan </PERSON>, was assassinated Aug. 18. As part of its effort to combat drug trafficking, <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s air force issued orders 12 years ago for its pilots to force down civilian planes that do not have permission to fly over <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>. The air force commander, Gen. <PERSON> Alfonso </PERSON> <PERSON> Amaya </PERSON>, sent a copy of the orders to the civil aeronautics agency Friday as a reminder of the policy. The air force has forced down dozens of planes without flight plans in the past 12 years but never has resorted to shooting down a plane. Under emergency powers decreed by President <PERSON> Virgilio </PERSON> <PERSON> Barco </PERSON>, authorities have confiscated hundreds of properties allegedly belonging to drug kingpins and pledged to extradite drug suspects wanted in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. So far, one person has been extradited, <PERSON> Eduardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> <PERSON> Romero </PERSON>, an alleged whiz financier for the <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> cartel. He was flown to <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> Sept. 6, where he is to stand trial on money laundering charges. Two other drug suspects are being held in a maximum security prison pending extradition to <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> and to <LOCATION> Tallahassee </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s top cocaine barons have escaped capture, however In the <LOCATION> Canadian </LOCATION> province of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Brunswick </LOCATION> Friday, authorities said they had linked five men arrested with an arsenal of weapons to two Colombians accused of importing drugs into that country. The five men were carrying Venezuelan passports and were arrested in <LOCATION> Edmundston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Brunswick </LOCATION>, on Wednesday and Thursday.

<HEAD>Bikes Help Protect Environment, but Mostly the Poor Pedal</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BRISCOE</BYLINE>
<UNK></UNK>
<TEXT>
 Associated Press Writer + _ The bicycle can help solve some of the world's worst pollution and economic problems, but in many countries only the poor pedal, a new study In the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> there is nearly one bike for every two people, but many Americans drive cars to health clubs where they ride stationary excercise bikes, said researcher <PERSON> Marcia </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lowe </PERSON> in a report published Sunday. In countries that have fewer cars, she said, bikes carry commuters, deliver milk, haul squealing pigs, and deliver the mail. Worldwide, 800 million cycles outnumber cars 2-to-1. By contrast, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> built 6 million bikes and 8 million cars in 1987. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, in the same year, produced 41 million bikes and 4,065 autombiles, Ms. <PERSON> Lowe </PERSON> said in `` The Bicycle: Vehicle for a Small Planet,'' a <ORGANIZATION> Worldwatch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> report. The institute is an independent, nonprofit research organization that analyzes environmental and economic issues. Many countries that should be producing and using more bicycles and tricycles are pouring money into automobile manufacturing, roads and industries to support a mode of transportation most of their population can not afford, Ms. <PERSON> Lowe </PERSON> said at a briefing on the report. `` One of the greatest ironies of the 20th century is that around the globe, vast amounts of such priceless things as land, petroleum and clean air have been relinquished for motorization _ and yet most people in the world will never own an automobile,'' she said. Nearly $ 1 billion in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> oil imports could be saved if 10 percent of <LOCATION> Americans </LOCATION> switched to bicycles for at least part of their commute to work, said Ms. <PERSON> Lowe </PERSON>, who practices what she preaches in traffic-clogged <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. Bicycle promotional groups say less than one commuter in a hundred pedals to work in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Some of the poorest countries are hostile to pedal traffic because bicycles are viewed as `` vehicles of the poor,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Lowe </PERSON>. In <LOCATION> Jakarta </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION>, she said, city officials confiscated 100,000 cycle rickshaws over the past five years and dumped them into the sea. Governments trying to eliminate such conveyances declare them unsafe or inhumane, `` but the more likely motive is to clear the streets of vehicles that make the city look poor and backward,'' the report says. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Replogle </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> and Development Policy, said his organization tries to encourage governments to put less emphasis on expensive road building and more on producing vehicles people can afford and use. Ms. <PERSON> Lowe </PERSON>'s report says many roads in poorer countries are more useful for drying beans and peppers than moving traffic. The <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION> are the most bicycle-friendly developed countries, the report says. The <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION> has the world's highest density of both cycle lanes and cars, it says, while 32 percent of Danish commuters cycle to work. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>' most cycling-conscious communities are <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Palo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Alto </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, Ms. <PERSON> Lowe </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> has 30 miles of bicycle lanes for every 100 miles of streets. <LOCATION> Palo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Alto </LOCATION>'s city government pays its employees seven cents a mile for business travel by bike and the police department has a bicycle squad, she said. <LOCATION> Palo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Alto </LOCATION> also has found an answer to some of the drawbacks in getting employees to bike to work: a 1983 zoning ordinance requires that larger new building be provided not only with bicycle parking but also with employee showers.

<HEAD>State Department, Congress May Be at Odds Over Drift Net Ban</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LES BLUMENTHAL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> are in disagreement over how quickly the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> should now move to seek an international ban on drift net fishing. With initialing of a tentative treaty with the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Koreans </LOCATION> earlier this month, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has now concluded scientific monitoring and enforcement agreements with the three nations that have <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> drift net fleets. But the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> does n't want to consider an outright ban until scientists have had time to asses data that will be collected under the new agreements with <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>. `` It would be premature for the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government to announce a policy of seeking to ban drift nets,'' <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolfe </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s ambassador for oceans and fisheries, said in an interview. More than 50 <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> members, however, have signed on to legislation that would essentially direct the secretary of state to seek immediately an international ban and provide <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in six months with a list of the nations that refused to negotiate. `` It's time for action,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Jolene </PERSON> <PERSON> Unsoeld </PERSON>, D-Wash., the principal sponsor of the bill `` We do n't need more studies.'' Pressure to seek an international end to the use of drift nets is coming from two groups: <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> fishermen who believe the high seas catch has already depleted <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> salmon and steelhead stocks, and environmentalists who believe the nets cause indiscriminate slaughter of marine life. The lighweight monofilament nets, which environmentalists have likened to `` walls of death,'' can stretch for more than 30 miles, snaring any animal that comes in contact. On any given day, the nets can cover an estimated 30,000 miles of ocean. More that 700 vessels from <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> have been using drift nets in the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> ostensibly to catch squid. But <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> fishermen say the foreign fleets have served as a `` front'' for the illegal harvest of up to 30,000 metric tons of salmon and steelhead worth roughly $ 30 million. Fishermen also believe that foreign trawlers using drift nets are catching large quantities of albacore tuna in the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION>. In addition to the North and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION>, drift nets are now being used by fishermen in the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION>. Environmentalists say use of the drift nets results in the `` methodical destruction'' of thousands of marine mammals, sea birds and other marine life every year. A <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> study released in May said there was reason for `` serious concern'' about the incidental catch of marine mammals, especially northern fur seals, but it did not give any estimates. The report did estimate the nets could potentially snare several hundred thousand seabirds annually. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> observers will be allowed on drift net vessels from <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> under the new treaties and hopefully will be able to collect enough data through the end of the 1990 fishing treaty to adequatetly assess the impact such harvesting. Under international law, anadromous fish such as salmon and steelhead belong to the nation in which they originated. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> also have their own laws regulating where and when their drift net fleets can fish and prohibiting the taking of salmon on the high seas. <PERSON> Wolfe </PERSON> said he expected that the drift net issue will eventually have to be adressed on an international level. `` It's my opinion that because of the severity of the problem, the intensity of the problem and the interest at the highest level of our government that the drift net issue will have to be pursued in a multilateral forum,'' said <PERSON> Wolfe </PERSON>. <PERSON> Unsoeld </PERSON> said she may try to tack her proposed legislation onto a bill reauthorizing the so-called Magnuson Fishing Act when it comes before the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Merchant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fisheries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> in the next week or so.

<HEAD>Environmentalists Not Happy With House Bill Nearing Vote</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 As Exxon suspends its <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> oil cleanup for the winter amid sharp criticism from environmentalists, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> is nearing a vote that critics say could limit how much oil companies would have to pay for major spills. Earlier this year, environmentalists applauded approval by a 99-0 vote in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> of legislation that would impose unlimited liability against a shipper responsible for an oil spill and a $ 1 billion oil industry cleanup fund. But the House version of the bill, which is expected to come to a vote this week, has prompted a letter-writing campaign from a dozen environmental groups who say the measure would reduce, not strengthen, protection against oil spills and weaken cleanup requirements. `` This is an industry bailout bill,'' snapped <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Frampton </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Wilderness </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>. `` It weakens current oil spill law and caters to the oil industry,'' charged <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Gardiner </PERSON>, legislative director of the <ORGANIZATION> Sierra </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> bills would have to be reconciled before final legislation is approved by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. In the weeks after the Exxon Valdez tanker fouled hundreds of miles of <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>'s pristine shoreline last March, members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> clamored to sign onto proposals aimed at making sure industry prepares better for future spills and that federal law more clearly spells out a polluter's liability. But the legislation that has actually emerged from two <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> committees _ both often friendly to oil and shipping interests _ contains provisions the environmentalists say fall far short of those rhetorical clamors. Oil industry spokesmen have supported the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> legislation and point out that _ like the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> version _ it would establish for the first time a $ 1 billion industry fund to deal with cleanup efforts. The fund would come from a surcharge on each barrel of oil. Environmentalists argue this would simply pass costs on to the consumer and provide no incentive for companies to take precautions against oil spills. The environmental groups, ranging from the 5.8 million-member <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> to the relatively small <ORGANIZATION> Izaak </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Walton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION>, are alarmed about provisions in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> legislation that would: _ Put a cap, possibly as low as $ 60 million, on a shipper's direct liability for a spill Such a level dwarfs the already acknowledged $ 1 billion to $ 2 billion cleanup costs being talked about from the Exxon spill. _ Override stronger oil spill liability laws in effect in 18 states. These state laws have no liability ceiling and allow civil suits for damages against the oil companies involved in a spill. _ Allow for a narrow definition in calculating the value of a natural resource such as wildlife, fish and birds. Such calculations would let an oil company off the hook by not making them pay for long-term restoration of such resources, conservationists charge. The <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, the oil industry trade organization, has argued that unlimited direct liability for a spill makes it difficult to obtain insurance and that the various state laws foster the filing of too many lawsuits. The industry has sought a federal liability law that would preempt state laws for years, but each time has been unsuccessful. Rep. <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.C. </LOCATION>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Merchant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fisheries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> and one of the sponsors of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> bill, disputes claims that the oil companies would benefit by the legislation. <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>' committee approved the bill by a voice vote last Thursday. Committee staffers point out that a shipper would still be directly liable for cleanup costs beyond the ceiling established by the bill if gross negligence can be shown and the oil industry still would have to pay for up to $ 1 billion in cleanup costs, albeit through the special fund fueled by surcharges. Environmentalists maintain that the catch is in proving gross negligence on the part of a corporation _ as opposed to an individual that might work for the corporation. A floor vote is expected on the bill by midweek and environmentalists are hoping amendments to be offered by Reps. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Calif </LOCATION>., and <PERSON> Gerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Studds </PERSON>, D-Mass., will bring it more closely in line with the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> `` This will show which representatives sides with big oil and which takes the side of environmental protection,'' said <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Maddy </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conservation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Voters </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>Scholars on Washington: Workaholic, Formal, Fond of Women and Horses</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Scholars agreed that the former president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was no intellectual, was fond of horses and had few close personal friendships. They denied that he was a figurehead `` spun around by the whiz kids in his Cabinet.'' Sound like a seminar on <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>? Guess again. The panel discussion was a highlight of a three-day conference, winding up here Saturday, on `` <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Washington </PERSON> and the American Presidency.'' The event was sponsored by the <ORGANIZATION> Mount </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Vernon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ladies </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, which runs <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s restored home at nearby <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vernon </LOCATION>, and the American Studies Center The conference was held as part of the observance of the bicentennial of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s inauguration as president in 1789. The picture of the nation's first president that emerges is of a workaholic, a demanding taskmaster, chillingly formal in his public demeanor, something of a nitpicker, and a charmer with women. `` I am not sure that I would really call <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Washington </PERSON> a warm person,'' <PERSON> Christine </PERSON> <PERSON> Meadows </PERSON>, curator of <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vernon </LOCATION>, said during Friday's panel. `` He had a great sense of the respect that was due to rank and position and a strong feeling that if one had attained that position, then he was due a great deal of respect,'' Ms. <PERSON> Meadows </PERSON> said. `` And he conducted himself that way in public.'' She said he had `` few close relationships'' although family members said he could be warm and informal when out of the public eye. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Stagg </PERSON>, associate professor of history at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Virginia </ORGANIZATION> and editor in chief of `` The Papers of <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Madison </PERSON>,'' said <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and his close associates had forged their relationships in the politics of colonial <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> and `` they were much more pragmatic, more political, than they would be purely personal.'' `` Everything went in his daily life according to clockwork,'' Ms. <PERSON> Meadows </PERSON> said. `` Nobody entered his study without his personal invitation. In that sense he was, perhaps with -LRB- <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> -RRB- <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON>, sharing an apparent workaholism. `` You are almost in awe of his capacity for detail. He must have driven people crazy who worked for him. He was a nitpicker to some extent.'' <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON>, executive director of <LOCATION> Monticello </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Jefferson </PERSON>'s restored mansion near <LOCATION> Charlottesville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, said <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> freely acknowledged his own lack of a formal education `` Some historians have made a great deal of this and suggested that he was spun around by the whiz kids in his Cabinet and that they led him by the hand for their own purposes against his own interest,'' <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON> said. `` I do n't think that argument holds water.'' Scholars have concluded that <PERSON> Jefferson </PERSON>, <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON> and <PERSON> Madison </PERSON> would all score in the genius range if they could take an I.Q. test, the <PERSON> Jefferson </PERSON> specialist said. `` In that company, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> might appear a bit slow, but who would n't?'' he asked. He cited <PERSON> Jefferson </PERSON>'s own judgment of the first president: `` His mind was great and powerful, without being of the first order.'' The panelists did not press any comparisons with <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, but critics have also pictured the immediate past president as a man of ordinary intelligence who served as a front man for policies worked out by his subordinates. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s supporters defend him against this criticism, and <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON> defended <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, saying, `` There is n't any question from the record and from what he accomplished and achieved that he was plenty sharp judgmentally.'' <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON> argued that judgment and courage are more important in a president than intellectual brilliance anyway. <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Schechter </PERSON>, a political scientist who is chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bicentennial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, was asked about <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s fondness for horses, a trait that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> shares `` He had his life divided into parts, public service and home,'' <PERSON> Schechter </PERSON> said. `` I think <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> truly held nothing more valuable than his return home and that return had much that went along with it involving agriculture and horses and the like.'' Asked whether <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> warmed up in feminine company, Ms. <PERSON> Meadows </PERSON> replied, `` He enjoyed women and they found him enormously interesting. He seemed to be more at ease with women.''

 Fifty years after World War II, <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> is again in ferment. The post-postwar era is dawning. As the western half of the continent approaches a watershed in the long trek toward union, its rival bloc beyond the Iron Curtain is falling to pieces. For <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, democracy beckons. <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, having spurned the new spirit of <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, suffers the humiliation of more than 14,000 of its citizens fleeing West. These refugees, most of them young and skilled, are the lifeblood of the 40-year-old Communist state. Yet they have chosen to cut themselves off from roots, friends and families and take their chances in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION>. The phenomenon is not new. Hundreds have died attempting to breach the 28-year-old Berlin Wall or the watch-towered frontier that divides the Germanys. What is breathtakingly different is that they fled via <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, once one of the hard-line <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> bloc countries, now reformed and liberalized in a manner that leaves its ally <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> looking like a dinosaur. The whole continent of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> has embarked on an adventure. The geopolitical order that was imposed after World War II and defined by an Iron Curtain from the Baltic to the <LOCATION> Adriatic </LOCATION> is crumbling, and no one can say what finally will take its place. `` The ` new <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>' is not yet born, but it is gestating,'' writes <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Vernet </PERSON>, a senior editor of the French daily <ORGANIZATION> Le </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monde </ORGANIZATION>. Much depends on whether <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> can keep control of the forces his reforms have unleashed. Will <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> allow its satellites to fly into new, uncharted orbits? Can it contain the pent-up ethnic and nationalist rage simmering in <LOCATION> Latvia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Uzbekistan </LOCATION> and other Soviet republics? Can the West afford the kind of aid needed to keep the new democracies afloat? There is widespread rejection of orthodox Communism and an admission of its political, economic and social failures. Meanwhile, in <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, the 12 states of the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> are about to pool their sovereignty and cement their political and economic union at the end of 1992 in what some will be tempted to call a united states of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. A huge bloc of 320 million people, untrammeled by frontiers, is about to emerge. Fifty years ago they were at war with each other. `` <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> is rediscovering itself. It is now able to put a line under the Second World War, look at itself and see where we are in the world,'' says <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Elphick </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> spokesman in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. `` Eastern Europeans are also rediscovering themselves and falling back on old traditions, expressing themselves through their own culture and not through something imported from outside by forceable means,'' he said in an interview. East and West, compelling images are being etched almost daily on European minds: an East German woman painting a West German insignia onto her car before crossing the border; giant machines digging a tunnel to link <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>; in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc's first non-Communist premier. While the unity of <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> is the outcome of a plodding, painstaking process that began soon after World War II, events in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> are provoked by what French analyst <PERSON> Eva </PERSON> <PERSON> Kulesza </PERSON> calls `` an acceleration of history.'' The postwar order, `` so threatening and yet so stable, so basically unacceptable and yet so reassuringly predictable, is unraveling at an accelerating pace,'' says <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Heisbourg </PERSON>, director of the London-based <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Strategic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studies </ORGANIZATION>. It `` may make adjustment difficult and sow the seeds of future instability,'' he wrote in The Independent newspaper in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Detlef </PERSON> <PERSON> Kuhn </PERSON>, director of the <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION> government's <ORGANIZATION> All-German </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, believes the refugee exodus has made German reunification a live issue. In an interview, <PERSON> Kuhn </PERSON> argued that if <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> were to implement the reforms needed to make it attractive to its 17 million citizens, the country would have to dump Communism, and then would cease to have any reason to exist. `` My analysis is that unification would solve so many problems that we would have an economic boom, which is good not only for <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> but <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> as a whole,'' <PERSON> Kuhn </PERSON> said. But the world may not be ready for an even bigger <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> dominating the heart of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> with its mighty economic muscle. `` If you go beyond the ritual calling for pulling down the <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> Wall, I think there is a feeling that German unification might not be desirable,'' says <PERSON> Jonathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Hyde-Price </PERSON>, an analyst at the <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. Since it is assumed that <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> would tolerate a reunited <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> only if it were neutral, he said in an interview, `` I think there's a feeling that <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> is too important for <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> to risk losing. Most analysts say it's far too early to write <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s obituary The Economist calculated that even with the exodus via <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, proportionately fewer people have left <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> in the past year than emigrate from <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>, yet `` Nobody assumes the collapse of <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>.'' But it concluded unification would be the world's biggest change in 40 years, and `` is no longer a subject from which the eye can be comfortably averted.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Kulesza </PERSON>, head of Soviet and East European research at the independent <ORGANIZATION> French </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION>, agrees. `` What I'm worried about is whether we are really prepared for it _ do we really wanted a united <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>?'' she said in an interview. In a profoundly gloomy analysis, <ORGANIZATION> Oxford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> Professor <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> writes that the economic odds against <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> may be insurmountable, even with massive Western aid. `` The danger is that the decay of the totalitarian system built up by <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lenin </PERSON> will result not in the reconstitution of a stable civil society, but in mounting chaos, economic collapse and the destabilization of the experiments in controlled democracy in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>.'' If so, he wrote, `` Then what we are now witnessing in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> is not the middle of a reform, but the beginnings of a revolution, whose course no one can foresee.'' <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> Stone </PERSON>, professor of modern history at <ORGANIZATION> Oxford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, sees `` the wheel turning full circle,'' to a point where `` We may, at long last, be realizing the aims with which we went to war 50 years ago. `` There are many problems to come,'' he wrote in The Sunday Times, `` but 1989 is a good year to be alive; we may, at long last, have won the war.''

<HEAD>After Koch: A Clash of Quieter Styles</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 One dresses like an undertaker and talks like a diplomat; the other more resembles an ex-altar boy. Neither even remotely takes after <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Koch </PERSON>, the city's celebrated, reviled and garrulous mayor since 1977. But one of them will take his job. The altar boy is <PERSON> Rudolph </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON>, winner of last week's Republican mayoral primary His opponent is <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON>, who toppled <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> in the Democratic contest with surprising ease. Whoever wins the general election, political analysts say the two mark a new era of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> politics. <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON> is the first Republican in 25 years with a shot at City Hall. <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON> would be the first black mayor. `` In a thematic way, New Yorkers are looking for change. The voting in both primaries suggested that,'' said <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Harding </PERSON>, chief of the city's tiny <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, whose nomination <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON> also holds. `` In the general election, change is the paramount issue.'' <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON> hopes so. He is the ultimate political outsider, a Republican in an overwhelmingly Democratic city, a former federal prosecutor who made his name chasing corruption in city government and <LOCATION> Wall </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Street </LOCATION>, a man who never has held elective office. `` <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON>'s principal asset is that he has no background in government. Therefore he can say he's going to change things,'' said <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> <PERSON> Moss </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> at <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. `` He can take the full offense: He says, ` I'll clean house.''' True to form, in accepting the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> nomination Tuesday night, <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON> described his campaign as a `` crusade'' to establish `` a new generation of leadership in this city.'' The next day he personalized the attack, calling <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON> a `` clubhouse politician'' tied to a discredited Democratic regime. Still, <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON>, 45, faces formidable odds. Two-thirds of the city's 3 million registered voters are Democrats. It took just 75,000 Republican votes for <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON> to overwhelm his primary opponent, cosmetics heir <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Lauder </PERSON>; <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON>, to defeat <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> and two other Democrats, got nearly 540,000 votes. `` This is a Democratic town with a vengeance,'' said <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> Adler </PERSON>, a veteran political consultant. `` You've got to get a whole lot of Democrats to vote for you if you want to win.'' <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON>, 62, has promptly seized that advantage, making party affiliation a prime issue. `` <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> will not become a Republican beachhead in 1989,'' he declared Wednesday at a rally with his defeated opponents. He personalized his attack as well, characterizing <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON> as an agent of `` reactionary Republican government.'' The two are likely to tangle on other issues, including legal abortion, which <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON> supports and <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON> has addressed equivocally; the death penalty, which <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON> supports and <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON> opposes; and drugs and crime, on which <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON> seeks to counter <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON>'s crimefighting image. But neither is a Koch, whose acid tongue created issues as often as it addressed them. <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON>'s first words Tuesday night were to congratulate <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON> and pledge `` a race that unites <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>.'' And <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON> called himself `` the guy that brings people together.'' The prime challenge for <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> borough president, is to bring even more voters together than he did in the primary. He won nine in 10 black voters, half the Hispanics and roughly three in 10 whites, mainly the young and the liberal. But he lost <LOCATION> Queens </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Staten </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, the boroughs with the largest white populations. `` The same people who said <PERSON> David </PERSON> could n't win the primary for any number of reasons _ too black, too <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>, too liberal _ now will say the same thing about his race against <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Adler </PERSON> said. But broadening his appeal was <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON>' byword in the primary. A career officeholder who served 10 years as city clerk, he is a formal, reserved and conciliatory figure, so reticent his critics call him indecisive. `` <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON>' principal asset is that he represents a new group whose time has come,'' <PERSON> Moss </PERSON> said. `` He provides an opportunity for blacks and <PERSON> Hispanics </PERSON> to take a major leadership role in municipal government.'' At the same time, he said, `` The challenge is for <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON> to disassociate himself from the perception that he's the candidate of one interest group. And to demonstrate that he's a black candidate, running for mayor, who is concerned with all people.''

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Yehya </PERSON> <PERSON> Mansour </PERSON> could hear the exploding artillery shells as he flipped his radio from one station to another, trying to find which neighborhoods were being pounded by the Christian guns. The <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Voice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lebanon </ORGANIZATION> reported that the Syrians, firing from Moslem west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> where <PERSON> Mansour </PERSON> lives, were hitting the <LOCATION> Ashrafiyeh </LOCATION> district in east <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. That was enough for <PERSON> Mansour </PERSON>. He grabbed one of his daughters, and his wife grabbed the other. They ran down the stairs to shelter in the basement of their apartment block in west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Verdun </LOCATION> neighborhood. <PERSON> Mansour </PERSON>, a 32-year-old bank clerk, has learned in six months of artillery battles between the Syrians and Christians that when <LOCATION> Ashrafiyeh </LOCATION> gets hit, the Christians respond by shelling <LOCATION> Verdun </LOCATION>. `` Thank God for the radios,'' <PERSON> Mansour </PERSON> puffed as he settled the family in the shelter. `` They're our lifeline, our companion. If it was n't for them, we would n't know what was going on.'' In the basement, <PERSON> Mansour </PERSON> huddled with his family and channel-hopped between all five of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>'s radio stations, <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> and Moslem, to keep track of what was happening. Many families use four or five transistor radios tuned to different stations for news of the fighting, in which more than 800 people have been killed and more than 2,500 wounded since March 8. <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>'s stations also broadcast survival tips such as how to minimize the effect of shrapnel or how to keep children amused in the long hours in the bunker. During heavy shelling, the radios drop their regular programs of music, comedy shows and dramas to broadcast messages from residents to families and friends to assure them they're safe. `` <PERSON> Salami </PERSON> <PERSON> Abul-Mouna </PERSON> is trapped in his office. He assures his family in <LOCATION> Verdun </LOCATION> he is safe,'' an announcer said on the Voice of the People, run by the <ORGANIZATION> Lebanese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. `` That's our son,'' <PERSON> Mansour </PERSON>'s wife <PERSON> Munir </PERSON> shouted with joy. `` Thank God he's alive.'' That night, the Voice of the People read thousands of messages from Beirutis for four straight hours. The Voice of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, run by the right-wing <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Phalange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, has a big audience in the Arab world and <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> for its daily `` Reunion of the Beloved'' program, in which Lebanese send tape-recorded messages to relatives abroad to let them know they're well Each station has its own distinctive signature tune to announce a flash. Voice of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, for instance, uses the theme music from the movie `` Shaft.'' Radio reporters risk their lives to hop from one stricken district to another, feeding on-the-spot reports to their stations by radio telephone. `` I feel I'm providing a humanitarian service,'' said <PERSON> Nafiz </PERSON> <PERSON> Kawwas </PERSON>, a Sunni Molem reporter with the Voice of the Nation. `` People depend on me to know what's happening.'' Some of the radio stations have gone underground themselves to escape the shelling. The 12-story Voice of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> building has taken six direct hits. Voice of the Nation's eight-floor building has been hit once. The state-run <ORGANIZATION> Beirut </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> has been hit several times. Only the <ORGANIZATION> Voice </ORGANIZATION> of the People and the <ORGANIZATION> Voice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Free </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lebanon </ORGANIZATION>, run by the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lebanese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> militia </ORGANIZATION>, have escaped unscathed. Voice of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, its main eighth-floor studios badly exposed to Syrian shellfire, has set up a sandbagged `` emergency newsroom'' on the less vulnerable first floor. Voice of the Nation has built set up a newsroom, control room, workshop and library in the basement of its building. Like the other stations, it has also set up living quarters for its personnel, so they can stay at the station for days on end during heavy periods of bombardment. `` We can take up to 40 people at a time,'' said <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Mashnouk </PERSON>, who heads the committee that runs the station. `` We've got mattresses, refrigerators, water and food in the basement. The station has adapted its work schedules because of the shelling so that teams work `` one week in, one week out,'' Mashnouk noted. `` Many of the our people have taken their families out of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> for safety and this was the most convenient solution so that they will come to work,'' he explained.

<HEAD>New Challenge For Pilots: Fly The Airline</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BRISCOE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The dream of some pilots to buy their own planes and run an airline is becoming reality for 6,326 <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> flyers, who will have to learn to operate in the boardroom as well as the cockpit. The federal government, Wall Street analysts, aviation experts and employees of other airlines are watching closely the employee-management buyout of <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION>, approved last week by the airline's parent company, <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. Some say it should make <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION>'s advertised `` friendly skies'' even friendlier, but the $ 7.2 billion deal that would make <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> the nation's largest employee-owned company still faces some obstacles and raises some scepticism. It wo n't be the first time a pilot has owned an airline or moved in with management. But it will be the first time employees have taken a controlling interest in a major carrier. The pilots' share would be 75 percent, with 10 percent held by current management and 15 percent by <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION>. The deal still faces potential hurdles, including participation of the machinists and flight attendants unions and approval by shareholders and the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION>. And despite <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> approval, a competing bid by <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> billionaire <PERSON> Marvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> still looms. On Friday, he offered to match the $ 300-per-share deal if the pilot's plan falls through. `` Pilots spend more time in the cockpit discussing how they'd run the airline than anything else,'' said <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Crawford </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> pilot who joined management and now runs <ORGANIZATION> AVITAS </ORGANIZATION>, an aviation consulting firm. `` If anyone is cut out to run an airline, it's the pilots,'' he said, but added that does n't necessarily mean pilots will make the best managers for a complex company like <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION>. Some of them tend to see little beyond the aircraft itself, he said. United pilots do n't intend to actually run the airline, but they will have a say in who does, and they expect some changes, including less acrimony between employees and management. The plan calls for <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON> and chief financial officer <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pope </PERSON> to continue running the company for the new employee-owners, said pilots spokesman <PERSON> Hank </PERSON> <PERSON> Krakowski </PERSON>. He predicted the deal will go through even without participation of machinists, flight attendants or the company's 26,000 nonunion employees. Negotiations are underway to include all 68,000 employees. Passengers might expect some changes, <PERSON> Krakowski </PERSON> said. Pilots are likely to announce over the plane's public address system that the owner is at the wheel, he said. `` I think you'll see pilots more inclined to walk back into the cabin and actually show an interest towards the customer,'' he said. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Joedicke </PERSON>, advisory director of the Wall Street firm of <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION>, said <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> could become `` more attractive from the aspect of service'' because employees who own the company are more likely to project a friendly image. He said the deal also should make <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> more competitive on fares because of the wage and work concessions. Aviation analyst <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> <PERSON> Stockman </PERSON> said the arrangement should not make a difference in safety, because <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> already has a top maintenance record, but he said it should make a more harmonious company. `` They wo n't be arguing with management. They'll be arguing with themselves,'' he said. <PERSON> Stockman </PERSON> said, however, the arrangement raises doubts about the future of the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Line </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pilots </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, which represents pilots, questioning whether pilot owners would want to stay in the powerful union. `` Why should they pay dues to protect the employees from themselves?'' he asked. `` We're in unchartered waters here.'' <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Daugherty </PERSON>, aviation analyst for <ORGANIZATION> Dean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Witter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reynolds </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, said the takeover could add to management problems. `` Management has a tough enough time. When you have different voices and groups with different interests involved, it could be even tougher to run the company,'' he said. But <PERSON> Daugherty </PERSON> added that ownership should give employees `` pretty intense interest in making sure the company comes out OK.''

 Hurricane Hugo, the most powerful storm to hit the northeastern <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> in a decade, was bearing down on the <LOCATION> Leeward </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION> today with 140 mph winds and a 10-foot wall of water. `` This is an extremely dangerous hurricane,'' hurricane specialist <PERSON> Max </PERSON> <PERSON> Mayfield </PERSON> at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hurricane </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in suburban <LOCATION> Coral </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gables </LOCATION> said. `` This is stonger than Hurricane <PERSON> David </PERSON> back in 1979,'' which left 1,200 dead in the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. At noon EDT today, <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON>'s center near 15.6 north latitude and 59.0 west longitude, or about 175 miles east-southeast of the <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> resort island of <LOCATION> Guadeloupe </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> Leeward </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION>. It was expected to hit the island this afternoon or tonight, said forecaster <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON>, before moving in the direction of <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>. The hurricane was moving west at 14 mph, sending showers and gusty winds to the eastern edge of the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION>. The storm's strength flucutated this morning, dipping from 150 mph at 6 a.m. to 140 mph at 9 a.m. It was expected to continue to do so as the size of the eye contracts and expands, forecasters said, but storm-force winds of 39 mph and above extend 150 miles from the center. In <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> France </ORGANIZATION> announced it was canceling all three of its flights scheduled today to <LOCATION> Martinique </LOCATION> because of the storm. Miami-based <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> planned no cancellations or reroutings today, but spokesman <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> Matell </PERSON> said, `` We'll keep monitoring it very closely.'' Forecasters wo n't be able to tell for five or six days whether <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON> will hit the coastal <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, forecaster <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Gross </PERSON> said. A hurricane warning was posted from <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lucia </LOCATION> north to <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Martin </LOCATION> including the <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virgin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION>, and a hurricane watch the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virgin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION> may be upgraded to a warning today. A tropical storm watch was in effect for the islands of <LOCATION> Barbados </LOCATION> and <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> Vincent </PERSON>, according to the hurricane center. Forecasters classed the hurricane in Category 4, meaning it is considered capable of extreme damage. If its sustained winds grow to 155 mph, it would be classified in Category 5, capable of catastrophic damage. Only two Category 5 hurricanes have hit the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> since record-keeping began; the latest, <PERSON> Camille </PERSON> in 1969, killed 256 people. Islanders were warned to expect rainfall amounts of 5 to 10 inches and a storm surge with waves 10 feet higher than normal. <LOCATION> Dominica </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Guadeloupe </LOCATION>'s closest neighbor to the south, has only recently recovered from the destruction <PERSON> David </PERSON> wrought 10 years ago, when floods and mud slides poured down from mountains onto coastal towns and villages. On <LOCATION> Martinique </LOCATION>, the next island in the chain, school officials canceled classes today. A disaster response team from <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Metro </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> established a communications center in <LOCATION> Barbados </LOCATION>, about 200 miles south of <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON>'s path, to assess damage and coordinate emergency medical treatment throughout the <LOCATION> Leeward </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION>. At the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> station in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Juan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>, guardsmen were preparing for the storm Friday. `` You go around and police the area and pick up anything that can become a missile hazard,'' Petty Officer <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Burd </PERSON> said. The island chain has escaped the worst of previous hurricanes this year. <PERSON> Dean </PERSON>, <PERSON> Erin </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gabrielle </PERSON> turned north toward <LOCATION> Bermuda </LOCATION> before reaching the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION>. This time, there were no signs of the lowering atmospheric pressure that veered the others away. <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON> is the eighth named storm of the current <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> hurricane season, which runs from June 1 to Nov. 30. Tropical storms have maximum sustained winds of 39 mph and reach hurricane status when winds reach 74 mph.

<TEXT>
 Police confiscated 980 elephant tusks weighing about seven tons Saturday and arrested six men suspected of running an international ivory smuggling operation. Police said the haul was one of the world's largest seizures of poached ivory. Police spokesman Kierie du Rand said the ivory would sell for about $ 1.5 million. Police discovered it when they stopped a truck at <LOCATION> Okahandja </LOCATION>, 45 miles north of <LOCATION> Windhoek </LOCATION>, he said. The tusks are believed to have come from elephants in southern <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> and northern <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s elephant population has fallen from about 1.5 million in 1978 to as few as 400,000, due mostly to poachers who seek the valuable tusks. Several Western nations, including the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, recently have banned the import of ivory, and the 102-nation <ORGANIZATION> Convention </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> in </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Endangered </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Species </ORGANIZATION> will consider a worldwide ban on the ivory trade next month. <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>'s 14-year-old civil war has made it virtually impossible to stop poaching in the southern part of the country. <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> allows a limited legal trade in ivory. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Botswana </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Zimbabwe </LOCATION> hold similar positions, saying properly managed ivory sales allow them to keep the elephant population under control and generate revenue for conservation programs.

 Evangelist Oral <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> had a dream after talking to God in the desert: a hospital complex where Christians could receive medical treatment and bedside prayer. But now he's shutting it down `` However spiritual one is, you can not do anything without money,'' he said last week. But the cutbacks could save the 4,300-student Oral <ORGANIZATION> Roberts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> and other components of his ministry. <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> had raised the money to pay for his 400-acre religious empire in cash. He built the $ 150 million City of Faith medical complex without a mortgage, funded $ 8 million in medical school scholarships for two years, and paid $ 11 million in past-due accounts earlier this year. At its height, the south <LOCATION> Tulsa </LOCATION> ministry he founded 25 years ago was a $ 500 million operation. But donations from the faithful have fallen with each national headline about wayward preachers, <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> said. Since the 1987 scandals of <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>, <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON>' ministry has seen a drop in monthly donations from $ 5 million to just over $ 2 million. `` I do n't know why it's happened,'' <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> said. `` I guess life just seems to be what it is.'' It was the first time in <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON>' 41-year evangelical career that he publicly acknowledged that expecting a miracle, the theme of his ministry, is not always enough. The 71-year-old faith-healer said he received his vision about the medical complex during a 1977 conversation with God in a <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> desert, and was assured three years later by a 900-foot <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> that his dream soon would come true. Last week, the minister who earned his reputation as a traveling tent preacher offering salvation and healing gave up part of that dream. He said he was closing his City of Faith hospital and the 147-student medical school, and selling his home _ valued at $ 500,000 in 1987 _ and other ministry-owned property to pay off $ 25 million in debts. `` It was a tremendous undertaking,'' <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> conceded. `` Medical education is far different from any other form of education I've ever been associated with. But <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> does not see it as a failure. `` I do n't think it's as bad a day as it seems. I think we'll look back on this and think it's the right thing,'' he said. In fact, <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> seemed almost relieved as he told reporters about his plans to prune his ministry. `` Looking back now that it's made, I think it's one of the best decisions I've ever made.'' <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> and those who have followed the ministry agree that the cutbacks could work for the better. `` The steps that he is taking to stop the flow of money at his two most expensive points of loss _ the hospital and medical school _ will strengthen financially the university and the ministry,'' <LOCATION> Tulsa </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Rodger </PERSON> <PERSON> Randle </PERSON> said. `` We have a short-term loss, but a strengthened ability to survive in the long term.'' The medical school has been a source of many financial problems for the ministry. In 1987, <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON>' said he had to raise $ 8 million for it or God would `` call me home.'' The hospital, which tapped $ 24 million from the ministry's coffers in its first year of operation in 1981, only recently began covering its own expenses <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> built the hospital with a 777-bed capacity, but state regulators approved only 294 beds, and the highest average occupancy was 148 in 1984. `` I have reason to believe that that hospital itself was not doing that poorly,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Stansbarger </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Tulsa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>. `` One of that hospital's main purposes was to help that medical school. You have to make your choices. His choices were the school's going, so the hospital's going too.'' <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> said he had no choice but to take immediate action. `` We've got to take the religious blinders off our eyes and end our holier-than-thou attitude and realize that we live in a human world and that it takes money to survive,'' <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> told students, faculty and staff Wednesday.

 The 16 members of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> precision helicopter team eagerly swapped war stories and tie tacks with their Soviet competitors at the world helicopter championships, but struck out when they tried to trade car license plates. `` Some guys had these great license plates made up for the team, and wanted to trade, but none of the Soviets owned a car,'' recalled pilot <PERSON> Jon </PERSON> <PERSON> Iseminger </PERSON> with a laugh. Iseminger and his co-pilot and navigator <PERSON> Rudolph </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hobbs </PERSON> took the top individual honors at the competition, held last week outside <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>. Both <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> warrant officers are helicopter instructors based at <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rucker </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ala. </LOCATION>. As part of the seven-team <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> contingent, they came away with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>' third consecutive championship, and a lesson in the men they could possibly face off against should the superpowers ever go to war <PERSON> Hobbs </PERSON>, who admits to being dubbed `` Mushmouth'' by his comrades, acknowledged that when words failed, hand signals often made do. But the business of flying was n't topic No. 1. `` We exchanged war stories, and talked about our ways of life,'' <PERSON> Hobbs </PERSON> said in a telephone interview from <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION> after the competition. `` They did n't speak English very well, but they understood it better.'' Iseminger, who also was the pilot of the winning crew at the last world meet in 1986, said the Soviets `` were a lot more open, a lot more jovial and friendly'' than during previous years, an apparent reflection of Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s new policy of openess toward the West. However, the friendly communication had its limits. Although the military background of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> team was clear _ it was made up of four active <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> teams and three <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> teams _ the Soviets refused to say whether they were currently in the military or not, <PERSON> Iseminger </PERSON> said. The level of competence needed in the contest would not easily be obtained in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> without a military background. The international competition is open to civilians, and 38 crews from six nations participated. The Soviets came in second, the British third, French fourth and West Germans fifth. The competition is a grueling challenge that requires an immense amount of concentration, and precision in navigation, flying and timing. Competitors must fly through four events: a 150-kilometer navigation course; a 80-kilometer course that must begin and end at a specific time with a load dropped off during the exercise; a precision flying event; and a slalom and skill course. For example, during the 80-kilometer test, a crew is handed a packet five minutes before takeoff that contains exact takeoff and arrival times and the course route. Contestants must take off on time, arrive on time and then thread a glass bottle suspended on a 20-foot rope through a hole in a box, without breaking it. The Americans flew the OH-58 Kiowa scout helicopter, used primarily to spot targets for other helicopter gunships on the battlefield. The Soviets used the MI-2, or Hoplite, a utilitarian transport or combat chopper. `` It takes skills, but it really boils down to mental toughness, and who handles pressure best,'' said <PERSON> Iseminger </PERSON>. The pilot, who in his job checks on the capabilities of other pilots, said the testing is useful for a military pilot. `` It's like money in the bank,'' he said. `` You may not need to use these skills everyday, but you know inside yourself that you can use them when you need them.'' <PERSON> Hobbs </PERSON>, who tattled that his winning comrade was known as the `` ice man'' for his cool flying under pressure, said the Soviets appeared to have inferior training, and that he would n't worry about meeting such competitors in a war zone. `` I do n't think so,'' <PERSON> Hobbs </PERSON> said. `` Really, there was just something lacking. They just could n't cut the mustard.''

 Vice President <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> leaves Monday on a four-nation trip to <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>, with stops scheduled in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> where <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military presence is embroiled in congressional and regional controversy. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> also will visit <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> on the trip, which will incorporate trade and human rights themes. He begins the 11-day journey with a brief stop at <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Elmendorf </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> There, accompanied by <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON>, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> plans to focus attention on the status of the cleanup of the Exxon Valdez oil spill. They will meet with fishermen and state and local representatives regarding cleanup progress since the March spill by the <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> tanker that despoiled thousands of miles of pristine shoreline. <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> last week was packing up most of its crews for the winter following a 25-week cleanup effort. Federal officials have insisted the oil company will return next spring to continue the cleanup and <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> will underscore that message. After hearing about the status from the local representatives, he might call for <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> to conduct some winter cleanup efforts, which <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> state officials are planning to do themselves, said one administration official who spoke on condition of anonymity. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s journey to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> comes as uneasiness over the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade deficits with each nation continue to fester. In talks with leaders in those countries, the vice president will urge them to open their markets to reverse the trade imbalance situations, said <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s press secretary, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Beckwith </PERSON>. The vice president, in previewing his trip last week, said he would focus on `` the importance of having non-protectionist policies, the importance of having open markets and access, the importance of having a two-way street when it comes to trade.'' `` There are concerns of the American people about access to Japanese markets, about whether the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is getting a fair shake in the trade relationship,'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said in an interview with foreign journalists. Additionally, in <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, where persistent demonstrations are evidence of a feisty anti-U.S. movement, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> is expected to stress a human rights message. Some <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials have expressed concerns about the recent indictment of opposition leader <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Dae-Jung </PERSON> and two lawmakers on charges of failing to report an associate's secret trip to communist <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. One source said administration concerns center on possible political motivations for the indictments. <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Dae-Jung </PERSON>, a former presidential candidate who heads the largest opposition party, has accused <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s government of trying to undermine his party and he denies any involvement with the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> trip. Asked last week whether he would raise human rights with the <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> government, said he would. `` Democracy and freedom and human rights go together,'' he said. `` I know in my discussions I will be speaking from an ideological and philosophical point of view in those terms.'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> will be greeted in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> by the newly arrived ambassador <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON>, President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s former national security adviser who won <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> confirmation recently after rough hearings into his knowledge of the Iran-Contra affair. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> also figures importantly into <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military strategy, with 43,000 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> personnel stationed there. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is running into congressional roadblocks as he tries to strengthen that presence. Several <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> members have called for reductions in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troop strength, but <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said the administration is `` adamantly opposed'' to any reduction. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> on Friday virtually wiped out the $ 86.3 million <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> requested for new construction at <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bases there. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> had earlier earmarked $ 74.2 million for that purpose, and a compromise remains to be worked out. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> also cut all $ 40.8 million <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> requested for work on its <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> bases, pending upcoming negotiations on a new treaty to replace the one under which the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> leases <ORGANIZATION> Clark </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> and Subic Bay Naval Base. Controversy over the bases is certain to be an issue during <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s visit, at a time when the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> are preparing to start negotiations on renewing the six military base leases that expire in 1991. Many Filipino lawmakers are demanding far higher <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid in return, or a phased withdrawal of American forces. A move is afoot in the <ORGANIZATION> Philippine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> to close the bases. President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>, scheduled to visit the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in November, has refused to say whether she favors keeping the bases, which employ some 70,000 Filipinos. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s visit to <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION> is said by some officials to be an effort to nudge <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> by courting another potential suitor for the base. However, <LOCATION> Malaysian </LOCATION> leaders have indicated they would not want the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bases, and have voiced opposition to the position of <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION> which said it would welcome the bases should <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> eject them. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> is also expected to discuss with <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> allies the volatile political situation in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>, where the shape of the future government is uncertain as <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> withdraws its occupying troops. Efforts, closely watched by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, so far have failed to organize a power sharing by two non-communist resistance groups and the Chinese-backed <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>. In <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> will visit <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>'s space center in <LOCATION> Tsukuba </LOCATION> for discussions on expanding U.S.-Japan space cooperation. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> is a partner in <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION>'s project to develop a space station, and <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, who heads the president's national <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, said he wants to talk about how the relationship `` can move forward and be enhanced.'' He also will be in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> for the conference of the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, an international organization of conservative party leaders, including <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>.

 With problems piling up for President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s reforms, the mood of the Soviet citizenry has taken on a dark edge these days. Public debate now includes such terms as `` coup'' and `` civil war.'' Those once-forbidden words are used only by a minority speaking of distant, undesirable possibilities. But they reflect some of the pessimism in the fifth year of <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s reforms. `` It has now become obvious that our 70-year experiment has ended in failure,'' says <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Tikhonov </PERSON>. Far from being a dissident, <PERSON> Tikhonov </PERSON> is a scholar, a parliamentarian, and the first president of the new <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cooperatives </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Semenchenko </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Tallinn </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION>, expressed his fears this way in a letter published Sept. 8 by the newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industry </ORGANIZATION>: `` Ethnic hostility threatens to spill over into civil war. What have we come to: A crisis in the economy, increase in organized crime, a drop in the authority of the party and the Komsomol -LRB- the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> youth group -RRB-.'' Communist maverick <PERSON> Boris </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON>, touring the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, said Monday that <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> has six months to a year to make some progress or face the possibility of revolution. <PERSON> Andrei </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON>, nuclear physicist, Nobel Peace Prize laureate and parliamentarian, wrote in the July 30 edition of the weekly <PERSON> Ogonyok </PERSON> that in Soviet society now `` any ... tragic, horrible thing is possible. `` I think a military coup is possible in such a situation,'' he wrote. `` A right-wing coup is also possible.'' Indeed, problems keep piling up for <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> _ ethnic violence, strikes sweeping the country, empth store shelves, a next-to-worthless currency. Even optimists such as economist <PERSON> Abel </PERSON> <PERSON> Aganbegyan </PERSON> say it will be three years before the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> can regularly stock store shelves with basics such as detergent. <PERSON> Tikhonov </PERSON>, for one, is much more pessimistic. `` The only thing we can expect out of this system is ruins, and on these ruins we have to create something new,'' he said in an <PERSON> Ogonyok </PERSON> interview published Sept. 3. `` This period will take a quarter-century, not less, from the moment we start real reconstruction of the system. And we have n't started yet,'' he said. Soviets watched their television intently this summer when the first <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deputies </ORGANIZATION> and a revamped Supreme Soviet met. The bodies took on a raft of much-needed legislation but often fell into public bickering and disorganization on nationwide television. A new session opens Sept. 25, with the pressure on to act more like a parliament and less like a debating society. The <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> next week convenes a long-delayed meeting to discuss deteriorating ethnic relations. Some members of the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> intelligentsia say that after several years of increasingly grim accounts of the Soviet past and what's in store for the future, they yearn for simple, light-hearted stories on film and in magazines to buoy their spirits. The only thing that seems secure is the one thing <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> has been able to tackle directly: his place as president and <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief. The Soviet leader appears to be solidly entrenched in the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION>, able to ride out coal strikes and ethnic violence alike without challenges to his supremacy. Those who warn of the possibility of civil war or a coup do so by way of warning what will happen if <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> fails rather than making any appeal to replace the Soviet leader. But it was a somber <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> who appeared on television last week, assuring Soviets he was back in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> after summer vacation and steering a firm course between both left and right. `` One can hear in this discordant choir, voices predicting imminent chaos and speculation about the threat of a coup and even civil war,'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said. `` It is a fact that some people would like to create an atmosphere of anxiety, despair and uncertainty in society.'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> has spent much of his time in power trying to spur Soviet citizens into political action after years of passivity. Now that they've begun to act, they are more difficult to manage. But <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> still said the increased political activity was good because it helped overcome years of alienation. `` The community is casting off illusions,'' he said. `` It no longer believes that there are simple solutions to be brought ready-made from above for all our problems.'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> himself has said that reforming Soviet society is more difficult that it first appeared. And the Soviet leader reminded a society that he says has largely forgotten how to work, that they have to do more than just talk. `` We live the way we work, no better and no worse, it is said more and more often. I want to add only one thing, that tomorrow, too, we shall live exactly the way we work,'' he said.

^IRA Tax Breaks Help Savings Rate, Bentsen Study Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JENNIFER DIXON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> savings rate fell sharply after <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> slashed tax deductions for most individual retirement accounts, according to a congressional study released Saturday by Sen. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, has called for restoring partial tax deductions on contributions to IRAs instead of cutting the capital gains tax. He said the new study shows their effectiveness in promoting savings. `` Now if we're going to be less dependent on foreign investment and foreign loaning of money to us, then we have to increase the savings rate in this country,'' said <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said the study found that after 1986, when use of the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> was severely curtailed by cutting back on the tax deductions, `` savings rates dropped substantially in this country _ and they were already low _ and that in addition the IRAs themselves were cut almost in half.'' The study, by an economist for the <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, found `` the weight of evidence suggests that IRAs generate savings which otherwise would not occur, although the precise net increase remains controversial.'' The study said the personal savings rate averaged 5.3 percent of disposable income from 1982-86 and has averaged 3.7 percent since then. The rate fell to 3.2 percent in 1987-1988, the lowest in 40 years, according to the study. Savers contributed $ 38 billion to IRAs in 1986, but the amount fell to almost half that the following year, the study said. The congressional study also mentions analyses by professors <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Venti </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Dartmouth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Wise </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, that suggest net national savings is increased by an amount up to one-half the size of total <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> deposits. `` If true, then IRAs could play a productive role as a complement to deficit reduction in efforts to boost <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> savings, investment and productivity,'' the congressional study said. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> has proposed a deduction of at least 50 percent for all <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> accounts. His plan would allow the withdrawal of <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> funds without penalty at the time of retirement, for a down payment on the purchase of a first home, or to finance college costs. `` That would help us bring interest rates down in his country, that kind of an increased savings,'' said <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>. `` That would make us much more competitive and slow down some of the consumer binge in this country. It would help us with our trade deficit.'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> argues his plan would have a much broader base of support and would go farther in pulling interest rates down, and in increasing productivity and investment, than a cut in capital gains. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is pressing for a cut in taxes on profits from the sale of stocks, real estate and other investments. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Means </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, over the objections of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Democratic leadership, voted Thursday for the capital gains cut.

<HEAD>Government Prepares Emergency Plan to Slash Deficit</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARK J. PORUBCANSKY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The Soviet government has prepared an emergency 1990 budget aimed at cutting the deficit in half within a year and slashing capital spending to improve supplies of consumer goods. But the budget, to be introduced to the Supreme Soviet legislature, already is coming under attack by at least one leading reform-minded economist who says parts of it are too austere. Committees begin work Monday and the budget will be submitted to the full legislature when it goes back to work a week later. The 1990 budget will seek to cut the deficit from $ 192 billion to $ 96 billion, the <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> news agency reported Saturday. The plan calls for slashing spending on new factories and production equipment by 30 percent while calling for an ambitious 6.7 percent increase in production of consumer goods, the <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> report indicated. Some of the country's most radical economists say many economic problems are based in the decades-old practice of setting high production targets that are not feasible and ignore the quality of the goods produced. Other legislation will call for the establishment of a Soviet securities market, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. But the report gave no details on that or actual figures included in the budget. In a nationwide television speech Sept. 9, President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said the government's program to work out of the deficit, consumer shortages and other economic ills `` may include unpopular, probably tough and even painful measures.'' He said the government led by Premier <PERSON> Nikolai </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ryzkhov </PERSON> would have to come up with a practical plan to eliminate consumer shortages that now encompass sugar, soap, meat, cigarettes and many other basic items. Many cities are rationing such items in an effort to halt hoarding. It was only a year ago that Soviet officials announced for the first time the country had any kind of budget deficit, and the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> passed a budget with a $ 58 billion deficit in a budget of almost $ 800 billion. However, much of the deficit was hidden by accounting tricks, and estimates of the 1989 budget deficit quickly mushroomed. One leading economist, <PERSON> Abel </PERSON> <PERSON> Aganbegyan </PERSON>, said in an article in the September issue of the monthly <ORGANIZATION> Government </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION> that the plan to cut $ 153.8 billion in capital outlays by 30 percent is too severe. `` Speaking honestly the proposal ... frightens me,'' he wrote. `` I think this could lead to extremely negative consequences. You ca n't go from one extreme to the other.'' Soviet budgets for years have been burdened by huge outlays for new factories, buildings and equipment at the expense of basic consumer goods. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and his economic advisers now say much of the equipment and many of the buildings were unnecesary in the first place, and are operating inefficiently if at all. But <PERSON> Aganbegyan </PERSON>, an adviser to <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, said the 1990 budget plan goes too far in cutting those expenditures. The Ministry of Oil and Gas Construction, for example, is planning to freeze millions of rubles worth of construction equipment and thousands of miles of pipeline and discharge 76,000 highly qualified workers, he wrote. The economist said the capital budget should be cut by about 20 percent, with $ 8 billion set aside to help Soviets finance private housing construction. The other $ 24 billion should be used to increase public housing construction, the number of private garden plots and family resorts, and set up a program to help consumers buy highly sought-after items such as cars, video equipment and personal computers, he said. The budget is likely to come under tough scrutiny by Supreme Soviet committees, which under the new government structure instituted this year have become much more critical of government programs.

<TEXT>
 Syrian and Christian gunners skirmished with mortars and machine guns around <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> on Saturday, ignoring an urgent plea by the Arab League for an immediate end to the bloodshed. Police said at least 12 people were wounded in sporadic clashes that continued hours after an Arab League mediation committee issued its latest call for a truce and said it is sending an envoy Sunday to implement a peace plan. A police spokesman, who by custom is not named, said he doubts the fighting will abate before the arrival of the delegate, Algerian diplomat <PERSON> Lakhdar </PERSON> <PERSON> Ibrahimi </PERSON>. A source at Christian Gen. <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s army command accused the Syrians of `` maintaining the provocative firing against our positions.'' `` Our officers have strict orders to practice maximum self-restraint. But they ca n't sit and watch others attacking them without defending themselves,'' the source said on condition of anonymity. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> did not immediately comment on the truce call, which was welcomed by his chief rival, acting Prime Minister <PERSON> Salim </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoss </PERSON>. `` This is a chance to end the crisis that might not be repeated,'' the Sunni Moslem leader said in a statement. <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> also welcomed the truce call and urged `` all Lebanese parties'' to cooperate with the <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> envoy, according to the official <ORGANIZATION> Syrian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>. `` The Syrian government is convinced that the implementation of these security measures will lead to preventing bloodshed and will pave the way to solving the <LOCATION> Lebanese </LOCATION> crisis,'' it quoted an unidentified official as saying. In the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, the call was praised by the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration and <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Secretary-General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON>. The White House welcomed the declaration as `` a constructive basis upon which all parties to the conflict in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> can engage in a political process devoid of violence and coercion.'' White House Press Secretary <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said the administration plans to restaff its embassy in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> as soon as its diplomats `` can be reasonably safe and effective.'' <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> evacuated its 30 diplomats in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> on Sept. 5 after <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> reportedly threatened to take Americans hostage. The Maronite Catholic general denied making such a threat. He has accused <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> of favoring <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>, saying any action against that nation could harm eight Americans held by Iranian-backed Shiite Moslem groups in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> is <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s main ally and has pledged to help free the Americans, among 16 Westerners missing in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>, who is armed by <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, has vowed to drive <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>'s 40,000 troops from <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, charging they have betrayed an <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> peacekeeping mandate by siding with the Moslems. <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> wants to link any pullout to a withdrawal of Israeli troops in southern <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, Moslem and <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> radio stations interrupted regular programming with reports of the cease-fire call, which followed a night of ferocious shelling duels in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> and the surrounding mountains that killed 12 people and wounded 72. At least 914 people have been killed and 2,697 have been wounded in the 6-month-old artillery war between <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s forces and Syrian soldiers. `` There can be no solution to the <LOCATION> Lebanese </LOCATION> crisis by military means,'' said a communique issued in <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Morocco </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>, whose leaders make up the mediation committee. The statement said the cease-fire call is meant to `` stop the bloodshed and establish an atmosphere conducive to assuring the return of security, stability and national reconciliation.'' It called on all parties to stop supplying weapons to the combatants in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> and said it already has received `` positive responses in this regard.'' It said a <LOCATION> Lebanese </LOCATION> security committee would be set up under Ibrahimi to supervise implementation of the cease-fire and monitor ships reported to be carrying weapons, or ammunition. Blockades, imposed by the Syrians on the 310-square-mile Christian enclave and by <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> on illegal ports run by <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>'s militia allies south of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, would be lifted as soon as the security committee began its work, the statement said The <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> committee called for a meeting of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s parliament on Sept. 30 at a location to be decided later to `` discuss and prepare'' political reforms The committee comprises King Fahd of <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>, <PERSON> King </PERSON> <PERSON> Hassan </PERSON> II of <LOCATION> Morocco </LOCATION> and Algerian President <PERSON> Chadli </PERSON> <PERSON> Bendjedid </PERSON>. Saturday's call for a halt to the fighting is the latest of many that have gone unanswered.

 At least 31 of the 54 dams operated by the <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Indian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> pose a serious threat to life and property, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s inspector general. The report of Inspector General <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Richards </PERSON> said the dams, all on Indians lands in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION>, are either in `` poor'' or `` unsatisfactory'' condition as a result of inadequate maintenance by the <ORGANIZATION> BIA </ORGANIZATION>. `` These unsafe dams, which pose a serious threat to hundreds of lives and surrounding property, could potentially cost hundreds of millions of dollars to repair,'' <PERSON> Richards </PERSON> wrote in a letter to <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Lujan </PERSON>. The report, released publicly over the weekend, has already been seen by <PERSON> Lujan </PERSON>, who has instructed Assistant Secretary for Indian Affairs <PERSON> Eddie </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> `` to take a look and take the necessary actions to have those dams repaired or maintained in proper order,'' <ORGANIZATION> BIA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Shaw </PERSON> said Saturday. Assistant Inspector General <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Bloom </PERSON> wrote in the report: `` These dams have safety deficiencies, including serious problems with excessive seepage and embankment erosion, that are worsening each year because of a lack of maintenance. Most could not withstand a major flood, and, as a result are imminent threats to rural communities downstream.'' Among the worst examples, said <PERSON> Bloom </PERSON>, are the <LOCATION> Ganado </LOCATION>, Round Rock and Many Farms dams in <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>, the <PERSON> Pablo </PERSON> and Lower Dry Fork dams in <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Ponca </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dam </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>. Failure of the Pablo Dam, the largest in the Flathead Indian Irrigation Project in <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>, could cause `` considerable loss of life _ potentially 400 people _ and excessive economic loss in the towns of <PERSON> Pablo </PERSON>, <PERSON> Dunham </PERSON> and adjacent subdivisions,'' <PERSON> Bloom </PERSON> said. His report noted that the <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineers </ORGANIZATION>, in a 1988 study on flood control on the <LOCATION> Navajo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Reservation </LOCATION>, said of <LOCATION> Ganado </LOCATION> and six other dams in the area: `` It is virtually certain that these unsafe and often undersized dams will fail during a major storm.'' The 31 dams, most of which are not listed by state in report, are: <LOCATION> Ganado </LOCATION>, Black Rock, <ORGANIZATION> McDonald </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Lower </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fork </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Dulce </PERSON>, <PERSON> Rosebud </PERSON>, Round Rock, <PERSON> Jocko </PERSON>, <PERSON> Weber </PERSON>, Acomita, <LOCATION> Crow </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Creek </LOCATION>, Standing Rock No. 1, Many Farms, <LOCATION> Oglala </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Tufa </PERSON> <PERSON> Stone </PERSON>, <PERSON> Pablo </PERSON>, He Dog, Picacho, <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lake </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Parmelee </PERSON>, White Clay, <LOCATION> Washakie </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bonneau </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Ponca </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Crow </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ana </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Tabor </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Tsaile </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Coolidge </PERSON>, <PERSON> Asaayi </PERSON>, <PERSON> Elgo </PERSON>.

 The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration on Saturday welcomed the call by an <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> committee for a cease-fire in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> and said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> diplomats will be returned to <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> as soon as their safety can be assured. The White House, in a statement by Press Secretary <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>, praised the communique from the <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> tripartite committee which called for a halt to the fighting and an end to port blockades, as well as a Sept. 30 date to begin national reconciliation talks by <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s parliament. `` These are essential first steps on the path to restoring a strong central governent in control of all of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s territory and to achieving the withdrawal of all foreign forces, objectives we all share,'' said the statement from <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>. `` We call upon all parties to stop the fighting, lift the blockades and allow the process of reconcilation to begin,'' it said. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, spending the weekend at the presidential retreat in Camp <PERSON> David </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, with his wife and friends, was in contact with his staff on the <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> situation. He has been engaged in meetings and contacts with foreign leaders on the matter, aides said. The White House used the occasion Saturday to open the door for a return of Ambassdor <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON> and the embassy staff to <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. The diplomats were evacuated Sept. 6 after Christian youths loyal to the government of Gen. <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>, besieged the embassy compound. `` The evacuation of our embassy from <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> should not be misread,'' the Fitzwater statement read. `` Our temporary absence does not mean we are indifferent to the safety and welfare of the people of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. `` Indeed we redoubled our efforts with the <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> to press for a cease-fire and the beginning of a political process to bring an end to the suffering in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. `` Rest assured, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will return its diplomats to <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> as expeditiously as we are convinced that circumstances exist in which our presence can be reasonably safe and effective.'' The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will engage in talks with <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s government on the security assurances it would require before they return, said an administration official who spoke on condition of anonymity. Sources in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> said <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> considered the departure a move directed against his rule. <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials have said they considered <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s own earlier comments threats on Americans. He had said in an interview that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was obsessed with freeing Americans held hostage in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, and indicated perhaps the way to get the attention of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was to take American hostages. The declaration Saturday by the foreign ministers of <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Morocco </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION>, who make up the <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> committee, was viewed by the administration as `` a clear step in the right direction,'' said the administration source. Previous similar calls have failed to end the violence pitting Syrian troops and allied Moslem militias against the mainly Christian troops of <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>. But the setting of a Sept. 30 negotiation date, and pledges about restricting arms supplies indicated the effort was `` reasonably serious'' and pragmatic and may have potential, the official added. The Arab League, founded in 1945, is the chief representative of <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> interests internationally and mediates disputes among the Arab states.

<HEAD>U.S. Policy Quandary: What to Do When Vietnamese Leave?</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOAN MOWER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Two weeks before Vietnamese troops are to withdraw from <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>, the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration is in a quandary over what it should do to block the resurgence of the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>, a group that murdered up to 2 million people in the 1970s, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and congressional officials say. `` Basically, what's happening is that most people are trying to figure out what to do since <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>,'' said a senior administration official, referring to the collapse of a 19-nation peace conference in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> last month. `` People are trying to absorb what went on,'' the official said, speaking only on condition his name not be used. `` What do we do when, and if, the Vietnamese complete withdrawal?'' Participants at the <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> conference failed to come up with a political solution for easing tension among warring factions in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> after the Vietnamese leave. <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION> has said it will pull its troops out by Sept. 30, ending a 10-year occupation. The vacuum has created the `` very real possibility that the genocidal <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> could battle its way back to power in <LOCATION> Phnom </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Penh </LOCATION>,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Solarz </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee on Asian and Pacific Affairs. <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, an expert on <LOCATION> Indochina </LOCATION> and former scholar at the <ORGANIZATION> Carnegie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Endowment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peace </ORGANIZATION>, a think tank, said the administration is in a `` genuine dilemma'' about <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>. `` In the wake of the <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> conference, there are serious questions'' about <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy, he said. A major concern are the ties between the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> and Prince <PERSON> Norodom </PERSON> <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON>, the former Cambodian monarch the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> supports with millions of dollars in aid. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> would like to see <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON> head an interim government pending free elections supervised by the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>. Although members of <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON>'s family were murdered by the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>, which ruled <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> between 1975-1979, <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON> has endorsed the idea of including the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> in a transitional government in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>. Both the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON> receive military aid from <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. Other factions in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> are the Vietnamese-backed government of <PERSON> Hun </PERSON> <PERSON> Sen </PERSON>, and a smaller non-communist faction. Some observers at the <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> conference said <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON> abdicated too much of his authority to the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>. `` Is he every going to loosen himself from the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>?'' <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> asked. `` Nobody can come up with a leader to replace <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON>.'' Vice President <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, who is expected to discuss the Cambodian situation with <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> allies on a trip to the <LOCATION> Far </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> this week, told a group of reporters last week that `` the non-communist resistance has always been, from our viewpoint, the best hope to see a political settlement occur in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>.'' Members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> echoed concern about <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON>. `` I think we ought to make clear to <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON> that either he and the non-communists break all their ties to the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>, or they do n't get any help from us,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Chester </PERSON> <PERSON> Atkins </PERSON>, D-Mass. Rep. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Leach </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Iowa </LOCATION>, suggested <PERSON> Pol </PERSON> <PERSON> Pot </PERSON> be brought before an international tribunal on charges of genocide. He said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> should not go along with <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON>'s apparent acquiescence on the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>. `` The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> does not have the luxury of recusing itself'' on moral issues,'' he said. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration says its adamantly opposes a return to power of the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>, an extreme nationalist group with about 40,000 fighters. `` We want to ensure that there are not more Cambodian killing fields,'' said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Solomon </PERSON>, assistant secretary of state for <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> affairs. At the same time, <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Boucher </PERSON> said the administration has noted that <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON> as well as <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> allies have `` said that the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> elements should participate in the political process. <PERSON> Atkins </PERSON> claimed administration officials used `` the most twisted and distorted logic that I've ever seen in foreign policy'' in defending a policy that opposes the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> while seeming to go along with <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON>'s idea of including it in the government. But <PERSON> Solomon </PERSON> said on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> last week that it would be `` self-delusional'' to ignore the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>, a force to be reckoned with in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>. And one administration official explained the dilemma. Excluding the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> means the rebels assuredly would launch a military offensive to seize power, creating a `` little <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Southeast </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>,'' he said. By bringing some <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> `` under the tent, there's a possibility that peace will break out,'' he said. As <PERSON> Solomon </PERSON> put it: `` The chances of avoiding conflict are not very good,'' but they are better with a political settlement. Complicating the situation are the Soviets and the Chinese. <PERSON> Solomon </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> believes <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> has stepped up arms shipments to the <PERSON> Hun </PERSON> <PERSON> Sen </PERSON> regime in recent months. `` The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, as a primary supporter of <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Hun </PERSON> <PERSON> Sen </PERSON>, must restrict its increasing flow of arms into <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>,'' he said. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> is likely to broach the issue in talks with Soviet Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> later this month. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> also wants <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> to end its arms supplies to the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>. Meantime, the administration has asked <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> _ and received approval _ to spend about $ 7.5 million in humanitarian aid for <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> in fiscal 1990, up about $ 2.5 million from the previous year. But sources on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration have not requested any covert assistance for military equipment in the upcoming fiscal year. The sources spoke on condition of anonymity.

 Princess <PERSON> Diana </PERSON>'s brother and his bride exchanged wedding vows Saturday in a church where some of <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Washington </PERSON>'s ancestors are buried. The marriage of <PERSON> Viscount </PERSON> <PERSON> Althorp </PERSON> and former model <PERSON> Victoria </PERSON> <PERSON> Lockwood </PERSON> had been proclaimed `` the nearly royal wedding of the year'' by The <ORGANIZATION> Sunday </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> London </ORGANIZATION>. The bride wore the <PERSON> Spencer </PERSON> family tiara that <PERSON> Diana </PERSON> wore when she married Prince <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> in 1981. Like <PERSON> Diana </PERSON>'s, the wedding was conducted by the archbishop of <ORGANIZATION> Canterbury </ORGANIZATION>, the Most Rev. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Runcie </PERSON> _ `` a very nice man,'' in the opinion of the eighth <PERSON> Earl </PERSON> <PERSON> Spencer </PERSON>, father of the groom, whose comments were included in a packet of press material on the ceremony. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> and <PERSON> Diana </PERSON> were among the guests, and their second son, five-year-old Prince <PERSON> Harry </PERSON>, was a page. Security, in deference to the royals, was strict, and villagers needed red tickets to be admitted to an enclosure near the church. Unlike the royal wedding in the vast <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Paul </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cathedral </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, Saturday's ceremony was crammed into the medieval <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mary </ORGANIZATION> the Virgin, two miles from the family seat of <LOCATION> Althorp </LOCATION>. Six pews were removed to make room for an orchestra and a choir, leaving space for about 250 guests. Another 200 people were invited for champagne and a light supper afterwards at the family house. The estate stands in <LOCATION> Northamptonshire </LOCATION> amid rolling pastures where sheep and cattle graze among the hedgerows. <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Cartland </PERSON>, 88-year-old queen of romance novelists and mother of the earl's second wife, arrived in a hot pink chiffon dress and hat. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Althorp </PERSON>, 25, who is a reporter for <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Today'' Show, is in line to become the ninth Earl and inherit an estimated $ 80 million fortune, including the <LOCATION> Althorp </LOCATION> estate. Miss <PERSON> Lockwood </PERSON>, 24, a former fashion model, became engaged to <LOCATION> Althorp </LOCATION> in July following a six-week romance. <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mary </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION>, with its tall beacon tower, has been the church of the <PERSON> Spencer </PERSON> family _ Princess <PERSON> Diana </PERSON>'s family _ since 1508 when Sir <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Spencer </PERSON> bought the 15,000-acre <LOCATION> Althorp </LOCATION> estate. <PERSON> Laurence </PERSON> <PERSON> Washington </PERSON>, the great-great-great-grandfather of the first American president, was a cousin by marriage of the <ORGANIZATION> Spencers </ORGANIZATION> and lived on the estate until he died in December 1616 and was buried in the chancel near the church altar. <PERSON> Laurence </PERSON>'s younger brother, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON>, also is buried in the church. Their tombstones bear the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> coat of arms with three stars over two horizontal bars. It is thought to have inspired the design of the American flag. As promised last week, church officials took up a collection from among the assembled journalists to raise money to help restore the church. There was no word on how much was raised. Church officials say they need $ 190,000 to preserve the church, which overlooks the thatched roofs and farmlands of <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Brington </LOCATION>, 66 miles northwest of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. Several hundred people, fortified by picnic baskets and thermoses, staked out places near the church despite a drenching rain. `` It's the wedding of the year,'' said <PERSON> Emily </PERSON> <PERSON> Coghlan </PERSON>, 64, an onlooker who deployed her lawn chair in front of the church at 7 a.m., eight hours before the ceremony.

 Gunmen rampaged through three villages in central <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>, burning and shooting to death at least 82 Sinhalese civilians in repeated night raids, residents and military officials said Saturday. An army officer said the killers are believed to be pro-government vigilantes seeking vengeance for the deaths of 15 soldiers' relatives killed by radicals of the <ORGANIZATION> Sinhalese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> The gunmen wore military-style uniforms, he said. They started the massacre Thursday in <LOCATION> Menikhinna </LOCATION> village, 55 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION>, according to military officials who spoke on condition of anonymity. At least 50 houses in the village were torched Thursday and Friday night, said the officials. Searchers have found 52 bodies as of Saturday, some with gunshot wounds and others burned, they said. The raiders also attacked neigboring <LOCATION> Kundasala </LOCATION> and Aranagala villages and killed 30 people, they said. The villagers were unarmed, according to the officials. Residents in <LOCATION> Kandy </LOCATION>, a few miles from <LOCATION> Menikhinna </LOCATION>, said at least 100 bodies have been found in the three villages, and at least 50 more people may have been killed and thrown into a nearby river. The residents were contacted by telephone and refused to identify themselves. <PERSON> Menikhinna </PERSON> is believed to be a stronghold of the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, an ultranationalist guerrilla group trying to overthrow the government The massacre is the worst committed by a suspected vigilante group. On Sept. 1 suspected vigilantes shot or burned to death at least 60 Sinhalese at <LOCATION> Punewa </LOCATION> village, 120 miles north of <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION>, apparently to avenge the slaying of a police inspector. Government officials deny opposition charges that they give orders to vigilantes. The army is pursuing its own crackdown on the radicals. Military officials said Saturday that soldiers shot 11 Sinhalese radicals and arrested 226 others in central and southern <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION> in the preceding 24 hours. Also, militants killed six Sinhalese civilians in three separate attacks Friday, they said. By official count, at least 5,000 people have died in the 2-year-old Sinhalese revolt. The radicals began fighting to protest government concessions to minority Tamils fighting another war for an independent homeland in northeastern <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>. Sinhalese radicals also resent the deployment of <LOCATION> Indian </LOCATION> peacekeeping soldiers supervising a peace accord with the Tamils. Tamils make up 18 percent of <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>'s 16 million people and charge they are discriminated against by the majority Sinhalese who control the government and military.

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> urged the Baltic republics to compromise with their minorities and settle the region's ethnic disputes, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> reported. The Soviet president spoke at a meeting with <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and government leaders from <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Latvia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> released its report on the Wednesday meeting late Friday. `` All our problems should be tackled by joint effort in the framework of the federation,'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said. All the country's 15 republics are tied together economically, culturally and through human contacts, he said. `` If we now allowed the situation to deteriorate to the point where these ties would start to break up, the republics and the whole country would be rolled back by decades,'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said. He added that `` any attempt to infringe on citizens' rights on the ethnic basis should be regarded as contradicting the principles of Soviet statehood and humanism.'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s social reforms, including greater tolerance of dissent, has fueled a wave of nationalism in the <ORGANIZATION> Baltics </ORGANIZATION> and other Soviet republics. The Baltics are seeking greater autonomy and freedom from Kremlin control. But the growing nationalism also has heightened tensions among ethnic Russians and other minority groups who live and work in those republics, and who claim they are targets of discrimination by the ethnic majority. Non-Estonian workers in that republic struck last month after the Estonian government passed rough residency requirements for voting and running for local office. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s conciliatory tone comes after the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> last month warned that separatists were leading the Baltic republics into an abyss. Estonian radio editor <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Tiido </PERSON> said Friday that in interviews given when he returned to <LOCATION> Tallinn </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Estonian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Vaino </PERSON> <PERSON> Vyalyas </PERSON> said <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> spoke favorably about the republics' plans for more economic autonomy More than a million Baltic residents joined hands on Aug. 23 to protest the 50th anniversary of a Nazi-Soviet agreement that paved the way for <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> to annex the Baltic states.

 A doctor treating <PERSON> Mother </PERSON> <PERSON> Teresa </PERSON> for a heart attack said Saturday the Nobel laureate is responding to treatment and that the cause of an infection that slowed her recovery has been found. Doctors said last week that the infection posed a new danger to the 79-year-old Nobel laureate, who has been hospitalized nearly two weeks. `` We have found one or two causes for the infection. We are hopeful that now she will improve faster,'' said Dr. A.K. <PERSON> Bardhan </PERSON>. The doctor refused to reveal the cause of the infection. The Woodlands Nursing Home hospital said <PERSON> Mother </PERSON> <PERSON> Teresa </PERSON>'s temperature was normal and `` her general condition is better.

 East Germans by the hundreds crossed into <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION> on Saturday, afraid that their historic opportunity to emigrate might soon be lost. But the Hungarian premier said the border would remain open. Premier <PERSON> Miklos </PERSON> <PERSON> Nemeth </PERSON> was quoted by a West German newspaper as saying that concern for human rights had dictated his country's decision to defy its <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pact </ORGANIZATION> ally, <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> Using Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s concept of a `` European House'' where East and West cooperate, <PERSON> Nemeth </PERSON> was quoted as telling <ORGANIZATION> Bild </ORGANIZATION> am <PERSON> Sontag </PERSON>: `` There can be no rooms in such a house that are separated by barbed wire.'' An estimated 14,000 East Germans have traveled to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> since <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> threw open its western border with <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION> on Sept. 10. East Germans, who have automatic West German citizenship, have been drawn by the promise of a brighter economic future in the West. <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> had insisted its approval of the East German exodus is temporary but has not said when it would close its border. <PERSON> Nemeth </PERSON> was quoted as saying that the border would remain open but did not say for how long. <PERSON> Ferenc </PERSON> <PERSON> Somogyi </PERSON>, one of <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s three deputy foreign ministers, also said Friday his government had no immediate plans to halt the westward flow. Border officials in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> said 500 East Germans had made their way to registration points in <LOCATION> Bavaria </LOCATION> during the night Friday. In <LOCATION> Budapest </LOCATION>, workers of the West German charity registering new arrivals at refugee camps said about 400 East Germans had gathered between late Friday and noon Saturday. That is nearly double the average in the last few days. The workers, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the refugees continued to fear that the border might close and their opportunity to emigrate would end. Many East Germans waiting at the Zugliget transit camp for buses to take them to the West expressed anxiety. `` Grab the chance while you can, you never know how long you have,'' said a burly man from <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>, cradling a two-year old toddler in his arms. `` I could never live with myself if I missed the opportunity because I waited too long.'' East Germans began crossing the border into <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION> after <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> began removing boundary fortifications in May, a reflection of its desire for stronger ties to the West. It also has been implementing reforms that put it, along with <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, at the forefront of change in the Soviet bloc. Foreign Minister <PERSON> Gyula </PERSON> <PERSON> Horn </PERSON> sought to head off speculation that <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s reforms and tensions with allies might lead it out of the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact. `` As long as this bloc exists, <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> will continue to carry out its responsibilities in it,'' <PERSON> Horn </PERSON> told a <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> rally in <LOCATION> Komarom </LOCATION>, on the Czechoslovak border. In July, thousands of the estimated 50,000 East Germans vacationing in <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> refused to return home. <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> began putting them up in emergency shelters. Then, seven days ago, <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> threw open its border and allowed the biggest single exodus West since the <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> Wall was built in 1961. Hard-line <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> have sharply criticized their <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact ally's role in the refugee exodus. Romanian President <PERSON> Nicolae </PERSON> <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON> on Friday accused <LOCATION> Budapest </LOCATION> of `` irresponsible actions'' and called for `` interference in other countries' home affairs to stop,'' the state Agerpres news agency reported. On Saturday, the Soviets lashed out at <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. A front-page article in the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> daily <ORGANIZATION> Pravda </ORGANIZATION> said `` It's completely obvious that the carrying out of a huge provocative action against <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> is an open violation of international law.'' Pravda also accused the West German press of whipping up enthusiasm among the refugees to emigrate. The Czechoslovak <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> daily Rude Pravo also assailed <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, accusing that government of having `` coordinated'' the exodus and saying <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION> authorities were `` unable to hide their hatred of socialism.'' <LOCATION> Communist </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> kept up its bitter criticism of <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION> Saturday. `` We are experiencing now a pitiless psychological warfare against socialism,'' read a commentary in the Berliner Zeitung newspaper. The state-run news agency ADN alleged that the recruitment of East German workers amounted to `` slave trade.'' In a twist to the refugee story, an Italian newspaper said Saturday that several hundred unemployed Italians are seeking permission to live and work in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. The Rome-based daily Il Tempo said a delegation representing 264 unemployed people from <LOCATION> Naples </LOCATION> went to the <ORGANIZATION> East </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> German </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> Friday to deliver documents asking for permission to move to the Communist country, where they were certain they would be able to find a secure job and an inexpensive place to live.

 An Arab League committee called Saturday for an `` immediate and comprehensive'' cease-fire in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, but admitted it has no power to enforce the appeal. `` The Lebanese crisis will not be resolved by military means,'' <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> Foreign Minister Prince <PERSON> Saud </PERSON> <PERSON> al-Faisal </PERSON> read from the declaration of the <ORGANIZATION> Tripartite </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> comprising <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>'s King Fahd, Moroccan King <PERSON> Hassan </PERSON> II and Algerian President <PERSON> Chadli </PERSON> <PERSON> Bendjedid </PERSON>. It said the cease-fire is necessary `` to stop the bloodshed and establish an atmosphere conducive to assuring the return of security, stability and national reconciliation.'' The call followed a night of savage shelling duels in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> that killed 12 people and wounded 72 others. <PERSON> Saud </PERSON> could offer no guarantee for the success of this latest in a string of cease-fire efforts by the 22-member <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION>. `` The committee possesses no weapons with which it would impose its will in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Saud </PERSON> said. But he said <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>, whose troops are battling the Christians in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, supports the new peace plan. The declaration called on all parties to stop supplying weapons to the combatants and said the committee already has received `` positive responses in this regard.'' <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> has been arming the Christians. <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> backs <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s Moslems, who want a bigger share of power in the country traditionally dominated by the minority Christians A `` Lebanese <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>'' to be headed by Algerian diplomat <PERSON> Lakhdar </PERSON> will implement and oversee the cease-fire, monitoring all ships reported to be carrying weapons or ammunition, <PERSON> Saud </PERSON> said. As soon as the security body begins its work, naval blockades would be lifted and <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> reopened, the declaration said. Ibrahimi is expected in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> on Sunday and also is to negotiate the location of a Sept. 30 meeting of the Lebanese parliament `` to discuss and prepare the National Reconciliation Charter.'' The Arab League has blamed the failure of previous peace efforts mainly on <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>'s refusal to withdraw its 40,000 troops from <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION> wants to link such a pullout to the withdrawal of Israeli troops in southern <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. `` In the final analysis all foreign non-Lebanese forces will have to leave <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Saud </PERSON>.

<HEAD>Delicate Dance Around Race Highlights Virginia Campaign for Governor</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOE TAYLOR</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>RICHMOND, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 After months of delicately dancing around questions about race, <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>'s candidates for governor suddenly were confronted by the issue with the Labor Day rioting by blacks in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>. Democrat <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON> and Republican <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON>, though, have stuck to their caution steps. <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON>, seeking to become the first elected black governor of a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> state, distanced himself last week from any appearance of being sympathetic to the unrest and claims by black leaders of police misconduct in quelling the violence. <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON>, who has said he will not let <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON> use race as a shield to avoid tough questions, has been careful on his part to avoid any comment that could be construed as racially inflammatory. The rioting Sept. 3 and 4 coincided with a fraternity festival that annually draws thousands of students from predominantly black colleges along the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> to the resort city. Rioters looted more than 100 businesses, and police arrested about 220 people. Afterward, many of the students visiting the beach complained that they were harassed by police and sometimes beaten as authorities imposed a curfew after the looting and tried to clear the ocean-front strip. The state <ORGANIZATION> NAACP </ORGANIZATION> chapter has asked Gov. <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baliles </PERSON> to appoint a commission to conduct a state investigation. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> are already reviewing the matter. `` Violence of this type _ of any type _ will not be condoned or tolerated while <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON> is governor,'' <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON> said Monday in a visit to <LOCATION> Norfolk </LOCATION>, just a few miles from <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>. `` I will take whatever measures are necessary to enforce this promise.'' <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON>, the state's lieutenant governor, has been fighting Republican efforts to make him appear soft on crime. He made no mention of the allegations against police. Instead, he supported <PERSON> Baliles </PERSON>, a fellow Democrat who by law can not run for a second consecutive term, in calling out state police and <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> troops as backups for <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> officers during the rioting. <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON> `` is trying to be fair,'' said <PERSON> Laura </PERSON> <PERSON> Dillard </PERSON>, his press secretary. He steered clear of the complaints against police `` because it is still under investigation,'' she said. <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON>, a one-time moderate from the <LOCATION> Shenandoah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> whose 1989 campaign has taken on a more conservative slant, also called <PERSON> Baliles </PERSON>' response `` necessary and appropriate under the circumstances.'' `` Such lawlessness can never be justified or condoned,'' <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> said, adding that he saw nothing racial about the episode. `` Given the volatility of the situation and the intense emotionalism that surrounds it, it is absolutely essential that public officials and private citizens refrain from politicizing this regrettable incident,'' he said. Polls show the two sides about even. In 1977, when <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> won the race for attorney general, he received substantial support from black voters. But <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON> is expected to draw 90 percent or more of the state's minority vote this year, partly because he is black and partly because <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> does not have the advantage, as he did 12 years ago, of having a former segregationist as an opponent <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON>'s law-and-order comments apparently have not hurt his standing among blacks, who comprise 17 percent of the state's population `` What he's saying is consistent with what the <ORGANIZATION> NAACP </ORGANIZATION> has been saying,'' said <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gravely </PERSON>, president of the <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> chapter of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> for the Advancement of Colored People. `` We have condemned the looting. We have condemned the violation of the law,'' Gravely said. `` We do n't feel he's turning his back on us.'' <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Buchanan </PERSON>, a conservative newspaper columnist and one-time aide to former President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, sees the <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> rioting as damaging to <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON>. `` I think this racial violence in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> and the fact that it's been nationalized by the TV media are really going to finish him off in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Buchanan </PERSON> said on a syndicated television program last week. However, <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Morris </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Richmond </ORGANIZATION> political analyst, said neither side can do anything to turn the event to his advantage, particularly <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON>. `` But it was unfortunate for <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON>, because it's a reminder that there are racial tensions in our society lurking below the surface and they can break through at any time,'' he said.

 Activists pledged to expand their anti-apartheid campaign Saturday as they buried victims of election night violence in black and mixed-race townships outside <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION>. Police were present at the four funerals Saturday, but kept a low profile as part of a new government policy not to disrupt peaceful demonstrations and gatherings. `` Death will not deter those struggling for a free <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>,'' the Rev. <PERSON> Lionel </PERSON> <PERSON> Louw </PERSON> told about 4,000 mourners at <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Augustine </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Anglican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> in the mixed-race township of Grassy Park. `` Do you see the blood of our martyrs? Can you hear them speak? These are atrocities committed against our people. We ca n't allow -LRB- police -RRB- brutality and call it law and order any longer,'' <PERSON> Louw </PERSON> said at the service for Pedro Page. Page, 18, was one of at least 23 people of black and mixed-race that activists say were killed the night of Sept. 6 in violence instigated by police. Police gradually have raised their figures in recent days and now say there were 10 deaths in black-on-black faction fighting and nine killings in which police may have been responsible. The mourners traveled two miles from the church to the cemetery, guided by young activists serving as volunteer traffic marshals. The only visible police were traffic officers, and some gave their bright orange vests to the marshals and watched from afar. Asked how he felt about the marshals taking over his job, one mixed-race policeman said, `` I think it's wonderful.'' In the past, police have placed tight restrictions on the funerals of activists and prohibited political speeches at the ceremonies. Two funerals were held in the black township of <LOCATION> Khayelitsha </LOCATION>, and prominent activist Rev. <PERSON> Allan </PERSON> <PERSON> Boesak </PERSON> led a funeral service for 13-year-old <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Muller </PERSON> in the mixed-race township of <LOCATION> Bellville </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Boesak </PERSON> said activists would resume marches on `` whites-only'' beaches beginning Sept. 30 and would extend major protest actions to the southern cities of the eastern <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Province </LOCATION>. He called on the government not to act against a huge anti-apartheid convention set for Oct. 7 in <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION>. The Mass Democratic Movement, a loosely-based anti-apartheid coalition, launched a nationwide campaign of defiance on Aug. 2. The organized demonstrations aimed at segregated schools, hospitals, beaches, buses and other facilities have been peaceful. However, spontaneous clashes have erupted repeatedly between young activists and police, particularly in the townships surrounding <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION>. President-elect F.W. <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON>, in a major policy shift, announced Tuesday that the white-led government would not block peacful protests, which previously had almost always been banned. More than 20,000 people joined a <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION> march Wednesday against police brutality, the largest such demonstration ever authorized by the government. About 15,000 chanting protesters marched through the heart of <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION> and 2,000 took over the central square of the capital, <LOCATION> Pretoria </LOCATION>, on Friday. All the demonstrations have been peaceful and the only reported police action has been against white hecklers. <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON>, who will be sworn in for a five-year term Wednesday, has portrayed himself as a reformer who wants to bring the 28 million black majority into the national government on a limited basis within five years. He has said he wants to begin negotiations with black leaders on a new constitution. But <PERSON> Boesak </PERSON> said conditions for such talks would include lifting the 3-year-old state of emergency, releasing political prisoners such as <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>, and legalizing organizations such as <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> guerrilla movement. <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON> announced Saturday that <PERSON> Gerrit </PERSON> <PERSON> Viljoen </PERSON>, a former minister of black education, will spearhead the negotiations for the government. The Cambridge-educated <PERSON> Viljoen </PERSON>, 63, has a reputation as a bookish, soft-spoken, political moderate close to <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON>. In another development, Law and Order Minister <PERSON> Adriaan </PERSON> <PERSON> Vlok </PERSON> will meet early this week with 40 mixed-race policemen, including Lt. <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON> <PERSON> Rockman </PERSON>. <PERSON> Rockman </PERSON> has become a folk hero among township youths since he began accusing police riot units of causing violence by beating protesters, bystanders and shoppers during anti-election demonstrations. `` -LRB- Police -RRB- are going to tag me as a terrorist and a Communist,'' <PERSON> Rockman </PERSON>, 30, said Friday at a memorial service for one of the victims of the election violence, 13-year-old <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> <PERSON> Ras </PERSON>. But, he added, other policemen `` have the same ideas and views as me and this is a sign of hope for us in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. I know I am not alone.''

<HEAD>Water Restrictions Are Sign of Times as Dry Season Nears</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> already is in its worst dry spell since the 1950s and its annual six-month dry spell is less than two weeks away, meaning little relief can be expected before spring. With most of the state already under voluntary or mandatory water-use restrictions, the outlook of water managers, farmers and environmentalists has turned from caution to concern. `` We may go into the dry season with one of the lowest reservoir storage levels in recent history,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Broward </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Water </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> Director <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON>. On Thursday, the <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Water </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> board declared a water emergency and urged voluntary water cutbacks by almost 4 million people in <LOCATION> Dade </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Broward </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Palm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> counties. <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Okeechobee </LOCATION>, a principal source of drinking water for residents of southern <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, is about 3 feet below its normal level for this time of year. To boost the lake's level, the water board decided to pump farm water runoff into it. That runoff normally would flow south through the <LOCATION> Everglades </LOCATION>. Environmentalists attacked the so-called `` back-pumping,'' saying the phosphorus-rich runoff promotes algae growth that robs marine life of oxygen. The restrictions, which may become mandatory next month, include limiting car washing and lawn watering to three times a week between 4 a.m. and 8 a.m., said <PERSON> Tilford </PERSON> <PERSON> Creel </PERSON>, the deputy director of the district, which covers 16 counties from south of <LOCATION> Orlando </LOCATION> to the Keys. During the 12-month-old drought, responsible for extensive brush fires in the <LOCATION> Everglades </LOCATION> last year that occasionally shrouded <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> in smoke, rainfall has been below normal in all sections of the state, except the <LOCATION> Panhandle </LOCATION>. `` This is the all-time low in what we have for total surface water storage,'' said <PERSON> Creel </PERSON>. In the 16-county <ORGANIZATION> Southwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Water </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION>, which includes <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Petersburg </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION>, mandatory water restrictions have been in effect since February. The tough measures have generated some spirited vigilantism. In <LOCATION> Bonita </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION>, for example, the local newspaper has printed the names and addresses of residents ticketed for water violations. Penalties for violating the mandatory restrictions in the Palatka-based <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Johns </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> district could go as high as $ 500 and 60 days in jail, although most people receive only a warning for a first violation, said spokesman <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Albanesi </PERSON>. `` People just assumed the water was going to be there. But attitude is slowly beginning to turn around,'' he said.

 Former President <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> said Saturday that <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s relations with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will improve if the Sandinistas hold free and fair elections next year. <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> came to this Central American country as head of a delegation that is to observe the electoral process here and the balloting on Feb. 25. The former president also observed <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s May 7 elections and called them fraudulent. Panamanian leader Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> had the elections canceled when, according to <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> and other international observers, the opposition candidate won by a landslide. <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s leftist Sandinista government, the 14-party opposition coalition and the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electoral </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> sent an invitation for observers to the <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Freely </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elected </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Heads </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Government </ORGANIZATION>, based at the <ORGANIZATION> Carter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> at <ORGANIZATION> Emory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ga </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electoral </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> is to organize and supervise the balloting. Former President <PERSON> Raul </PERSON> <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>, a member of the delegation, sat next to <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Rosalynn </PERSON>, at a news conference at <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION>'s international airport. `` If President <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON> and I and others can certify in February that the elections have been honest and fair and that the successful candidates are the legitimate leaders of <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, this would almost ensure, in my opinion, an immediate improvement in relations between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> said in answer to a question. He said he knew of existing `` differences'' between the opposition and President <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON>'s government. But he said it would be premature to address those issues until he had a chance to speak with all sides. Asked what lessons he had learned during the Panamanian elections that could be applied to his current task, <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> replied: `` From what I know to date, those means used to have a fraudulent election in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> have been carefully avoided for <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>.'' Referring to an aborted <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration plan to channel $ 3 million in aid to opposition presidential candidate <PERSON> Violeta </PERSON> <PERSON> Barrios </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Chamorro </PERSON>, <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> said any campaign contributions `` should be open and overt in nature and comply completely with the laws in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>.'' The project, which would have channeled the money through the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Endowment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democracy </ORGANIZATION>, was canceled because of opposition in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. Mrs. <PERSON> Chamorro </PERSON>, publisher of the opposition newspaper <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prensa </ORGANIZATION>, is being fielded by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Opposition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> coalition. <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> also denied speculation that he may be representing the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government, and said his delegation would remain impartial in its observations. Observers from the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> States </ORGANIZATION> also have been invited to monitor the process. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has not had an ambassador in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> since <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Melton </PERSON> was expelled in mid-1988 along with several other embassy officials, accused by the government of instigating unrest.

 An assailant opened fire Saturday on an Israeli army patrol from the Jordanian side of the border, slightly injuring two soldiers in the third such attack this month. In the occupied territories, clashes between <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> youths and <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers reportedly injured four Arabs, and a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> man shot in a clash with troops last week died of his injuries. Leaders of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s two main parties met Saturday to discuss a <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> peace plan offered by <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>. Two meetings last week failed to bridge differences over the plan, which calls for Israeli-Palestinian peace talks. The border incident occurred in pre-dawn darkness near the communal settlement of <LOCATION> Ashdot </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Yakov </LOCATION>, three miles south of the Sea of <LOCATION> Galilee </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio said the assailant apparently was a <LOCATION> Jordanian </LOCATION> army soldier who ran to the border and ambushed the Israeli patrol, firing about 30 rounds while hiding behind a bush. The Israelis returned fire. A Jordanian army spokesman told <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON>'s official news agency, <PERSON> Petra </PERSON>, that a <LOCATION> Jordanian </LOCATION> soldier fired at an `` unusual movement'' along the <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> and that `` Israeli patrol cars ... fired in the same direction and that resulted in a slight injury to one of our people.'' Another Jordanian official told The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> the firefight appeared to be `` an accident.'' `` It was night, and when you are on the cease-fire line, -LRB- you know -RRB- how alert you are to any unusual movement,'' he said. The Israeli soldiers suffered slight shrapnel wounds. It was the sixth attack this year on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> from along the <LOCATION> Jordan-Israel </LOCATION> border and the third this month. The most recent attack occurred Sept. 7, when several Soviet-designed Katyusha rockets were fired from <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> into <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. There were no injuries. In the occupied territories, Palestinians paralyzed the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> city of <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION> with a general strike to protest the deaths Friday of two <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> youths shot by <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> troops. Another Palestinian, 45-year-old <PERSON> Samir </PERSON> <PERSON> al </PERSON> <PERSON> Akhbar </PERSON>, died Saturday of wounds suffered in a clash with troops last week, officials at <LOCATION> Anglican </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION> said. <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> reports said <PERSON> Akhbar </PERSON> was shot in the back while trying to keep soldiers from beating his son. Israeli officials said he was shot when he tried to grab a soldier's gun. His death raised to 571 the number of Palestinians killed in clashes with Israelis in the 21-month-old uprising against Israeli rule of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. Forty Israelis have died, and 114 Arabs accused of collaborating with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> have been killed by other Arabs. Arab reporters said four Palestinians were wounded in clashes Saturday. The army said it was checking the reports. Egyptian President <PERSON> Hosni </PERSON> <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> proposed a 10-point peace plan that includes Palestinian elections in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> and Israeli-Palestinian peace talks in <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION> that would include two Arabs deported from the occupied lands. That aspect of the plan is designed to satisfy <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s demand to talk only to Palestinians from the territories and the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>'s insistence that Palestinians living abroad be included in talks Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s right-wing <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> bloc and the left-leaning <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> led by Finance Minister <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON> <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> are deeply divided over the plan. Labor leaders have indicated their willingness to talk to a delegation including deported Arabs, but <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> officials view it as an attempt to bring in the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> through the back door.

 Senior leader <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaoping </PERSON> appeared in public Saturday for the first time in more than three months, looking tan and healthy despite recent reports he was seriously ill or even near death. National television news showed the 85-year-old leader laughing, gesturing animatedly and walking steadily at the start of a 70-minute meeting at the Great Hall of the People with T.D. <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>, a Nobel Prize-winning physicist from <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. He displayed his bronzed hand to <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>, and said he had been swimming for up to an hour a day in the sea. `` I do n't like indoor swimming pools,'' he was heard to say, `` but enjoy swimming in nature.'' <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> reportedly spent part of the past three months, among the most traumatic in Communist <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s history, at <LOCATION> Beidaihe </LOCATION>, a favorite resort for top officials along the northeast coast. <PERSON> Deng </PERSON>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s most powerful leader, has cut down on his public duties in recent years and has often disappeared for long periods, each time sparking rumors he is seriously ill. But this time both Chinese and foreign sources consistently reported that he was being treated for prostate cancer and may not have long to live. The lively <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> press in recent weeks reported <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> to be in a coma or already dead. <PERSON> Deng </PERSON>'s last public appearance was on June 9, when he congratulated martial law officers for their leadership in quelling what he called a `` counter-revolutionary rebellion'' intent on overthrowing the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and the government. Troops stormed <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> June 3 and June 4, killing hundreds and perhaps thousands of people as they shot their way to student-occupied Tiananmen Square. <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> also is believed to have had the ultimate say in the decision, announced June 24, to purge <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> General Secretary <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> <PERSON> Ziyang </PERSON> and accuse him of splitting the party by supporting the pro-democracy goals of the student protesters. <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON>, the top advocate of economic reforms initiated by <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> 10 years ago, has not been seen in public since May 19. He is believed to be under house arrest while the party decides whether to press criminal charges against him. <PERSON> Deng </PERSON>, in an apparent reference to <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON>, said Saturday that `` some of our comrades just immersed themselves in their specific work, did not pay enough attention to ideological and political developments, were not vigilant enough against the serious corruption.'' `` The recent turmoil has taught us a major lesson,'' <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> said. `` After the turmoil, all of us have become sober-minded.'' <PERSON> Deng </PERSON>, whose support of economic reforms has generally been tempered by a hard line against political dissent, said <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> will not change its policies of reform. But he added that <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> must stick to socialism. `` There would be no new <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> today without the leadership of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>,'' he said. <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> also echoed the conservative line on reform by saying production must develop at `` an appropriate pace,'' rather than the rapid pace preferred by <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> that is now being blamed for inflation and corruption. <PERSON> Deng </PERSON>'s comments, as carried by television news and the official <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, did not specifically mention <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON>. In 1987, <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> retired from all his official posts except the powerful chairmanship of the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Military </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. However, he is still regarded as the only man powerful enough to maintain a truce among the party's different factions, and rumors of his death invariably raise fears of a destabilizing power struggle. In recent days, Chinese officials have suggested <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> was about to emerge in public, possibly to reassure the <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> people before Oct. 1 _ the 40th anniversary of the <LOCATION> People </LOCATION><LOCATION> 's </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> _ that the government leadership is intact. <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>, a Chinese-American who won the Nobel Prize for physics in 1957 and is a frequent visitor to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, was not available for comment on his meeting with <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> or a luncheon afterwards. <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> also met later with <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON>'s successor as party chief, <PERSON> Jiang </PERSON> <PERSON> Zemin </PERSON>, who spoke of current efforts to help students `` enhance their political awareness and make a clear distinction between right and wrong.'' Those efforts include heavy doses of political education. <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Jiang </PERSON> also told <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> that Chinese leaders have shown `` much concern'' for civilians injured or killed during the military takeover of the city. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> says about 300 people were killed during the clashes, but Chinese leaders have made no public statements of remorse for the bloodshed and the official media have not reported on civilians who lost their lives.

<HEAD>Company Plans Reopening of Railway to Grand Canyon</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WILLIAMS, Ariz. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A railroad track abandoned 21 years ago will carry paying passengers again beginning Monday with restoration of service to Grand Canyon National Park. The 64-mile Grand Canyon Railway, originally a spur serving people crossing the high country of northern <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> on the <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fe </LOCATION> railroad, will carry tourists arriving in this town of 2,500 on Interstate 40, which largely replaced old <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> 66. The developers hope the romance of their steam locomotives and the scenery along the tracks will persuade tourists to park their cars and pay the fare rather than drive to the canyon. Fars for the round trip will be $ 37 for adults and $ 21 for children under 12. A ceremonial trip for public officials and other railroad guests was scheduled Sunday, the 88th anniversary of the first passenger service on the original line. The rail line passes through dramatic scenery, including ponderosa pine forests near <LOCATION> Williams </LOCATION>, the sparse plains of the high plateau and steep canyons near the northern terminus, in Grand Canyon Village only 200 yards from the Grand Canyon's <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rim </LOCATION>. Grand Canyon National Park spokesman <PERSON> Chuck </PERSON> <PERSON> Lundy </PERSON> said train travel could help the environment of the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rim </LOCATION>, visited by 810,000 private vehicles and 3 -LCB- million people last year. A <ORGANIZATION> Northern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arizona </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> study found that enough people would opt for a train ride to the canyon to reduce road traffic by 41 percent, <PERSON> Lundy </PERSON> said. `` We do n't see the train as being our solution, but we do see it as one ingredient, one element of that solution. We're very supportive and pleased that the railroad is returning,'' he said. Part of the $ 85 million project cost has gone to collect and restore enough locomotives and passenger cars to accommodate a projected 135,000 passengers next year. Some has been spent to replace rails and 30,000 weather-worn ties. The railroad is the brainchild of <PERSON> Max </PERSON> <PERSON> Biegert </PERSON>, an engineer who owns a commercial aviation company in <LOCATION> Chandler </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Biegert </PERSON> wound up holding title to 22 miles of track along the line after a developer defaulted on a loan. He hired <PERSON> Roth </PERSON> as a consultant, and they put together an investment package which raised $ 15 million to organize the company and buy land. The company has purchased four locomotives and 29 coach cars built by the <ORGANIZATION> Pullman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, which have been repainted original <PERSON> Pullman </PERSON> green, said spokeswoman <PERSON> Kathleen </PERSON> <PERSON> Boyd </PERSON>.

 Fugitive Chinese student leaders and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> scholars gathered Saturday to assess the impact of the bloody crackdown on student demonstrators in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> and prospects for democracy in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> _ and to remember. The conference at <ORGANIZATION> Brandeis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> on the June massacre in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> began with a moment of silence led by <PERSON> Shen </PERSON> <PERSON> Tong </PERSON>, who was on the <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> authorities' most-wanted list when he escaped from <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. He is attending <ORGANIZATION> Brandeis </ORGANIZATION> on a scholarship. `` My feelings were almost frozen,'' <PERSON> Shen </PERSON> said, recalling the night of June 3 when government troops came to clear out student protesters who had taken over <LOCATION> Tiananmen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION> in the Chinese capital. He said he was trying to negotiate with the soldiers when they opened fire. `` When I was speaking to one of the soldiers on a truck that had stopped, the officer of the truck shot a girl standing next to me. She was shot in the face,'' he said. Hundreds, perhaps thousands, of people are believed to have been killed. How the massacre happened and what can be done to keep the democracy movement in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> going were the focus of the two-day conference titled `` Perspectives on Tiananmen.'' Participants included Rep. <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Solarz </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, who warned of stiffened <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> sanctions against <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> if the repression there continues; <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Lu </PERSON>, second in command among the student demonstrators in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>; and <PERSON> Wu'er </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaixi </PERSON>, who made a dangerous 10-day journey to escape his country. Saturday's conference opening had the feel of a reunion as many Chinese students who had not seen one another since the demonstration embraced and exchanged news. <PERSON> Yuan </PERSON> <PERSON> Liu </PERSON>, president of the Newton-based <ORGANIZATION> China </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, which has dispensed news to and from <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> all summer, was busy passing on the latest information from his contacts in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. Among other things, he said the number of students at <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>'s major universities allowed to take courses in humanities has been halved and that many students will be required to spend a year in the army for what he called `` brainwashing.'' <PERSON> Shen </PERSON>, 21, told of his escape, saying that after being hidden for days by friends, he went to the <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> airport and presented his passport, which had been issued earlier because he was already planning to study at <LOCATION> Brandeis </LOCATION>. In an apparent mistake by authorities, he was ushered on board his flight. `` I think that change in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> is inexorable,'' <PERSON> Shen </PERSON> said. `` But what I really care about is, after there is a leadership change, what can we do?'' He said students in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and out must continue to work toward gradual change. <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Lu </PERSON>, who marshaled demonstrators as the deputy student leader at the <LOCATION> Tiananmen </LOCATION> rally, said the future of the pro-democracy movement depends on breaking through the propaganda the <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> government disseminated after the massacre. `` Information is power,'' said <PERSON> Li </PERSON>. `` In the future, the democracy movement in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> must be a cooperative effort between students inside and outside of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Solarz </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Subcommittee on East Asian and <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> Affairs, said the pro-democracy movement must continue to emphasize non-violence. `` I do not think that armed violence is a solution to the problems of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>,'' he said. But he did say the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would be willing to impose tougher sanctions on the <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> government if repression deepened. <PERSON> Solarz </PERSON> criticized President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s reaction to events in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> as a `` tepid response.'' `` The president seemed to have trouble finding his own voice,'' <PERSON> Solarz </PERSON> said. `` There were times, indeed, when he seemed more in sympathy with the difficulties of the party leaders than he was with the aspirations of the people.''

 Calm has returned to the dusty streets of this port for the first time since the wreck of the Exxon Valdez, but the tranquility belies the social friction caused by the big spill, <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> and big bucks. <PERSON> Valdez </PERSON> was flush this summer with millions of dollars spent in cleaning up the nation's largest oil spill. Thousands of job-seekers came here for a chance to earn more than $ 16 an hour sopping up oil. The motels were full. Business was good. Last week, <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> halted its summer cleanup, pulling its laborers off the shores of Prince <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sound </PERSON> and sending them home, saying the shortening daylight hours and worsening weather made further work ill-advised this time of year. Now <PERSON> Valdez </PERSON> faces a long winter of problems they left behind. The 16-bed jail is full and the court docket is backed up because of a record number of summer arrests. There's a housing shortage. A cleanup-caused labor shortage persists, but some employers are reluctant to rehire workers who abandoned their jobs last spring for <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION>'s high wages. `` It was short-term bucks, and in the end it's going to do a lot of damage to this town,'' said <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, manager of a local hardware store. The small town at the foot of the <LOCATION> Chugach </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountains </LOCATION> was the end of the rainbow for the laborers who came in the spring. But most will spend their pot of gold elsewhere. Even many of the cleanup workers who were Valdez residents are returning only briefly before taking off on extended vacations to warmer locales. That has sparked tensions among the town's 3,700 residents. `` They're not sticking around,'' <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said. `` We'd like to expand, but we ca n't seem to get anyone to work. Most of these guys made so much money they're leaving town.'' Still, <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> and other merchants said they profited from the boom that came from the effort to clean up 11 million gallons of North Slope crude oil that spilled when the tanker <PERSON> Exxon </PERSON> <PERSON> Valdez </PERSON> hit a reef in <LOCATION> Prince </LOCATION> <LOCATION> William </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sound </LOCATION> on March 24. `` Business has been real good,'' <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said. `` It was crazy. We normally would deal with 200 to 300 people a day. We were dealing with over a thousand. We sold stuff we never dreamed of selling.'' Business remains brisk at the <ORGANIZATION> Pipeline </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>, a popular watering hole since the days of the construction boom for the trans-Alaska oil pipeline, which terminates at <LOCATION> Port </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valdez </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>, manager and co-owner, said he extended the bar's hours because of the demand. It opens at 8 a.m. and closes at 5 a.m. `` It's even better than the pipeline days,'' <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> said. `` As long as the spill had to happen, it certainly helped the economic picture of this town.'' The town's economy is expected to remain strong with more than 200 new long-term jobs created by the cleanup. City officials are most concerned about the prospect of a winter of social problems generated by so many people with bulging wallets and time on their hands. `` We're going to have a fair amount of our residents who are going to have a lot of money in their pockets to spend,'' city planner <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Hennigh </PERSON> said. `` In the middle of winter boredom sets in, cabin fever, and that's the time when tempers get shorter. There probably has to be some sociological downside to this.'' Police Chief <PERSON> Bert </PERSON> <PERSON> Cottle </PERSON> already has seen the downside. `` The calls that we're getting now are of a more serious nature as far as violence is concerned,'' he said. `` It's been a long summer. More people are stressed out.'' Alcohol figures in more than 70 percent of the complaints <LOCATION> Valdez </LOCATION> police are responding to, <PERSON> Cottle </PERSON> said. Some cleanup workers are drowning their sorrows after spending, gambling or otherwise losing their summer riches. `` We're seeing people who have been sending their paychecks home all summer, expecting to come back to $ 20,000 in the bank. Instead they've got a ` Dear <PERSON> John </PERSON>' letter waiting,'' <PERSON> Cottle </PERSON> said. The demand for housing caused by the influx of new residents shows no sign of letting up. <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON>, publisher of the <ORGANIZATION> Valdez </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Vanguard </ORGANIZATION>, said people still line up at the front desk on Tuesdays for an advance peek at the few housing ads that will appear when the weekly newspaper is published on Wednesdays.

 Hundreds of people packed a church in a black suburb Saturday to pay tribute to <PERSON> Anton </PERSON> <PERSON> Lubowski </PERSON>, a leader in the Namibian nationalist movement who was assassinated outside his home. `` In a racially divided country such as ours, <PERSON> Comrade </PERSON> <PERSON> Anton </PERSON>'s role as a bridge builder will be sorely missed,'' said <PERSON> Theo-Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Gurirab </PERSON>, foreign affairs chief of the <ORGANIZATION> South-West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Africa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <PERSON> Lubowski </PERSON>, 37, was shot in the head with an AK-47 assault rifle outside his <LOCATION> Windhoek </LOCATION> home Tuesday night. Police are holding 50-year-old Irishman <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Acheson </PERSON> in connection with the killing, but no one has been charged. <PERSON> Lubowski </PERSON> was the only ranking white member of the Namibian nationalist guerrilla movement against South African rule. The Lutheran Church in the <LOCATION> Katutura </LOCATION> neighborhood was overflowing, and about 200 people listened from outside the church doors to the service for the man to be buried this week. <PERSON> Lubowski </PERSON>'s parents, his ex-wife and two children were there, along with several diplomats such as <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> Renwick </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s ambassador to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> `` Nothing can justify so callous a murder of a man ... who devoted the best part of his time to fighting for a truly non-racial <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Gurirab </PERSON> said. `` Did it really have to happen now, at a time when his country and people needed him most?'' <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>, which has been ruled by <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> since 1915, is having elections in November expected to lead to independence early next year. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> agreed to implement independence under <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> supervision after signing a regional peace treaty last year that also calls for the withdrawal of <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>'s 50,000 soldiers from <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>.

He joined its legal political wing and served as the group's unofficial spokesman in <LOCATION> Windhoek </LOCATION> while most of the leadership was in exile. Right-wing newspapers often ridiculed <PERSON> Lubowski </PERSON> for belonging to the leftist-oriented organization. <PERSON> Lubowski </PERSON> studied at two of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s best universities, <LOCATION> Stellenbosch </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION>, and at one point was an officer in the South African army. His law practice was based in <LOCATION> Windhoek </LOCATION>, but he represented many anti-apartheid activists on trial in neighboring <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Lubowski </PERSON> helped represent 14 blacks sentenced to death for the mob killing of a black policeman in 1985. Four days before <PERSON> Lubowski </PERSON>'s death, the 14 won an appeal to have their case retried.

<HEAD>Scientist Issues Climate Warning, Seeks Fossil Fuel Cut</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Sharp cuts in the use of fossil fuels like oil, gas and coal are necessary to help prevent climate change that could cause dangerous overheating of the earth, a leading scientist warned Saturday. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Woodwell </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Woods </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hole </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, told a conference at the <ORGANIZATION> Smithsonian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institution </ORGANIZATION> that restrictions on the use of fossil fuels, an end to deforestation and a start on reforestation `` are essential.'' `` We are failing foolishly and dangerously'' to deal with environmental threats, <PERSON> Woodwell </PERSON> said at the conference on `` The Global Environment, Are We Overreacting.'' Woodwell focused largely on the so-called Greenhouse effect, the threat of global warming which many scientists fear will result from the continued introduction of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. A colorless, odorless gas, carbon dioxide allows warmth from the sun to continue heating the Earth, but keeps portions of the Earth's warmth from radiating out into space The result, many researchers fear, will be an overheating of the planet, changing climate and possibly seriously damaging crops and other forms of life. Asked for a solution, <PERSON> Woodwell </PERSON> said: `` Well, you do some pretty straightforward things. You reduce the release of fossil fuel carbon into the atmosphere by restricting the use of fossil fuel. How much? Maybe all of it. ... You stop deforestation and you start reforestation.'' <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ehrlich </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Stanford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> suggested that Americans should be paying at least $ 2.30-a-gallon for gasoline, since automobiles and trucks are a major carbon dioxide source. `` If it did n't cut consumption, it would at least reduce the deficit,'' said <PERSON> Ehrlich </PERSON>, referring to the additional money that would be raised by taxing gasoline to raise the price to that level. While scientists have measured a 25 percent increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide over the last century, debate continues about the Greenhouse warming and whether it can yet be measured. Several scientists have urged a wait-and-see attitude, contending that natural fources such as increased cloudiness could restore balance to the planet. `` Most of the projections about the future are not verifiable without performing an experiment, and it gets performed on guess what laboratory?'' said <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Schneider </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atmospheric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Boulder </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colo. </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Likens </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Botanical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gardens </ORGANIZATION> pointed out that dangerous air pollution has become so common that scientists have begun speaking of `` pollution climates'' in some areas, particularly parts of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> `` Chemicals released into the air come back to us in the form of rainout or fallout. The point is, what goes up does come down, and sometimes it travels great distances before it does so,'' added <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Fowler </PERSON> of the University of <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>.

 An explosion Saturday aboard a bus in the ethnically troubled republic of <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION> killed three people and injured other passengers, the official <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> news agency said. In the republic's capital, <LOCATION> Baku </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Azerbaijani </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> ended an emergency session with a call for direct control of an enclave disputed with neighboring <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> news agency said. In its report on the explosion, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said the bus was traveling from the Georgian capital of <LOCATION> Tbilisi </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Baku </LOCATION>, on the <LOCATION> Caspian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> 300 miles to the southeast. The news agency did not link the explosion to the ethnic strife between Armenians and Azerbaijanis. It said the <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION> secret police were investigating. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> did not say how many people were injured, nor did it say how many passengers were aboard the bus or give other details. About 100 people have been killed in ethnic violence during the past 18 months in the conflict over control of the enclave of <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION>, which is predominantly Christian Armenian. The Armenians want the mountainous area, which is within <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION>'s borders, to be transferred to their control. <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION> was in mainly Moslem <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION>'s jurisdiction until February, when <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> moved in to rule the enclave directly in an effort to stem the violence. The conflict has forced hundreds of thousands of Armenians and Azerbaijanis in the region to flee their homes. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> reported the <ORGANIZATION> Azerbaijani </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>'s resolution on Saturday claimed that <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION> is legally part of <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION> and asked <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> to reconsider its central rule over the area. In the Armenian capital of <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION> a special session of the republic's legislature was convened to discuss the Azerbaijani resolution, the news agency also said. Communist Party officials are scheduled to meet Tuesday in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> to consider changes in the country's nationalities policy and seek ways to calm ethnic quarrels like the one between <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>. The Azerbaijani lawmakers will soon submit for public discussion a proposed law `` to provide sovereignty of the republic, or independent exercise of legislative, executive and judicial power over the whole of the territory of the republic in the interests of its multi-national population,'' <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said.

 Pizza Hut is jumping into the fray in the pizzas wars, urging diners not to make a `` Mcstake'' and try the pizza McDonald's is offering at a few outlets. The upshot? An outwardly mild-mannered war of words, half of them prefaced by `` mc.'' The burger giant professes itself pleased with the Pizza Hut's advertising counter-campaign, even though it goes so far as to compare McDonald's pizza to a hockey puck `` We want to thank them for giving our own ad campaign some extra topping,'' said <ORGANIZATION> McDonald </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Chuck </PERSON> <PERSON> Rubner </PERSON>, who said he was `` Mcdelighted'' with the attention. Pizza Hut launched the campaign in newspapers and on television after McDonald's added pizza to the menu at 24 outlets in southern <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> and western <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> this summer. The burger colossus hopes to lure families and couples during the dinner hour, a slack time for much of the fast-food business. `` If you're looking for great pizza, make no Mcstake,'' Pizza Hut fires back in some of its ads. `` We always use dough that's made fresh daily. Not McFrozen.'' A television ad shows hockey players taking slap shots at a puck-shaped blob of frozen dough. Although Pizza Hut has about 22 percent of the $ 314 billion-a-year pizza market, it's not taking the McDonald's test lightly. `` The television commercial is very humorous,'' said <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Rydell </PERSON>, a spokesman for Pizza Hut in <LOCATION> Wichita </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kan. </LOCATION> `` We're being, however, very serious to our approach to the McDonald's threat.''

 The Rev. <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said Saturday that his <ORGANIZATION> Rainbow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION> will go the districts of six Democratic congressmen who voted to cut the capital gains tax, to alert their constituents to the benefits the rich will gain. `` There is no justification for further subsidizing the rich through the capital gains tax by abandoning the poor,'' said <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. `` The capital gains tax is unfair. It is immoral. It must be challenged.'' On Thursday, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Means </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> approved the tax cut in an amendment to a larger tax bill. The reduction, sought by President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, would lower the maximum tax rate on profits from sales of assets from the current 33 percent to 19.6 percent for 2 -LCB- years. The rate then would be raised to 28 percent but assets would be indexed to eliminate taxes based on increased value created by inflation. The six, including Rep. <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Jenkins </PERSON>, D-Ga., who co-sponsored the amendment, joined with 13 Republicans to pass the proposal But in so doing, the six Democrats incurred the wrath of Democratic leadership. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s action was supported at a news conference which was attended by <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> and Rep. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Rangel </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, a Ways and Means member. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> called the tax `` unethical, immoral and it does n't make political sense'' for the Democratic party to `` give a tax break to the wealthiest in our country'' at a time when the poor continue to suffer. `` I think this is clear this is the worst example of <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hood </PERSON> in reverse,'' <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said. Former President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> attempted his version of trickle down economics, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said, in the belief the rich would help <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> by reinvesting tax savings. `` They did not do that'' and the rich today probably wo n't either, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said `` This is a payoff for the very elite of the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign. It's not good for <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>.'' Thus, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said, the campaign was targeted at the `` six Democrats who jumped ship and abandoned the party.'' `` I'm concerned that these congressmen who broke rank'' have not informed their constituents of their actions, and the poor and `` the farmers are not aware of this,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said. Besides <PERSON> Jenkins </PERSON>, the Democrats include Reps. <PERSON> J.J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pickle </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Andrews </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Beryl </PERSON> <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Andy </PERSON> <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Ronnie </PERSON> <PERSON> Flippo </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Rangel </PERSON> said his party was in a fight for its principles and that the Democratic-controlled <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> had helped pass Republican legislation the congressman said was bad for Americans and bad for the party's principles. `` Certainly no six monkeys on the Ways and Means committee are going to direct where my party is going,'' <PERSON> Rangel </PERSON> said.

 The <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> opens its 44th session Tuesday in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> still uncertain if <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> will again seek to address the delegates. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials said the leader of the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> has not made a request for a visa.

Instead, the international body convened a meeting in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> where <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> outlined his ideas about the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>'s mission and its attitude toward <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> At this year's <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> session the delegations of 159 nations will review such issues as the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, the environment, international debt, the war on drugs, and <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>'s transition to independence.

The Palestinian conflict is scheduled to be discussed in November, but <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> could address the assembly during the general debate. Last year then-Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> denied <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> a visa, but since then the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has opened direct talks with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Tunisia </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials said last week the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> wo n't announce whether it will grant a visa to <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> until a new request is received. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> sources said privately that the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> is divided over whether to grant such a request and Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> has not yet ruled on the issue. The Assembly is expected to choose a new president Tuesday, replacing <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Dante </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Caputo </PERSON>.

 Nearly 4,000 Hispanics were sworn in as <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizens Saturday in an emotional ceremony timed to coincide with local celebrations of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s Independence Day. `` It was very emotional. It just gets you back in touch with our liberties and what it means to be a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizen,'' said <PERSON> Lupe </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramos </PERSON>, an organizer of the citizenship ceremony. Organizers billed the Weingart Stadium event as one of the largest of its kind for a particular ethnic group. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Real </PERSON> administered the oath of citizenship and tiny flags were distributed to each of the 3,950 new citizens, representing 19 Latin American nations. Mexican nationals, at 2,546, accounted for the majority of those sworn in Saturday. Others included 333 Salvadorans, 229 Cubans and 182 Guatemalans, Ms. <PERSON> Ramos </PERSON> said. `` You can imagine how beautiful it is when you have 4,000 people waving the flag and screaming because this is what they've been waiting for,'' she said.

 A former <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Roebuck </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> store clerk has settled his dispute with the retail giant over profits from a popular socket wrench he invented more than 25 years ago. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> was 18 years old in 1964 when he invented a `` quick release'' wrench that eventually sold by the millions. On Friday, the 44-year-old <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> settled an $ 8.2 million patent infringement case that alleged <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> had cheated him out of his rightful royalties from the device. <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Kathy </PERSON> <PERSON> Gucfa </PERSON> declined to give any details of the agreement, saying part of the settlement is that neither side will comment on it. <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> was believed on his way home to the <LOCATION> Chattanooga </LOCATION> suburb of <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> and could n't be reached for comment. His attorney <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Davidson </PERSON> declined to comment. <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> was a clerk at a <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> store in <LOCATION> Gardner </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, when he invented the wrench in his spare time. The wrench has a push button that permits removal of sockets from the tool with one hand. <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> obtained a patent for the wrench design in 1965, and <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> paid him $ 10,000 for rights to the patent. He then joined the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>. While stationed in <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, he saw a <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> catalog and was astounded at the display the wrench got because, he said, the company had led him to believe the tool had only minor sales potential. But from 1965 to 1975, <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> sold more than 19 million of the wrenches for a net profit of more than $ 44 million, according to documents in the case. `` I was real young, and when you're young, you may tend to trust people too much,'' <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> once said of his decision to take <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION>' offer <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> sued in 1969 seeking to rescind the agreement under which he assigned the patent to the company. A federal jury in 1978 awarded him $ 1 million after finding that <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> fraudulently obtained the patent. <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> also asked for damages for the estimated 14 million socket wrenches sold after 1977. He had estimated <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> earned $ 172 million from sales of the wrench between 1977 and 1982, but attorneys for the retailer said the profit was closer to $ 5 million. In April 1982, a federal jury found that <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> violated the patent and awarded <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> $ 5 million, an award later increased to $ 8.2 million by the judge on the grounds the infringement was willful. That decision was overturned in 1983 by an appeals court, which ordered a new trial. <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> said after the appellate court decision that he kept pursuing the case more for the principle than the money. `` I'm right, they're wrong,'' he said. `` I've wrapped up a majority of my life around the thing. I'm just trying to get what is justly and rightly mine.'' The new trial was in its fifth day Friday when the settlement was reached.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Utah </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pardons </ORGANIZATION> relied on statements made out of context, false information and `` jailhouse gossip'' in denying clemency to death row inmate <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Andrews </PERSON>, his attorneys contend. <PERSON> Andrews </PERSON>, who at nearly 15 years has been on death row longer than anyone in the nation, has asked the board to vacate its decision and grant him an unprecedent second commutation hearing. <PERSON> Andrews </PERSON>, 35, of <LOCATION> Jonesboro </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> La. </LOCATION>, was convicted for his part in the torture-killings of three people during a 1974 robbery. Five people were forced to drink a caustic liquid drain cleaner and all were shot, but two men survived. <PERSON> Pierre </PERSON> <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> Selby </PERSON>, who admitted firing the shots, was executed in 1987. The defense petition filed Friday claims the board did n't divulge some information it used in making its decision, including a prison psychological report that `` apparently branded <PERSON> Andrews </PERSON> as a sociopath.'' The petition also contends that in testimony during <PERSON> Andrews </PERSON>' commutation hearing, a prison official alluded to information obtained from prison informants tying <PERSON> Andrews </PERSON> to an escape plot _ information the prison branded `` jailhouse gossip. The board's decision was also influenced by statements <PERSON> Andrews </PERSON> made in a taped interview with a prison social worker without a lawyer present, in violation of Andrews' constitutional rights, the attorneys said.

<TEXT>
 Five animal rights activists were arrested Saturday after as many as 60 protesters chased bow hunters through the woods of a state park at the beginning of deer-hunting season. A sixth activist also was cited for violating <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>'s hunter harassment law but was not taken into custody, <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> Natural Resources police said. The activists gathered before dawn near the <ORGANIZATION> McKee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Veshers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Area </ORGANIZATION> about 50 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION> and traveled to the state-owned land when hunters began arriving about 5 a.m., said organizer <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Pacelle </PERSON> of The Fund for Animals. The demonstrators then broke into groups of five, and each group followed a hunter from the time he stepped from his vehicle, <PERSON> Pacelle </PERSON> said. `` We did n't raise our voices but we did let them know in measured tones we were there to protect the deer and to prevent them from cruelly killing these animals,'' said <PERSON> Pacelle </PERSON>. `` The hunters dashed through the cornfields to escape but generally we stayed with them.'' The activists originally had planned to spread human hair around the tree stands used by bow hunters when they lie in wait for their prey, but the rainy weather prompted them instead to `` focus on establishing a presence around the hunter that would deter the deer from approaching,'' <PERSON> Pacelle </PERSON> said. Natural Resources Police Sgt. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Schuller </PERSON> said police and other officials were prepared for the protesters, estimated by <PERSON> Pacelle </PERSON> at 60 and police at 40. No violence was reported. `` One hunter was pointing an arrow at a group of activists repeatedly ... and there were lots of threats of violence but nothing seems to have been done,'' <PERSON> Pacelle </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Pacelle </PERSON> said the group plans to challenge the state's hunter harassment law on the grounds that it violates the First Amendment right to freedom of expression. A similiar <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> law was declared unconstitutional in a federal court in February 1988, and that ruling was upheld by a federal appeals court in December 1988, <PERSON> Pacelle </PERSON> said. First offenders of <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>'s hunter harassment law face fines up to $ 500.

 Voters in a southeastern district elected an opposition legislator to <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> Saturday, handing the Communists their fourth straight defeat in special elections, according to preliminary results. The by-elections have demonstrated strong anti-Communist sentiment ahead of general elections scheduled to be held by June. Also Saturday, reform Communists preparing for a showdown with hard-line party members established an organization calling for peaceful change. They elected the most liberal member of the country's four-man leadership, <PERSON> Imre </PERSON> <PERSON> Pozsgay </PERSON>, to head the Movement for a <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hungary </ORGANIZATION>. Citing preliminary results from Saturday's polling, state television reported that 59 percent of the voters chose opposition candidate <PERSON> Gyula </PERSON> <PERSON> Marx </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Zala </LOCATION> <LOCATION> county </LOCATION> on the Yugoslav border. <PERSON> Marx </PERSON> was supported by the Hungarian Democratic Forum, the <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Young </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> and the League of Free Democrats. He defeated <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> candidate <PERSON> Istvan </PERSON> <PERSON> Gyoerffy </PERSON> and <PERSON> Istvan </PERSON> <PERSON> Schein </PERSON>, an opposition Social Democrat. The newscast reported a turnout of 61 percent of eligible voters, but it gave no other details. Three other opposition legislators won by-elections in July and August, shutting out Communist candidates in the first multi-party voting since the Communists consolidated power in <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> in 1947. The Communist leadership decided in February to endorse multi-party elections, arousing suspicions among some of its East bloc allies. The general elections to fill more than 300 Parliament seats are to be held by June. <PERSON> Pozsgay </PERSON>, speaking after he was elected to head the Movement for a <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hungary </ORGANIZATION>, said the organization was open to people of most political persuasions, but not Marxists resisting the change to a multi-party democracy.

 Premier <PERSON> Mouloud </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamrouche </PERSON> on Saturday appointed mainly Western-oriented technocrats and people viewed as reformers to a new Cabinet. <PERSON> Hamrouche </PERSON>, named to the job a week ago by President <PERSON> Chadli </PERSON> <PERSON> Bendjedid </PERSON>, picked <PERSON> Sid </PERSON> <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON> <PERSON> Ghozali </PERSON>, former head of the state oil and gas monopoly <ORGANIZATION> Sonatrach </ORGANIZATION>, as foreign minister. Bendjedid's announcement on Sept. 9 that Premier <PERSON> Kasdi </PERSON> <PERSON> Merbah </PERSON> had been fired for opposing a reform program briefly led to a constitutional crisis, as <PERSON> Merbah </PERSON> tried to retain his post. But he gave way later the same day. The nomination of <PERSON> Ghozali </PERSON> as foreign minister was the most significant of <PERSON> Hamrouche </PERSON>'s new appontments. <PERSON> Ghozali </PERSON>, 52, is a main partisan of Bendjedid's reform program, which includes introducing a multiparty political system and increasing the role of private enterprise in the state-directed economy. He headed <ORGANIZATION> Sonatrach </ORGANIZATION> for 12 years, building it into a massive state enterprise. Later, <PERSON> Ghozali </PERSON> became minister of hydraulics in what was widely regarded as a demotion. He then was named Algerian ambassador to <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION>. He returned to the government as finance minister in 1988. <PERSON> Ghozali </PERSON> is considered a Western-oriented technocrat advocating economic and financial reform. His appointment was a signal that <PERSON> Bendjedid </PERSON> is determined to push ahead despite obstacles from the Old Guard of the ruling party. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> has held power since <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION> won independence from <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> in 1962. Other ministers considered enlightened technocrats were <PERSON> Ghazi </PERSON> <PERSON> Hidouchi </PERSON>, economics minister; <PERSON> Hacene </PERSON> <PERSON> Kahlouche </PERSON>, minister of heavy industry; <PERSON> Smail </PERSON> <PERSON> Goumeziane </PERSON>, minister of commerce; <PERSON> Hamid </PERSON> <PERSON> Sidi </PERSON> <PERSON> Said </PERSON>, minister of posts and telecommunications. They have long worked closely with <PERSON> Hamrouche </PERSON>, formerly the government's secretary-general. In the new Cabinet, the Ministries of Information, Culture, Tourism and Veterans Affairs were abolished, in another move seen as signaling transformation of an autocratically ruled state into something closer to a Western-style democracy. The <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION>, headed by a succession of party stalwarts, was widely criticized for maintaining rigid controls over the Algerian press and radio introduced by the late president <PERSON> Houari </PERSON> <PERSON> Boumedienne </PERSON>. After October's riots in <LOCATION> Algiers </LOCATION> and other cities, <PERSON> Bendjedid </PERSON> promised to free the press, radio and television from state control. He also announced his program of political pluralism. <PERSON> Hamrouche </PERSON>'s Cabinet keeps just three ministers from the previous government in their same jobs.

 A crowded second-floor balcony of an old house collapsed on to a street wedding procession, killing 10 people and injuring 17, a police official said Saturday. He said three children, six women and a man were killed but he did not know how many of the victims were on the balcony and how many were in the street below. The accident occurred Thursday in the working-class district of <LOCATION> Karmouz </LOCATION> as a wedding group was passing through the streets of this <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> port city. Balconies overlooking the street were crammed with onlookers, many of whom danced and clapped as the newlyweds led the procession, according to police. The stone balcony of a four-story house suddenly crashed to the street below, apparently because it was overloaded, the official said. He reported the bride and bridegroom were not injured.

 <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s Roman Catholic primate, <PERSON> Jozef </PERSON> <PERSON> Glemp </PERSON>, has called for mutual understanding to resolve conflict over a convent next to the <LOCATION> Auschwitz </LOCATION> concentration camp. In an interview published in the <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> weekly <ORGANIZATION> Tygodnik </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Powszechny </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Glemp </PERSON> said it might be possible to renegotiate agreements to relocate the convent farther from the former <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> death camp. The Carmelite convent is at the center of a controversy between some Catholics and Jews over an agreement reached in 1987 under which <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> negotiators agreed to move the convent to a nearby interfaith prayer center by Feb. 22. <PERSON> Glemp </PERSON> continues to back the convent, which was established in 1984 in a building the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION> used to store gas to kill Jews and other death-canp inmates. He has said the agreement, signed in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>, was not negotiated by `` competent people'' In the interview published Friday <PERSON> Glemp </PERSON> said Jews should help <PERSON> Catholics </PERSON> become better acquainted with Jewish views on the issue. `` Let mutual understanding be the common intention,'' he said. On Friday, <PERSON> Glemp </PERSON> met with the head of a fund that restores Jewish monuments in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> to discuss a possible resolution to the international controversy, the state news agency, <ORGANIZATION> PAP </ORGANIZATION>, reported. No details were provided but <ORGANIZATION> PAP </ORGANIZATION> said `` a draft of a satisfying solution of the <LOCATION> Auschwitz </LOCATION> conflict was shaped.'' <PERSON> Zygmunt </PERSON> <PERSON> Nissenbaum </PERSON>, with whom <PERSON> Glemp </PERSON> met, maintains a family philanthropic fund. The proposals worked out by the two `` will be carried further by an appropriate group that will handle concrete realization'' of building the interfaith center, <ORGANIZATION> PAP </ORGANIZATION> said. In the interview, <PERSON> Glemp </PERSON> spoke of his earlier remarks that were considered anti-Semitic by some Jewish leaders. `` Some of the press reactions -LRB- to the sermon -RRB- made me realize that several of my opinions were interpreted contrary to my intentions,'' he said. `` I thought the whole of my enunciation on the need for friendly dialogue between Catholics and Jews is sufficently clear.'' Some Jewish groups and others consider the convent to be an intrusion of Christian symbols at the former concentration camp where 2.5 million of the estimated 4 million people killed were Jews. At one point during the interview the interviewer said it is `` better to move it -LRB- the convent -RRB- 1 @ 3 of a mile away in tune with the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> settlements. It is no tragedy and the Lord will hear their prayer from a new place as well.'' <PERSON> Glemp </PERSON> replied, `` Of course.''

 <LOCATION> PORT-OF-SPAIN </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Trinidad </LOCATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- _ The government announced it will put soldiers on street patrol to help fight the drug-related violence that has plagued this <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> nation for months. Justice and National Security Minister <PERSON> Selwyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON> said late Friday that the move was to `` assist the police to curb the spate of lawlessness with which the society is being afflicted.'' He said the decision came in reaction to a Sept. 7 assassination attempt against the wife of <LOCATION> Trinidad </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Noor </PERSON> <PERSON> Hassanaly </PERSON> and the killing a month ago of <PERSON> Jeffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Stollmeyer </PERSON>, a prominent businessman. The president's wife, <PERSON> Zaylahar </PERSON> <PERSON> Hassanaly </PERSON>, was not injured when gunmen peppered her limousine with automatic gunfire. The motive for the attack was unknown. For several months <LOCATION> Trinidad </LOCATION> <LOCATION> and </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Tobago </LOCATION>, a country of 1.1 million off the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> coast, has been suffered a wave of murders, violent robberies and rapes. `` The present criminality definitely relates to the rise in the availability of drugs,'' <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON> said in his remarks. He said the government of Prime Minister A.N.R. <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> has decided on an `` anti-crime action plan to take effect immediately.'' He said the plan includes 24-hour police and army street patrols, an increase in coast guard patrols to intercept drug runners, and the recruitment of 150 more police officers. During the past 12 months, the government has passed laws aimed at confiscating property and money gained through drug trafficking and limiting bail for people convicted of violent crimes.

<HEAD>Report: Iowa Firing Experimental Ammmunition at Time of Explosion</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RICHMOND, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The USS Iowa was being used as a floating laboratory for high-explosive experiments, and crewmen were using improper gun powder when the No. 2 turret exploded and killed 47 men, a news service reported. Transcripts from the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> investigation into the April 19 battleship explosion showed also that the commander, Capt. <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Moosally </PERSON>, had not authorized the firing with experimental loads when the explosion occurred, <ORGANIZATION> Media </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> reported Sunday. The investigation also showed that the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> command that requested the experiments was the same command that performed the tests that led the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> to conclude that the explosion was likely an act of sabotage by a sailor. The <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> released a report in early September that said circumstantial evidence indicated gunner's mate <PERSON> Clayton </PERSON> <PERSON> Hartwig </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION> intentionally sparked the explosion. However, the report said it would be impossible to prove because all those nearby died in the explosion, including <PERSON> Hartwig </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>, when contacted by The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> on Saturday, stood by its conclusion. `` Everything was very carefully considered,'' said Cmdr. <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> spokesman at the Pentagon. According to the 7,007-page report, which was available to the public, the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> found that gunners were firing an experimental load from the <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>'s No. 2 turret with powder not approved for the weight of the projectile. The powder was clearly marked that it not be used with the heavyweight projectiles being fired, the report said. The experiments were at the request of researchers at the <ORGANIZATION> Naval </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sea </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION> at the Naval Surface Warfare Center at <LOCATION> Dahlgren </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va </LOCATION>. According to the transcripts, the tests were designed to improve the accuracy and range of the ship's antiquated 16-inch guns. Commander <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kocmich </PERSON>, who was the <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>'s weapons officer between 1986 and 1988, told <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> investigators that the experiments alarmed a number of officers on the ship, who did n't think a fully manned battleship was meant to be a research and development vessel. They argued that tests should be conducted under safer conditions. To fulfill the experiments, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> gunners tried reducing the powder load by using five bags instead of the normal six. Master Chief S.P. <PERSON> Skelly </PERSON>, who was in charge of the experiments, had discovered that using just five bags improved the accuracy of the guns. `` I knew they did n't have any authorization,'' said Lt. Cmdr. <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Costigan </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>'s gunnery officer. `` I think there were big signs down in the magazines, ` You can not use D-846 with heavyweight projectiles.' It was pretty clear what the rules were.'' But <PERSON> Costigan </PERSON> said he never did anything about it. <PERSON> Moosally </PERSON> said that on the day of the explosion, he did not know a five-bag charge was going to be used in Turret 2 or that <ORGANIZATION> Turret </ORGANIZATION> 3 _ which never fired because of the explosion _ was loaded with an even more innovative four-bag charge. <PERSON> Moosally </PERSON> told investigators he approved the use of a `` reduced charge,'' but said he thought that meant six 55-pound bags of powder. The combination of experimentation on the <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, and the high turnover, inexperience and poor management on board, initially attracted the attention of investigators looking into the explosion. The investigators had been pursuing the theory that <PERSON> Hartwig </PERSON>, who took over as gun captain in a last-minute roster change, perhaps was confused by seeing only five bags of powder pop out from the powder cars instead of six, and that somehow in the confusion the powder got rammed into the barrel too quickly, splitting a bag open when it crashed into the projectile, its volatile powder set off by friction. The friction theory was eliminated by a series of technical tests under the direction of the Naval Sea Systems Command. The discovery of a $ 100,000 life insurance policy taken out by <PERSON> Hartwig </PERSON>, naming a shipmate as beneficiary, put the investigation on a new course. Media General, a communications company based in <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION>, publishes the <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION> Times-Dispatch, the Richmond News Leader, the <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION> -LRB- <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION> -RRB- <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION> and the <LOCATION> Winston-Salem </LOCATION> -LRB- <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION> -RRB- Journal, and operates TV station <ORGANIZATION> WXFL </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION>, WCBD in <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> WJKS </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Jacksonville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla </LOCATION>.

 Funerals were held Saturday for victims of Thursday's massacre at a printing plant, with a chorus singing, `` Nearer My God To Thee,'' for a slain choir member. The Thoroughbred Chorus performed at the funeral for <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Wible </PERSON>, a long-time chorus member who was among the shooting victims at <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gravure </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> where he worked for 37 years. <PERSON> Wible </PERSON>'s funeral was the first held for the seven victims of <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wesbecker </PERSON>, a deranged co-worker who entered the building spraying bullets from an arsenal he had been collecting during the past few months. Eleven of the 13 people injured by <PERSON> Wesbecker </PERSON> during the rampage remained hospitalized Saturday, two of them in critical condition. <PERSON> Wesbecker </PERSON>, who turned a pistol on himself to end the shooting spree, did not have a formal funeral. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Longest </PERSON>, an official at <ORGANIZATION> Owen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Funeral </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Louisville </LOCATION> said Saturday that the body was embalmed and taken away. Longest said <PERSON> Wesbecker </PERSON>'s family asked that no other information be divulged. Reporters were barred from Saturday's services. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Burgess </PERSON>, a chorus member who attended <PERSON> Wible </PERSON>'s funeral, said the Rev. <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> Templar </PERSON> made only a few references to the violence that caused <PERSON> Wible </PERSON>'s death. <PERSON> Burgess </PERSON> said <PERSON> Templar </PERSON>'s eulogy stressed that `` God's will is about love and not about violence.'' Chorus members also sang `` The Lord's Prayer'' and `` I Thank the Lord.'' <PERSON> Wible </PERSON> was to be buried in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>. Funeral services were also held Saturday for <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> O. </PERSON> <PERSON> Barger </PERSON>, 54, a pressman for 32 years; and a service was scheduled for Saturday evening for <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON> <PERSON> L.L </PERSON>. Needy, 49, a receptionist at the downtown plant, which prints newspaper inserts. Funerals for the other four victims were scheduled for Monday. Among those attending <PERSON> Wible </PERSON>'s funeral was <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Shea </PERSON>, the owner of <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gravure </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Shea </PERSON>, who appeared very upset, did not say anything after the ceremony, but consoled <PERSON> Wible </PERSON>'s family members and friends. Meanwhile, <PERSON> Wesbecker </PERSON>'s son <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Wesbecker </PERSON> blamed <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gravure </ORGANIZATION> for the mental problems that his father suffered. `` Maybe this was just his way of ending it,'' the younger <PERSON> Wesbecker </PERSON> said in an interview Friday with the <ORGANIZATION> Lexington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald-Leader </ORGANIZATION>. `` I do n't want to say much about the company, about the people at the top. Maybe they did n't know what was really going on. I'm not sure. `` But I feel like, over the years, the company created my dad,'' he continued. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Wesbecker </PERSON>, 22, is one of <PERSON> Wesbecker </PERSON>'s two grown sons by his first marriage. <PERSON> Wesbecker </PERSON> was on long-term disability from the company because of his mental problems. Relatives have told police he was a manic depressive who had attempted suicide three times. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Wesbecker </PERSON> said his father feared the company was planning to take away some of his benefits. `` He was really afraid of that,'' the younger <PERSON> Wesbecker </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Shea </PERSON> said Friday that he knew of no meeting company officials had planned with <PERSON> Wesbecker </PERSON> and refused to comment on what he called `` the speculaton, rumors and innuendo'' about <PERSON> Wesbecker </PERSON>'s relationship with the company, where he went to work in 1971 Meanwhile, the shooting began a debate in <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> over regulations on assault weapons of the type <PERSON> Wesbecker </PERSON> used. When he entered the printing plant, <PERSON> Wesbecker </PERSON> was armed with a Chinese-made AK-47 semiautomatic rifle, two MAC-11 semiautomatic weapons, a revolver and a 9mm semiautomatic pistol. Two <LOCATION> Louisville </LOCATION> legislators said they will introduce a bill in the 1990 <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> to ban the sale of AK-47 rifles and similar assault weapons. <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> lawmakers are in general so strongly against gun controls that there is a state law that bars cities and towns from passing gun control ordinances. State Rep. <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> acknowledged that passage of a gun-control law would be difficult. `` But I think we owe it to the families of the victims, and the surviving victims, to try to make it at least harder to obtain assault weapons,'' <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> said.

 A woman who police said was abducted and drugged then found five days later wandering a <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> beach was among six people killed when the plane carrying them to her `` quiet homecoming'' crashed and burned. <PERSON> Belinda </PERSON> <PERSON> Yancey </PERSON>, 33, and five other people, including her husband, died Friday night when the airplane's wing struck a tree and went down near the <LOCATION> Mayfield-Graves </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> airport in southwestern <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>, authorities said. `` As far as people going through one tragedy and then all getting killed, I've never seen anything like that before,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Kentucky </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> Lt. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Finck </PERSON>, who was at the crash site Saturday. Ms. <PERSON> Yancey </PERSON>, who taught hearing impaired students at <ORGANIZATION> Mayfield </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, disappeared sometime after 2:30 p.m. Monday, when she told her son that she was going to <ORGANIZATION> Murray </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>'s bookstore, said police Capt. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Crawford </PERSON>. Her car has not been found. She wandered up to a lifeguard on a beach at <LOCATION> Daytona </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, on Thursday afternoon and said she was lost, police said. Based on statements she made to <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> authorities, Ms. <PERSON> Yancey </PERSON> seemed to have been drugged with Valium by her abductor, who remained at large, <PERSON> Crawford </PERSON> said. Ms. <PERSON> Yancey </PERSON> told authorities that `` they kept giving me little blue pills,'' <PERSON> Crawford </PERSON> said. In interviews with authorities and relatives, she could not recall how she got to <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> and was unable to identify who drove her there, <PERSON> Crawford </PERSON> said. Ms. <PERSON> Yancey </PERSON>'s hair had been cut and dyed and she had bruises on her arms, indicating she was tied up or restrained, he said.

 Two bombs, one thrown from a motorcycle and a second from a car, exploded in downtown <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION> Saturday as the government tightened security to quell the wave of violence. Two pedestrians were injured when the devices exploded at about 5 p.m. in front of two banks, which were closed, a police spokeswoman said. The banks, <ORGANIZATION> Banco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> de </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Santander </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Banco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Popular </ORGANIZATION>, are in the <LOCATION> Paloquemao </LOCATION> area of central <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION>. No one claimed responsibility for the bombings but it is believed they were connected to the drug-related violence that began four weeks ago when the government announced its crackdown on drug traffickers. Meanwhile, hundreds of soldiers patrolled city streets and searched cars for weapons and explosives. Police said nine people were killed and 15 wounded in widespread violence Friday. <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> celebrated its `` Day of Love and Friendship'' _ the equivalent of Valentine's Day. But shopping centers, usually filled with people buying last minute gifts for the holiday, were nearly deserted. Americans continued to pull out of <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> for fear they could be caught up in the month-long war between drug traffickers and the <LOCATION> Colombian </LOCATION> government. About 20 American passengers boarding flights Saturday for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> told a reporter they feared for their lives. In the last two weeks, outgoing flights have been filled with Americans. Two weeks ago, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> ordered dependents of American employees out of the country. A bomb was deactivated at the <ORGANIZATION> Colgate-Palmolive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>'s headquarters in the western <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> city of Cali Thursday night, police Col. <PERSON> Rozo </PERSON> <PERSON> Julio </PERSON> <PERSON> Navarro </PERSON> told The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> Three bombs exploded Friday night in <LOCATION> Cali </LOCATION>, injuring 13 people, <PERSON> Navarro </PERSON> said. The bombs went off in a high-rise building and damaged three banks and 12 stores, he said. No one claimed responsibility but police suspected the drug cartels. On Saturday the army, declaring a maximum alert, put troops and armor into the streets of <LOCATION> Colombian </LOCATION> cities in the greatest display of military muscle seen in years here. Troops were patrolling <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION>, the cocaine cartel centers of <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Cali </LOCATION>, and the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> coastal cities of <LOCATION> Cartagena </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Barranquilla </LOCATION>. Early in the morning, hundreds of troops in trucks poured out of the army's 13th Brigade headquarters in northern <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION>. Foot patrols were seen throughout the capital of 6 million. Soldiers searched people, mostly men, in downtown <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION>, and the army and police set up checkpoints to search vehicles for guns and explosives. For the first time, <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s national police acknowledged numerous telephoned threats to people in <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION> and said the telephone company is setting up an operation to trace such calls. Troops also were deployed to guard banks and government buildings. Banks are frequent targets of the nation's powerful cocaine traffickers, who have declared `` total and absolute war'' on the government. That declaration and the Aug. 18 assassination of leading presidential candidate Sen. <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Galan </PERSON> prompted the crackdown on drug lords. At <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dorado </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>, police closed off all but two entrances and were frisking people and searching bags. Police Col. <PERSON> Nassin </PERSON> <PERSON> Yanine </PERSON> <PERSON> Diaz </PERSON>, commander of the <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION> division of the national police, appealed in a communique Saturday for people to remain calm and `` have confidence in the armed forces.'' A similar communique was issued by the 13th Brigade. Two policemen were killed by gunfire from a speeding car Friday night in <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION>, said a spokesman for national police headquarters in the capital. As in most bombings and shootings throughout this country of 30 million, police said they had no idea who was behind the violence. Drug traffickers have been widely blamed but leftist guerrillas seeking to topple the government have waged their own campaign of violence. In the central <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> state of <LOCATION> Boyaca </LOCATION>, just north of the capital, seven men were killed Friday in violence involving bandits battling for control of <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s emerald mines, the national police in <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION> said. Drug traffickers are believed to be heavily involved in the 20-year-old struggle for control of the emerald mines. Also in <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION>, a gunman firing from a car shot at the building of the <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION> daily <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Siglo </ORGANIZATION> Friday night, the <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION> police said. An <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Siglo </ORGANIZATION> executive said one shot was fired in the air by a man who became angry when he was stopped by guards checking vehicles entering the <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Siglo </LOCATION> parking area. The man and a passenger fled in the car, the <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Siglo </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said, asking not to be identified. No one was reported injured. A bomb seriously damaged the <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION> daily <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Espectador </ORGANIZATION> on Sept. 2. The paper's publisher, <PERSON> Guillermo </PERSON> <PERSON> Cano </PERSON>, was assassinated by drug traffickers three years ago. In <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION>, a bomb exploded near a police vehicle Friday night, injuring two policemen, police said in a telephone interview. Thirty-two bombs have exploded in <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> Since Aug. 21. Last week the army said it had arrested 28 persons in <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> on suspicion of being leftist guerrillas and of setting off some of the bombs that have exploded there.

 As the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s new $ 1.2 billion destroyer <PERSON> Arleigh </PERSON> <PERSON> Burke </PERSON> was launched Saturday, officials took turns firing return salvos at a congressman who called the ship's construction a `` procurement nightmare.'' `` Irresponsible attitudes like that hurt but ... do n't take them too seriously,'' Rep. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Maine </LOCATION>, told a crowd estimated at more than 10,000 people who attended the launching at Bath Iron Works. The <PERSON> Burke </PERSON> is named for an 87-year-old retired admiral and World War II hero who arrived at the launching in a 1930 Packard. <PERSON> Burke </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Roberta </PERSON>, broke a bottle of champagne over the bow, sending the 8,500-ton destroyer sliding toward the <LOCATION> Kennebec </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> Construction of the ship, considered the most technologically advanced surface combat vessel, has prompted complaints of cost overruns by Rep. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Dingell </PERSON>, D-Mich. <PERSON> Dingell </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee on oversight and investigations, told the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> that the program is 18 months behind schedule and that the DDG-51 destroyer is only 38 percent complete `` The acquisition of the DDG-51 has turned into a procurement nightmare,'' his letter said. Bath Iron Works rejected <PERSON> Dingell </PERSON>'s assertions, which were based on a draft report from the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>, which is conducting an inquiry into the program. <PERSON> Dingell </PERSON>'s `` numbers are wrong, his facts are wrong and his so-called news in nearly two years old,'' said <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON>. `` That number of errors in not good even for congressional work.'' <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Haggett </PERSON>, chairman and chief executive officer of <ORGANIZATION> Bath </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Iron </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Works </ORGANIZATION>, said Thursday that the DDG-51 is `` 47 to 51 percent complete, a higher level than we launched our previous prototype ship.'' `` The ship is ready in every respect to be launched,'' said <PERSON> Haggett </PERSON>.

The guided-missile destroyer is designed with a steel superstructure instead of one that is part aluminum and more prone to splintering and fire damage. It will be equipped with sophisticated Aegis computers and Tomahawk cruise missiles. <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Garrett </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> said the ship `` represents the very future of surface warfare.''

 Explorers recovering gold that may value more than $ 400 million from a sunken ship off the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> coast said Saturday they also may have found two previously unknown species of marine life. Researchers using remote-control equipment gathered samples of the two organisms, apparently invertebrate animals, attached to remnants of the SS <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> at a depth of 8,000 feet, said <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Schatz </PERSON>, a director of the <ORGANIZATION> Columbus-America </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Discovery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>. The creatures will be studied on board and later taken ashore for further study, said <PERSON> Schatz </PERSON>, who spoke with The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> in a ship-to-shore telephone conversation from the Arctic Discoverer research vessel 200 miles offshore. The Central America sank during a hurricane Sept. 12, 1857, en route from <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. It was carrying a monthly shipment of gold from the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mint </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> banks by way of the Panamanian isthmus. The sinking claimed 425 lives; 153 people survived. Remnants of the wood and iron ship, discovered three years ago, lie on a section of ocean floor that <PERSON> Schatz </PERSON> said is a `` biological oasis'' in the midst of an otherwise barren area. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Herdendorf </PERSON>, an oceanographer from <ORGANIZATION> Ohio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> who heads an onboard research team, said scientists have been trying to informally catalogue marine life seen around the wreck through television cameras. `` But these two were just total mysteries to me,'' he said in a ship-to-shore conversation. `` These looked really new.'' Conversations with specialists at the <ORGANIZATION> Smithsonian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institution </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> heightened belief that the creatures were previously unknown, <PERSON> Herdendorf </PERSON> said. Both appear to be invertebrate animals similar to sponge or coral. They grow on stalks about eight to 10 inches long and may be part of the same family, he said. One consists of a narrow stalk that ends in plumes or polyps. The other has a coin-sized, fleshy growth extending off a central stalk. `` It may be the same organism in various life stages or it may be two different species,'' he said. The group planned to spend Saturday on scientific research, <PERSON> Schatz </PERSON> and <PERSON> Herdendorf </PERSON> said. In addition to collecting the two organisms, <PERSON> Schatz </PERSON> said, the group hopes also to catch other animals with traps baited with lobster from the group's dinner, scrape animals from the wreck hull and take a core sample of the sea floor. Though the first of the gold was found in August 1988, the Arctic Discoverer and its 21-member crew did not find the main gold deposit until Aug. 27 this year, after about a month at sea. <PERSON> Schatz </PERSON> said the team may be at sea for another month, and hopes to have the bulk of the gold up by then. As an offshoot of the commercial enterprise of recovering the gold, the group established an adjunct sciences program, headed by <PERSON> Herdendorf </PERSON>. More than a dozen researchers are now involved in the project, including scientists from the Smithsonian. `` The economic payoff is what pays for the science,'' <PERSON> Schatz </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Herdendorf </PERSON> said the group hopes to produce educational films and distribute their findings throughout the scientific community. `` It's really a dream. I guess the dream of all biologist is to find new life forms and advance the horizons of science. We're probably just beginning,'' <PERSON> Herdendorf </PERSON> said

<HEAD>Polish Party Daily Says Soviets Repressed Millions</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> newspaper Saturday said the Soviet invasion of <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> in 1939 led to repression and crimes against millions of Poles. The paper, <PERSON> Trybuna </PERSON> <PERSON> Ludu </PERSON>, said the truth about the invasion must be told before Polish-Soviet relations can be put on a new basis. `` The date of Sept. 17 is deeply rooted in the consciousness of the Polish nation. Especially because the entering of Soviet troops was followed by growing repressions, and even mass crimes, which involved millions of Poles,'' the paper said. On Sunday, <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> marks the 50th anniversary of the Soviet invasion, which came more than two weeks after the <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> army entered <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> at the outbreak of World War II. <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> had agreed to divide <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> into spheres of influence under secret protocols in the Ribbentrop-Molotov non-aggression pact on Aug. 23 of that year. Soviet troops are thought to have killed tens of thousands of Poles during the war. Another 1.5 million were deported to <LOCATION> Siberia </LOCATION> during the Soviet occupation. `` The crossing by the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> into the eastern borders of <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> ... belonged for decades in our country to the most taboo subjects,'' the paper said. `` If Sept. 1 was the beginning of a cataclysm for <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and later for the world, then Sept. 17 that year symbolizes a secondary blow that fell on our nation and the consequences of which were also enormous and tragic.'' Although Nazi aggression has been well publicized, the Soviet invasion was rarely mentioned in the official press for decades. It was, however, well documented in the unofficial or underground press. `` The truth about those events is deserved not only by the victims of the repressions, their descendents, the whole nation, but it is one of the important tasks in freeing Polish-Soviet relations,'' <PERSON> Trybuna </PERSON> <PERSON> Ludu </PERSON> said. Ceremonies were planned Sunday at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier in <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION>, and there will be other smaller commemorations nationwide. Two years ago, a joint Polish-Soviet commission was set up to investigate `` blank spots'' in history such as the massacre of Polish officers at <LOCATION> Katyn </LOCATION>, the Soviet invasion of <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, and the 1920 Polish-Soviet war. Last Aug. 23, deputies in the lower house of parliament passed a resolution condemning the Molotov-Ribbentrop pact as `` shameful.'' Earlier, the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> had condemned the secret protocols as `` a flagrant violation'' of international law.

 Congressman <PERSON> Barney </PERSON> <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> says he would consider not running again if a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> ethics probe of his relations with a male prostitute damages the causes he considers important in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. `` Do other people who share my values pay a price if I am here?'' said the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Democrat. `` If that's so, then I would not run for office.'' <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> conceded in an interview with <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Globe </ORGANIZATION> _ conducted in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and published Saturday _ that disclosures about his relationship with <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gobie </PERSON> have already diminished his influence on some of the liberal causes he has supported. A <ORGANIZATION> Newsweek </ORGANIZATION> poll released Saturday showed 46 percent of Americans said <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> should n't be re-elected because of the scandal. Forty-five percent said they would vote against any homosexual candidate for office, according to the poll of 600 adults interviewed Sept. 14 and 15. The same poll found 60 percent of <LOCATION> Americans </LOCATION> believe that being a homosexual should n't keep a person from being a member of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and 50 percent said homosexuality should n't keep a person from being president. The poll has a 4 percent margin of error. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>'s disclosure of his homosexuality in 1987 did n't prevent him for gaining 70 percent of the votes in his 1988 re-election bid. He represents a predominantly <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> district that encompasses parts of southeastern <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> and some <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> suburbs. The <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Globe </ORGANIZATION>, in an editorial in Sunday's editions, urged <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> to resign for `` his own good, and for the good of his constituents, his causes and <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Globe </ORGANIZATION> noted that it had `` enthusiastically endorsed <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> throughout his public career,'' but said revelations about <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> and his relationship with <PERSON> Gobie </PERSON> had led it to conclude `` <PERSON> Barney </PERSON> <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> must go.'' `` The issue of <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>'s conduct is not homosexuality but prostitution, which is illegal and which has always been a destructive element in heterosexual and homosexual life,'' the newspaper said. `` Had the issue been heterosexual prostitution, feminist groups would not have been silent. So far, <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> has enjoyed more than the benefit of the doubt, he has enjoyed a double standard.'' In the interview, <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> said that if he retired, he would practice law and do some writing, but would continue to be involved in such issues as housing, AIDS and homosexual rights. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> said he believes most people will agree with his contention that his activities with <PERSON> Gobie </PERSON> involved only his personal life and did not spill over into his work as a member of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. `` My impact on people who do n't know me has been diminished some,'' <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> said. `` As public spokesman, there will be a period that I will have to reestablish.'' <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> said he has decided to step back from the issue of the scandal in the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION>, on which he has worked recently. `` On that one, I think it is appropriate that I pull back until I get my own ethics matter resolved,'' he said. The House Committee on Standards of Official Conduct has begun a preliminary inquiry that is expected to take up to three months. The study centers on <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>'s hiring of <PERSON> Gobie </PERSON>, whom he once patronized for paid sex, as his aide and chauffeur, allowing <PERSON> Gobie </PERSON> access to his apartment; <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>'s writing of several letters on official stationery to <PERSON> Gobie </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> probation officer; and <PERSON> Gobie </PERSON>'s contention that <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> fixed up to 100 parking tickets for him.

More rain fell overnight, and scattered showers were reported Saturday night. `` We've got more people coming in to prepare sandbags and environmental services folks are coming in to unclog the drains, and buses are coming in for possible evacuation procedures,'' city spokesman <PERSON> Jason </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> said. Police Lt. C.P. <PERSON> Ware </PERSON> said water was still draining in some areas of the eastern <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> city of 60,000. But he said `` everything's calmed down'' compared to Friday night. However, three rescue teams consisting of divers and police dog units searched Saturday to make sure no one else drowned, <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> said. `` Just a few minutes ago they pulled a car out of some water that had two people in it,'' <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> said early Saturday. The two people were not injured. Rescuers saved five people who clutched at branches in a rain-swollen creek after they tried to escape their flooded van, but two children, ages 6 and 4, who were in the vehicle were swept away and drowned. `` All my life in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, I've never seen anything like it,'' said <LOCATION> Cumberland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Deputy <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, one of those who formed a human chain and used ropes to save three adults and one child Friday night. A fourth adult was washed about 100 yards downstream before she was rescued. Their van was struck by water overflowing a nearby dam. The water was flowing over the van when law enforcement officials arrived, <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said. Water stood more than 3 feet deep on the road and more than 6 feet deep in the creek, <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said. At least 400 people were evacuated, some in boats, and were in temporary shelters Saturday at a gymnasium, an armory and a church, officials said. The evacuees included more than 160 people taken from a nursing home, said <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, spokesman for the state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Crime </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION>. Soldiers coming through town on their way to <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bragg </LOCATION> for a military exercise were blocked by the high water and helped with the nursing home evacuation, said Mayor J.L. <PERSON> Dawkins </PERSON>. `` They played a big role in that with equipment and manpower right there on the spot,'' <PERSON> Dawkins </PERSON> said. Police used city buses to evacuate residents living within a half-mile radius of <LOCATION> Glenville </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION>, which overflowed its dam in the <LOCATION> Mazarick </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> area. The main post office in downtown <LOCATION> Fayetteville </LOCATION> was without power. `` The generators which are in the basement were completely flooded out,'' said postal spokesman <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Odom </PERSON>. `` We did get some mail out, a very limited amount. Carriers will be running today, however they will not have the mail that they should have.'' To the north, creeks were swollen by more than 3 inches of rain Saturday in parts of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, forcing some families to leave their homes and drowning two people, authorities said. Weather service meteorologist <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Park </PERSON> said flooding was reported in several counties in th southern and western parts of the state. <ORGANIZATION> Appalachian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Shaver </PERSON> said 2,000 customers lost power early Saturday but service to more than half of them was restored by midday. The drownings were both in <LOCATION> Kanawha </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, which includes the capital city of <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION>. A 30-year-old woman drowned when the truck in which she was riding was caught by a swollen creek and lodged against a bridge abutment, state police said. The driver `` jumped out and he tried to get her out. But he could n't get her out,'' said Sgt. G.L. <PERSON> Clark </PERSON>. A man who was checking to make sure no one was trapped in their homes drowned when he was swept away by high water in the <LOCATION> Alum </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Creek </LOCATION> area, said <LOCATION> Kanawha </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Manager <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON>.

 Seven coal miners were buried Saturday, and an investigation into the explosion that killed them and three others was delayed again because of dangerous levels of methane gas, authorities said. The methane gas was in the area where the explosion is believed to have occurred, said <PERSON> Kathy </PERSON> <PERSON> Snyder </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Mine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>. Ms. <PERSON> Snyder </PERSON> said federal and state investigators conducting a preliminary check of the mine Thursday found `` explosive levels'' of methane. The <ORGANIZATION> MSHA </ORGANIZATION> then approved <PERSON> Pyro </PERSON>'s plan for correcting the levels, but, `` So far they have been unable to clear up the methane problem. And they're still in the process of doing that,'' Ms. <PERSON> Snyder </PERSON> said. `` Until that happens, the investigation will be on hold,'' she said. `` The methane levels are too dangerous.'' She did not know how long that would take. On Friday, <PERSON> Willard </PERSON> <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON>, commissioner of the state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Minerals </ORGANIZATION>, said a blowtorch found near the site of the explosion was most likely what ignited the blast. The Pyro mine has been cited for 1,508 violations and assessed $ 215,757 in fines over the past seven years, according to <ORGANIZATION> MSHA </ORGANIZATION>. About $ 53,000 was assessed this year. Funeral services began in the morning in <LOCATION> Madisonville </LOCATION> and continued throughout the day in western <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>. One funeral was held in <LOCATION> Morganfield </LOCATION>, two in <LOCATION> Madisonville </LOCATION>, another in <LOCATION> Muhlenberg </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, and others in <LOCATION> Nortonville </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Salem </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hedges </PERSON>, 31, of <LOCATION> Morganfield </LOCATION>, one of the 10 miners killed Wednesday at <ORGANIZATION> Pyro </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mining </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> William </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Station </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mine </ORGANIZATION> in neighboring <PERSON> Wheatcroft </PERSON>, was buried Friday. The other two victims were scheduled for burial Sunday in <LOCATION> Providence </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Madisonville </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Madisonville </LOCATION>, about 250 people packed a funeral home chapel, two family rooms and the hallway for funeral services for <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>, 39, of <LOCATION> Providence </LOCATION>. The scene was repeated at the <ORGANIZATION> Whitsell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Funeral </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Morganfield </LOCATION>, where about 150 to 200 people paid tribute to <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Clifford </PERSON>, 32, of <LOCATION> Morganfield </LOCATION>.

 More than 11,000 union supporters rallied at the state Capitol to protest the hiring of non-union construction workers at the <ORGANIZATION> Boise </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cascade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> paper mill in International Falls, the site of a riot last week. Also Saturday, a state lawmaker said he would introduce a bill to repeal a $ 16 million tax exemption <ORGANIZATION> Boise </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cascade </ORGANIZATION> is eligible to receive from the state; and 200 to 300 people attended a peace rally in International Falls to oppose violence in connection with the labor dispute. The Sept. 9 riot at the International Falls plant caused more than $ 1 million in damage at the $ 535 million expansion project and resulted in five minor injuries and 29 arrests. No violence was reported in <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Falls </LOCATION> on Saturday, police said, and the <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paul </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Falls </ORGANIZATION> rallies were peaceful. Several protesters carried signs praising Gov. <PERSON> Rudy </PERSON> <PERSON> Perpich </PERSON> for supporting union labor and for not sending the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> to the riot. <PERSON> Perpich </PERSON> has been criticized by <LOCATION> Boise </LOCATION> and the contractor for the expansion for not deploying the Guard. More than 11,000 people attended the rally, according to Capt. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, director of Capitol security. Thousands of rallygoers, including many children, carried signs protesting <ORGANIZATION> Boise </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cascade </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> BE </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; K, the contractor who hired the non-union workers. A few said, `` Go home scabs,'' `` $ 16 million for education, not rats,'' and `` My dad's union and I'm proud.'' Anti-Boise Cascade buttons were being sold for $ 5 each, with the proceeds to pay for legal help for the people arrested in the riot. In International Falls on the Canadian border, 200 to 300 people gathered at <LOCATION> Smokey </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bear </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> to show their opposition to violence in connection with the labor dispute. `` We will not tolerate the violence that seeks to tear apart our community,'' the Rev. <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Megorden </PERSON> told the crowd in <LOCATION> Smokey </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bear </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>, across from the <LOCATION> Boise </LOCATION> plant. `` None of us want to see neighbor torn against neighbor, brother against brother,'' <PERSON> Megorden </PERSON> said. Most speakers at the hourlong rally in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paul </LOCATION>, including <ORGANIZATION> Minnesota </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Gustafson </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> Building Trades Council President <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Peterson </PERSON>, said they did not condone the violence by pro-union activists last weekend. But they said the rioting occurred because <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> union workers are frustrated over the hiring of non-union, out-of-state workers at the expansion project, even as <LOCATION> Boise </LOCATION> became eligible to receive the tax break. `` How has <LOCATION> Boise </LOCATION> used this tax credit?'' <PERSON> Peterson </PERSON> told the crowd. `` To hire BE & amp; K, a non-union contractor from <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>, and to subsidize the importation of non-union workers from 22 different states who took jobs that rightfully belong to Minnesotans. State Rep. <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Begich </PERSON> told rallygoers he would introduce a bill to repeal the tax exemption during a planned special legislative session on property tax issues this month.

<HEAD>Newspaper Says Nixon Planned Hostage Rescue</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A newspaper reported Sunday that former President <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> tried to organize a mission to rescue 52 American hostages in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> in 1980 shortly after President <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>'s attempt failed However, the Sunday Telegraph's report said it was not clear if <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> intended to launch an independent mission or an official one that would be carried out under the presidency of <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. In any event, the newspaper said the idea was dropped in October 1980 when <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> announced that the hostages at the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> would be released after the inauguration of a new president. The weekly newspaper said <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> held secret talks with British helicopter pilots and ex-servicemen only three months after the first attempted rescue in April 1980. He met the chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Bristow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Helicopters </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Bristow </PERSON>, and several former members of the <ORGANIZATION> Special </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, according to the newspaper. The <ORGANIZATION> SAS </ORGANIZATION> is <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s elite military assault force. `` <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> was absolutely serious,'' the newspaper quoted <PERSON> Bristow </PERSON> as saying. `` We had a long and detailed discussion about the chances of success of a second strike. I told him it could be done, but the strike force would suffer at least 30 percent casualties.'' A rescue attempt authorized by <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> ended in disaster April 25, 1980, when a helicopter collided with a tanker aircraft in an Iranian desert, killing eight servicemen. The Sunday Telegraph quoted unidentified security sources as saying the second mission was conceived by the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> because it feared its presidential candidate, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, might inherit the hostage crisis if he won the election. The American hostages where freed in January 1981 after 444 days in captivity. The British account reported a <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> aide said, `` We will neither confirm nor deny this story. We have nothing to say.'' It did not identify the aide. The newspaper said <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>'s plan was inspired by the <ORGANIZATION> SAS </ORGANIZATION> assault on gunmen holding hostages at the <LOCATION> Iranian </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> on May 5, 1980. Four of the five gunmen were killed in the operation, which succeeded in freeing the hostages.

<TEXT>
 British agents planted propaganda in <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> newspapers, harassed political enemies in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and labor unions and waged economic warfare in this country in the years before <LOCATION> Pearl </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION>, according to a secret history quoted by the <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> in Sunday editions. Agents headed by Sir <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Stephenson </PERSON>, celebrated in the 1976 book, `` A Man Called Intrepid,'' waged their campaign out of an office in Rockefeller Center in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> known as British Security Coordination, the history said. The <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> said 10 leatherbound copies of the 423-page document prepared in 1945 were said to have been distributed but that none have surfaced until now. The newspaper said it was allowed to take extensive notes on a copy of the history but did not name its source. Several American newspaper publishers as well as columnists <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Lippmann </PERSON>, <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Winchell </PERSON> and <PERSON> Drew </PERSON> <PERSON> Pearson </PERSON> were described as helpful to the British effort to discredit isolationism and harass Nazi sympathizers. The history portrays <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> on the eve of World War II as easy to manipulate. `` These people, though fully conscious of their wealth and power in the aggregate, are still unsure of themselves individually, still basically on the defensive ...'' the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> quotes the history as saying. It quotes the history as detailing a media campaign against <PERSON> Gerhard </PERSON> <PERSON> Alois </PERSON> <PERSON> Westrick </PERSON>, allegedly a German agent in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> with close ties to <PERSON> Torkild </PERSON> <PERSON> Rieber </PERSON>, the president of <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION>. A `` first class news story'' was `` written by BSC and placed through an intermediary in the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION> ...'' under headlines such as `` Hitler Agent Ensconced in <LOCATION> Westchester </LOCATION>,'' the history said. `` <PERSON> Westrick </PERSON> was deluged with threatening telephone calls,'' it said. `` A hostile crowd gathered outside his house.'' His American contacts deserted him, according to the document.

 <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> is trying to head off government fines for lax security measures found after last year's bombing of a jet over <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>, according to a report Sunday Pan Am Chairman <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Plaskett </PERSON> went to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> last week to argue to federal officials that results of a special government investigation, which found security flaws, do not warrant penalties, <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> reported. The security flaws are not believed to be tied to the bombing of Flight 103 but did involve violations of rules about screening passengers and baggage, the newspaper said. The flight originated in <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> and made a stop in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>; it was headed for <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Investigators say a bomb disguised in a radio-cassette player was put aboard the plane in a suitcase at <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION>. The plane exploded over <LOCATION> Lockerbie </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>, on Dec. 21, killing all 259 people aboard and 11 others on the ground. ABC News reported in January that baggage handlers and others at <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Heathrow </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> were not passing background checks, and that one <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> security guard in <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> said he had received only minimal training before going to work for the company. A routine investigation in October 1988 found <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> security at <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> generally acceptable, the Times reported. But in the weeks after the explosion, the special investigation by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> found several violations. The newspaper quoted unidentified aviation officials as saying that any flaws found in that special inquiry were corrected months ago.

<TEXT>
 A London-based movement for free speech said Friday that three <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> soldiers were punished for brutality, but the Estonian journalist who helped expose the case was drafted into the army in retaliation. The Index on Censorship organization appealed to supporters to write to Soviet Defense Minister <PERSON> Dmitri </PERSON> <PERSON> Yazov </PERSON> and protest. It said Noorte Haal -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Voice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Youth </ORGANIZATION> -RRB-, journal of the <ORGANIZATION> Komsomol </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Youth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION>, published an article on March 21 `` about the appalling experiences in the Soviet army'' of `` <PERSON> Mati </PERSON>,'' a young Estonian conscript. It said `` brutality, degradation and corruption were starkly revealed as well as the fact that <PERSON> Mati </PERSON> had traveled to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> to describe his case and apply for a transfer.'' It said authorities agreed to transfer him, but on Sept. 13 the journalist, <PERSON> Madis </PERSON> <PERSON> Jurgen </PERSON>, was ordered to report for an army medical examination in six days. <PERSON> Jurgen </PERSON>'s report led to a trial that ended on Aug. 4 with one soldier's being sentenced to four years in a labor camp and two others to three years in a disciplinary battalion, it said. Index on Censorship said a company commander was forced to retire and his political aide was reprimanded and transferred. `` The journalist, <PERSON> Madis </PERSON> <PERSON> Jurgen </PERSON>, will nevertheless be drafted for exposing an illegality which led to the trial and conviction of at least some of the guilty,'' it said. Index on Censorship did not identify the unit or give other details about <PERSON> Mati </PERSON>, who came from <LOCATION> Tallinn </LOCATION>, capital of <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION>, or <PERSON> Jurgen </PERSON>. The glasnost-era Soviet press has exposed widespread hazing of recruits, poor living conditions in the barracks and other woes in the Soviet armed forces, which once were above public reproach.

<HEAD>Senate Advancing Disaster Payment Compromise</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Farm-state senators said Friday they hoped the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> would act quickly on a committee proposal that could mean larger disaster payments to winter wheat and cotton farmers who started a second crop after weather destroyed their first. Legislation approved by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Thursday night would change the way disaster assistance payments are calculated. Lawmakers have complained that an <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> formula will penalize those producers, and in some instances mean farmers could receive no disaster payments even though they earned little or no profit on their second crops. The proposal is part of a broad budget-balancing package the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> is expected to consider soon, but some farm-state members hope the disaster relief measure can be acted on separately. The problem stems from a nearly $ 900 million disaster relief package enacted last month. In an effort to prevent farmers from reaping double benefits, it required the department to reduce assistance payments to farmers by the value of any crop that replaced one ruined by bad weather. The legislation did not spell out how to determine the replacement crop value. The department decided to deduct 75 percent of the gross value of the replacement crop from the disaster payment a farmer would have otherwise received for losses on his first crop. The formula is supposed to account for production costs of the replacement crop, in effect coming up with a net value figure. However, lawmakers contended the does not account for regional differences in production costs. Under the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> proposal, farmers would have no payment reductions if their replacement crops failed to produce more than 40 percent of the average yield in their county. Those farmers harvesting more than that would undergo the 75 percent deduction only on the value of their replacement crops above the 40 percent yield threshold. Other provisions would require quick payment for acres not replanted, for which farmers would have to apply before Oct. 1.

<TEXT>
 The government and <ORGANIZATION> Mobil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> signed a contract Friday opening for exploration much of <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Upper </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Huallaga </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>, a region largely under leftist rebel control and a focus of President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s anti-drug strategy. The valley, 270 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION>, is the source of most of the world's coca leaf, the raw material for making cocaine. Peruvian police with help from <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> drug agents are conducting raids there to destroy labs operated by drug traffickers allied with the Maoist Shining Path guerrillas. President <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> said the presence of <ORGANIZATION> Mobil </ORGANIZATION> in the <LOCATION> Huallaga </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> is a `` long-term way to combat subversion and to combat the cultivation of coca.'' Government officials and company representitives did not comment on what security measures would be taken to protect <ORGANIZATION> Mobil </ORGANIZATION> workers. The agreement calls for an initial investment of $ 107.5 million in the valley over the contract's six-year exploration phase and the drilling of at least one exploratory well a year. More than 14,000 square miles of the valley will be open for exploration. The company is required to begin exploration work within 180 days. <ORGANIZATION> Mobil </ORGANIZATION> predicts a possible investment of $ 1.5 to $ 2 billion over the 30-year extraction phase of the contract should exploration prove fruitful. <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Nunez </PERSON>, president of the state-owned petroleum company <ORGANIZATION> PetroPeru </ORGANIZATION>, which represents the government in the contract, said the area could contain as much as 1 billion barrels of oil. The government estimates <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>'s current oil reserves at about 440 million barrels. <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION> produces about 140,000 barrels a day, of which about 120,000 barrels are used domestically.

Still unresolved after a week of meetings at The <ORGANIZATION> Carter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> are who would serve as co-chairmen for the peace talks, who would be allowed as observers and what would be the duties of the meeting's staff, <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> said The talks would be held at one or more of these African nations: <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Yemen </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tanzania </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Zimbabwe </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> said no date for the peace talks has been set.

<TEXT>
 A judge agreed Friday to block the state's bid to close `` Tent City,'' the makeshift outdoor county prison camp where 100 inmates have spent the last month, officials said State corrections officials wanted Saturday to be the last day for the <LOCATION> Secaucus </LOCATION> camp, opened as a court-ordered measure to relieve severe overcrowding in the <LOCATION> Hudson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> jail. But the prisoners will stay at least another week under an order by Judge <PERSON> Burrell </PERSON> <PERSON> Ives </PERSON> <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON> in <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Hudson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>. `` There is no way tent city is closing tomorrow,'' said <PERSON> Cas </PERSON> <PERSON> Rakowski </PERSON>, a spokesman for the county jail. `` It would be a near impossibility to take those 100 state prisoners.'' <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON> said the state can not close the tent city without his approval and without giving at least seven days notice, <PERSON> Rakowski </PERSON> said. The state argued that it had satisfied the original court order that forced the quick assemblage of tents and barbed wire on a site in the <LOCATION> Hackensack </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Meadowlands </LOCATION>. State lawyers said the temporary order covered a 30-day period ending Saturday, while county representatives said it was in force long enough for them to complete the new jail, which is scheduled to open Oct. 9. County officials say they can not find room for the minimum-security, <ORGANIZATION> Tent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> inmates until they complete the prefabricated, 336-bed jail at <LOCATION> Kearny </LOCATION>. The inmates are convicted of crimes that would have them in state prisons if not for a backlog that has forced an overflow of state-sentenced prisoners at the county jails. While the tent jail has been popular with inmates and has largely been judged a success, <ORGANIZATION> Corrections </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Stabile </PERSON> said it would be unwise to start relying on such stopgap measures in the future. `` This is a temporary measure,'' he said. `` Cold weather is coming. It's worked with minimum security inmates, -LRB- but -RRB- it's not something we wanted to do. It's something we had to do.'' The inmates have praised the prison camp, saying its spaciousness and fresh air are superior to the cramped quarters of the overcrowded, 63-year-old <LOCATION> Hudson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jail </LOCATION>, which has a population near 900. `` Prisoners love it out there,'' <PERSON> Rakowski </PERSON> said. `` They have more freedom, more recreation. ...

<TEXT>
 Federal regulators acting on behalf of a seized <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> thrift filed a $ 1.1 billion fraud and racketeering lawsuit Friday against the founder of the thrift's parent company and other individuals. The civil lawsuit, filed by <ORGANIZATION> Resolution </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> under the federal racketeering statute, was the government's largest filing against a thrift. It also alleges negligence, breach of fiduciary duty and breach of contract. The alleged wrongdoing involves <ORGANIZATION> Lincoln </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION>, a wholly owned subsidiary of <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION>. Defendants named by the lawsuit included company founder <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Keating </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, his wife, and various <PERSON> Keating </PERSON> relatives and company executives. The lawsuit charges fraud in the takeover of <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> and subsequent mismanagement that squandered the thrift's assets, diverted `` enormous'' sums to the parent company and benefited <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> and its executives at <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON>'s expense. American <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> was not named in the complaint because it filed for reorganization under Chapter 11 of federal bankruptcy laws in April and received an automatic stay. The $ 1.1 billion sought in damages surpasses a $ 500 million claim against <ORGANIZATION> Sunbelt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> and Loan. Federal racketeering laws allow the government to seek triple damages from defendants. Federal regulators seized <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> on April 14, the day after <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> filed for protection from creditors. American <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> attorney <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Melvin </PERSON> <PERSON> McDonald </PERSON> said: `` We will vigorously defend the case and we fully believe that once all the information comes out we believe that all of the individuals named will be vindicated.'' The lawsuit contends that beginning in 1983, <PERSON> Keating </PERSON> and four other <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> officers schemed to divert funds from the thrift for their own use. The five are accused of racketeering. The lawsuit names a total of 20 individuals and 17 business enterprises. `` The implementation of this scheme involved concealing from the regulatory authorities, first, the true intentions for acquiring -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Lincoln </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- and, next, the actual operation of the thrift,'' the suit states. The lawsuit states that prior to 1984 the defendants operated an <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> enterprise comprised of about 17 corporations primarily focused on speculative real estate transactions. It alleges that around 1983, <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION>'s enterprises needed additional funds to expand its real estate transactions. The lawsuit claims that <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> acquired <ORGANIZATION> Lincoln </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> by making `` material misprepresentations'' to the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, the former agency regulating the nation's savings and loans It also alleges that once <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> <PERSON> Savings </PERSON> became a subsidiary, money was diverted to the parent; insider loans, bad loans and bad investmests were made; and transactions were manipulated to enhance the American <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> and its insiders. A recurring element in the transactions, the lawsuit claims, was that <ORGANIZATION> Lincoln </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> turned over cash for <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> allegedly to pay the thrift's income taxes, even though no taxes were currently due. <PERSON> Keating </PERSON> and his advisors also face a dozen class-action suits filed by about 23,000 bondholders. American <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> has responded by suing the <ORGANIZATION> FHLBB </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deposit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> to remove <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> from federal conservatorship.

 Bad-show fans will find much to like when `` Alien Nation'' bows tonight with a two-hour premiere that marks <ORGANIZATION> Fox </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION>'s expansion to Monday night jousts with <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>. Only the first hour of `` Alien Nation'' was available for review. But I will count my blessings, even though I'm no good at fractions. This hour is n't very apt in writing and direction, and odds are the second is equally to the left of whoopee. Based on the movie of the same name, the new `` Nation'' series combines cops and family life and _ here's the hook _ highly intelligent, human-like refugees from another galaxy who now find themselves in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. The show stars <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Graham </PERSON>, a fine young actor, as <PERSON> Matt </PERSON> <PERSON> Sikes </PERSON>, a streetwise cop -LRB- when will TV get a streetdumb cop? -RRB- whose black partner was killed by an outer-space alien during a holdup. <PERSON> Matt </PERSON> is bitter at `` slags,'' as he and other racist _ or maybe it's alienist _ humans call the refugees. No matter that most of the refugees just want to join the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> mainstream and be decent, hard-working citizens. Problem is, the Newcomers tend to stand out. They have strange heads that resemble coneheads blown backwards and given a rash. But of course our angry plainclothes cop is assigned a new partner, an alien named <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Francisco </PERSON>, -LRB- <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Pierpoint </PERSON> -RRB-. And of course <PERSON> Matt </PERSON> is not at all happy at this, even though the new guy is decent, hard-working, and offers him bran muffins and prune juice when he comes to work. But if you do n't think <PERSON> Matt </PERSON> will come to respect <PERSON> George </PERSON> and other decent aliens, you probably do n't believe in the tooth fairy. The new partner is solidly middle-class and has a family _ a brilliant wife, a lovable daughter and a rebellious teen-age son who represents wayward alien youth and hates earthlings, particularly cops. The son is sort of a skinhead who hangs out with similar alien teens and only wants to speak in his native tongue. His native tongue is not Mork's cheery `` Nano-Nano.'' It sounds more like a TV producer discussing a TV critic. But at least you get English subtitles. In time, <PERSON> Matt </PERSON> even has dinner with <PERSON> George </PERSON>'s family at <PERSON> George </PERSON>'s home Save for the son, the family is warm and gracious. <PERSON> Matt </PERSON> does n't even have to eat raw beaver as they do -LRB- their bodies ca n't tolerate cooked food, you see -RRB- This gradual coming-together is part of the show's underlying theme of tolerance and acceptance of living things, regardless of race, creed or galaxy. The stage for all this is set at an ugly early scene of alien hatred. A small mob of humans, one with a sign that says `` America For Humans,'' gathers at the little alien girl's school, demanding that the slags get out of their neighborhood. <PERSON> Matt </PERSON>, the supposed slag-hater, fires his gun in the air, then shames them all away. Good <PERSON> Matt </PERSON>. Among other digressions, the opening hour has a mysterious case for the new partners to solve. It concerns a dead wino covered with rashes and slime whose corpse has been spirited away for some mysterious alien surgery. There also a potential love sub-plot for <PERSON> Matt </PERSON> that involves his beautiful alien neighbor -LRB- <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Treas </PERSON> -RRB-, a biochemist. One can only wonder what kind of amour scenes this will lead to in later episodes. For as we learn in a bedroom scene with <PERSON> George </PERSON> and his wife -LRB- <PERSON> Michele </PERSON> <PERSON> Scarabelli </PERSON> -RRB-, the alien method of foreplay is ... humming. Tuesday night marks the premiere of a more humdrum CBS series set in <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>, `` Island Son.'' It stars <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Chamberlain </PERSON>, the compassionate, idealistic Dr. <PERSON> Kildare </PERSON> before he became a miniseries idol. Well, he is back as a compassionate, idealistic doctor, one named Dr. <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Kulani </PERSON>, sort of a Hawaiian Kildare. The chief difference, other than the new setting in a <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION> hospital, is that this doc has a lady friend who plays cello. The debut show opens with a car crash caused by a drunk driver and witnessed by <PERSON> Kulani </PERSON> and his sweetie -LRB- <PERSON> Leslie </PERSON> <PERSON> Bevis </PERSON> -RRB-. The crash leaves a young girl brain-dead, and the plot centers on the anguish of the doctor and the child's mother over a heart transplant that could save another child. Medical, moral and legal issues are raised and resolved, all predictably. True, <PERSON> Chamberlain </PERSON> often emits lines that bad-dialogue collectors will treasure forever. But that may not prove sufficient to keep this medicine show from soon being told to pack its satchel, leave <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>, and move to the tiny TV island of Cancel-Cancel.

<HEAD>The NAIC Pleas For A Capital Gains Tax Cut</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 If a proposed capital gains tax cut would benefit mainly the very rich, as critics claim, then its benefits must be broadened if it is to receive popular support. That's not the only major problem facing the proposal, which last week won approval from the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Means </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> is considering a different approach. Somehow, a compromise must be reached. With these and other considerations in mind, <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Hara </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, whose membership includes 6,832 investment clubs, decided to write President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and Rep. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Rostenkowski </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ill </LOCATION>. His proposals: _ Permit the first $ 25,000 of an individual's capital gains each year to be _ Grant a lifetime exemption of $ 500,000 in capital gains from stocks to an individual This would be in line with the precedent set for profits on home sales. _ Allow an individual to roll-over capital gains from securities into new investments without tax on capital gains until retirement age is reached And then tax only half those gains. _ Index capital gains to inflation These ideas might help, said <PERSON> O'Hara </PERSON>, because compromise must be reached not just in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, but between the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Rostenkowski </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> feels a cut would encourage long-term investing. <PERSON> Rostenkowski </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Ways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Means </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> chairman, thinks that over time it would deprive Uncle <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> of funds. The platform from which <PERSON> O'Hara </PERSON>'s proposals are made is an interesting one. Most <ORGANIZATION> NAIC </ORGANIZATION> clubs began with little money. In August, these clubs averaged 16.2 members and $ 65,000 in assets, to which they added $ 452.77 per club in contributions. As a group, therefore, they might have a small-investor view. But they also have some big-investor credentials. Some clubs have been very successful, helping members to buy houses and pay tuitions. As individuals, apart from their club membership, some members have portfolios that run into the millions of dollars. The association's viewpoint is further broadened by inclusion of 48,000 individual members in a low-cost investment program, in which investors buy their first share in a company through <ORGANIZATION> NAIC </ORGANIZATION>, and thereafter buy directly from that company on a monthly or quarterly basis. Average investment: $ 75 a shot. From <ORGANIZATION> NAIC </ORGANIZATION> headquarters in <LOCATION> Royal </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Oak </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>, <PERSON> O'Hara </PERSON> said, `` We asked our members why they were not as active as individual investors as they had been in the past.'' The common response, he says, was that members were discouraged by the change <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> made in 1986 by taxing capital gains, plus they felt there was a lack of consistency in taxing policy. That struck at the <ORGANIZATION> NAIC </ORGANIZATION>'s foundation; it was created to attract ordinary folks into becoming investors, to get them to save and win rather than spend and lose, yet its own members showed a growing reluctance to invest. In short, though interested in stocks, members were becoming like the rest of the public. Thirty years ago the individual investor accounted for 80 percent of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> trading. Now it's less than 20 percent. This situation, he feels, greatly reduces liquidity in the securities markets, reduces capital needed for smaller businesses and deprives individuals of the advantages that come with economic participation. Moreover, he says, <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> faces growing international competition. The cost of raising capital is much lower in many nations with which we compete, one reason being that some have no capital gains tax at all. `` It is clear to us that the less we have in the way of a capital gains tax, the lower the cost of capital will be in this country and the more competitive our industry will be,'' <PERSON> O'Hara </PERSON> wrote. He added a personal observation. `` I am 74 years old and have spent most of my life working with individual investors, encouraging them to save more and invest more. `` I write with the strongest personal conviction that there are only two things that can turn our nation of consumers into a nation of investors.'' One, he said, is a meaningful reduction in capital gains taxation. The other: Depression. The latter, he said, would be an incredibly painful lesson. The first, he wrote, `` will work beyond our greatest expectations.''

<HEAD>Texas Air, UAL Tales Illustrate Two Schools of Airline Management</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICK GLADSTONE</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
 Like two jumbo jets thundering down opposite runways, the bosses of <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> have taken strikingly different approaches to survival _ one fighting its workers, the other offering to make them owners. The contentious, defiant strategy invoked by <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> chairman <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> was on display this past week as the company staged its long-delayed shareholders meeting in a <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> hotel with union pickets chanting anti-Lorenzo slogans outside. Meanwhile, in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, a labor-management coalition pressed its bid to buy <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> with the company's blessing, proving there is no standard operating procedure for running an airline. <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> has carried an anti-union stigma for the past several years, starting with a confrontation at <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> subsidiary <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, which he took into bankruptcy court to nullify union contracts and lower costs. Now out of bankruptcy court, <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> flies with mostly non-union help and often leads the way in lowering ticket prices because the airline is cheaper to operate than many of its competitors. Although <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> denies he opposes organized labor, his image as a union-basher grew over much of the past year, largely because of a strike at <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION>'s other airline, <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>, which he also has hauled into bankruptcy court. In the Eastern case, <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> has hired non-unionists and picket-line crossers to replace the strikers. He has plans to make the airline a low-cost, smaller, more efficient operation regardless of what happens in the strike. <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> reiterated those plans at the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Air annual meeting, where questions abounded about his own future as well as those of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION>, which have enormous debts. He denied speculation he might sell what's left of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> and walk away from a business in which he has played a major role for more than a decade. On the contrary, <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> predicted <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> would start making money next year. A different drama was unfolding at <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION>, one of the nation's most profitable airlines. Unlike <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> has long been seen as an attractive takeover target because it has low debt, lots of airplanes that can be used as collateral, and a highly prized route network into fast-growing <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> that could defray the impact of a domestic economic slowdown on the airline business. Perhaps more important, a change of <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> management in 1988 has gained the confidence of pilots, who struck four years ago in a bitter dispute over pay. That confidence has translated into their joint $ 6.75 billion bid with management to buy <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION>, an offer that makes important labor concessions including pay cuts and a no-strike clause. As of late last week their bid seemed to have a good chance of succeeding, although <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> investor <PERSON> Marvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> offered to match the bid without demanding concessions from the unions. If the labor bid succeeds, <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> would become the largest employee-owned company in the country, and could displace <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> as the low-cost trendsetter. In other business and economic news this past week: _ Junk-bond repayment problems by Canadian property company <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> jolted the market and incited widespread anxiety about the financial health of other companies that have sold the high-risk debt securities Some junk bonds tumbled in value and their yields rose to 30 percent. _ The government dumped a load of economic statistics on the financial markets that suggested the economy is slowing and inflation remains subdued, but the information did little to encourage the purchase of stocks and bonds The <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said wholesale prices dropped in August for the third straight month, and the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said the July trade deficit hit a five-year low of $ 7.58 billion. It also said retail sales rose in August, but that was mainly due to a surge in auto buying that's not expected to last. _ <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, the Wall Street investment bank that pioneered the use of junk bonds for takeovers and corporate growth, formally pleaded guilty to six felonies and fines, penalties and other costs exceeding $ 650 million The plea closed a chapter in an insider trading scandal that began with the arrest of speculator <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON> <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON> nearly three years ago.

<BYLINE>After Hot Summer For Stocks, An Autumn Chill? ^By CHET CURRIER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 After the stock market's long summer rally, many analysts and money managers fear it is heading for an autumn fall. The fears started to rise even before the debt problems of <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> roiled the market for high-yield `` junk'' bonds in the past few days. They intensified when the news about <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> raised the question of whether stocks might catch a chill should takeover fever die down. But a vocal group of optimists persists in predicting new highs for the market above the peaks reached at the beginning of this month. Junk bond worries, they say, may prove nothing more than a convenient excuse for stocks to undergo a `` correction'' that sets the stage for a renewed advance. `` Memories of past Octobers have stirred up fears in almost every analyst we have heard in the past several weeks,'' said <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Leeb </PERSON> in his investment advisory letter Indicator Digest. `` While admittedly few are predicting a crash, many if not most feel that a correction of 10 percent or more is likely by the end of October. Yet not one of these pundits is predicting a concomitant rise in interest rates or big uptick in economic activity. `` This is akin to predicting that a rocket ship will blast off without any fuel in it. It just does n't work that way.'' For a significant decline in stock prices to occur, <PERSON> Leeb </PERSON> argues, `` you must have _ at a minimum _ a sharp rise in interest rates. And that is simply not in the cards.'' Many people who make the decisions at investing institutions such as pension funds came back from the Labor Day holiday in a wary mood, seeking ways to preserve the gains they racked up over the first eight months of the year. The most obvious way to do this is to `` raise cash,'' in Wall Street parlance, by selling some stocks and putting the proceeds in short-term money market investments. But <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Connolly </PERSON> at <ORGANIZATION> Dean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Witter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reynolds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> argues that the supposed safety in such a strategy could be illusory in a business where money managers are measured against their counterparts' performance and the market indexes `` The problem with trying to duck a correction today is that there appears to be very decent potential left on the table,'' he maintains. `` A decent bond outlook, a stable dollar and an economy without excesses is hardly the environment that makes stocks particularly dangerous. `` A correction may occur, given the sharp summer advance, but we view it as essentially unplayable. The fundamentals are too solid and the potential too high to try to sit on a lead.'' Wariness prevailed over enthusiasm in the past week, however, as stocks recorded their second straight loss after nine consecutive weeks of gains. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dropped 34.96 to 2,674.58 on top of a 42.55-point loss the week before. The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> composite index fell 2.36 to 191.59; the <ORGANIZATION> NASDAQ </ORGANIZATION> composite index for the over-the-counter market lost 3.74 to 467.57, and the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> market value index was down 4.46 at 379.64. <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> volume averaged 165.52 million shares a day, against 155.31 million in the previous week. Emphatically not among the bulls on the stock market outlook is <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Grant </PERSON>, editor of the advisory service <PERSON> Grant </PERSON>'s Interest Rate Observer, who says: `` Stocks in general are strong. Yet junk bonds are markedly weak. How to explain the divergence? `` As always, the correct and certain answer is unknowable. However, we happen to have a hypothesis in the form of a prejudice, or guess: The stock market is kidding itself and is riding for a fall.''

Previously, <ORGANIZATION> NL </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> said it would seek written consents from shareholders to oust the board after it rejected an offer to acquire the Atlanta-based company or help it recapitalize, which would give shareholders at least $ 55 per share in cash.

<HEAD>Treasury Secretary: Junk Bond Shakeup Won't Affect Stocks</HEAD>

 Treasury Secretary <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> says investors should n't be worried about price drops in the junk bond market spreading to the stock market. `` I do n't think that's going to happen,'' <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> told a luncheon marking the 50th anniversary of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dealers </ORGANIZATION> on Friday. <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> also defended the proposed cut in capital gains taxes but said he favored a reduction longer the 27 months contained in a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> bill that passed through committee this week. The market in high-yield, high-risk bonds has been in tailspin since Wednesday, when retailing giant <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> said it might not be able to make a major loan payment for one of its affiliates to avoid defaulting on its junk bond debt. Since then, panicky investors have dumped issues they deemed especially risky. But <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> said junk bonds `` have a substantial assets base. This is n't just equity in disguise. There literally are assets behind it.'' `` So I do n't think it'll have an effect on the stock market,'' he added. After a brief speech, <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> answered several questions at the luncheon for <ORGANIZATION> NASD </ORGANIZATION>, the self-regulatory group that oversees the over-the-counter market of securities that are n't traded on nation's major stock exchanges He defended the proposed cut in capital gains _ profits from the sale of capital assets such as stocks or real estate _ approved by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Means </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday. The plan still must clear the full <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> as well as the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. The plan approved by the committee would reduce the tax rate of 33 percent to 19.6 percent for the next 27 months. The tax rate then would rise to 28 percent but would be `` indexed'' to tax only increases exceeding the annual inflation rate. <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> said he wished the terms of the proposed tax were longer, `` but let's take what we can get and keep working on it,'' he said. Critics have called it a tax break for the rich, while supporters say it would help the economy by encouraging investment. `` People are beginning to understand that this not only benefits people who are in our industry, purchasing and selling securities,'' <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> told the crowd of about 300 stock and bond dealers, industry regulators and reporters. `` It benefits the guy who who starts a steel distribution business, with his $ 10,000 savings, in his garage and 38 years later sells it to somebody else for 750,000 bucks,'' he said. `` They're starting to understand that this is n't some sort of Wall Street benefit plan.
