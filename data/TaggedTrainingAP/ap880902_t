 Firefighters declared a temporary victory Friday in their battle to keep a forest fire out of a small <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> town, and forest officials warned that more lightning and dry, hot weather were forecast this weekend. `` It's like sitting on a time bomb,'' said <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON>, recreation officer for the <ORGANIZATION> Sawtooth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Recreation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Area </ORGANIZATION> in central <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>. `` If we can get through this weekend without a conflagration, it will be a miracle.'' Forests and rangeland burned Friday in parts of <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>, especially in <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION>, and in <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Boise </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Interagency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, the logistics command for the national battle against forest fires, reported more than 25,000 firefighters, military and support personnel on the lines of more than three dozen major fires in the West. Fire Center spokesman <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON> <PERSON> Hartigan </PERSON> called it `` the most severe fire season in almost 30 years.'' More than 3.5 million acres have burned, two-thirds of that in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, and suppression costs already exceed $ 250 million. `` The fire season is anything but over. ... The 30-day weather forecast calls for continued unseasonably hot and dry weather for the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Northwest </LOCATION> and northern Rockies,'' <PERSON> Hartigan </PERSON> said. Record highs were forecast during the weekend in <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, with a threat of lightning. <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> officials asked people to stay out of forests in central <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> and restrictions on such things as open campfires were tightened in <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. Many forests in <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> were closed to recreational use. Logging activity was shut down statewide in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, on public and private land, because of fire concern. The <ORGANIZATION> Weyerhaeuser </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> closed all its timberlands to public access until further notice. The focus of attention Friday in and around <LOCATION> Yellowstone </LOCATION>, where some 550,000 acres have been charred, was the small town of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Yellowstone </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mont. </LOCATION>, just outside the park's west entrance. It was threatened by flames just over a mile away that were spreading from the 118,000-acre North Fork fire inside the park that had grown by nearly 10,000 acres since Thursday morning. Bulldozers, helicopters and back fires stalled the advance of the fire Friday. But gusty winds swept a swath of flame south of the town and a wind change predicted for Monday raised concerns the blaze could move back toward the community. `` In my judgment this community is very defensible,'' <PERSON> Denny </PERSON> <PERSON> Bungartz </PERSON>, the North Fork fire's incident commander, told about 60 townspeople. He said firetrucks had pumped 5,000 gallons of water into dry brush around a warehouse at the park boundary, and 50 fire engines would be in town during the night to hose down buildings if necessary. To the east and north of town, the <LOCATION> Madison </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> formed a natural fire break. Firefighters improved on that barrier by bulldozing fire lines and lighting backfires, exhausting the forest's fuel before the main fire could reach the river, as helicopters dropped water on the area. Residents of the small town, with a year-round population of 750, prepared to evacuate but most stayed put Friday. Most of the people leaving town were tourists who decided to spend their Labor Day weekend somewhere less smoky. Curious onlookers filled the streets Friday as afternoon winds blew away the smoky haze. `` I'm packed up and ready to go,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Powell </PERSON>, owner of a hamburger stand downtown. `` I left <LOCATION> L.A </LOCATION> because I could n't stand the smog. I do n't like this stuff.'' Some people were driving in the other direction, because West Yellowstone will play host to hundreds of square dancers this weekend for the Knothead Jamboree. Resident dance caller <PERSON> Orvile </PERSON> <PERSON> Pittam </PERSON> says it's been sponsored by square dance groups in <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> every Labor Day weekend for 37 years and attracts up to 800 people. <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Takata </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> president, said that while there have been some cancellations because of the fires, it's too early to tell what the overall effect will be. `` We want people to know that right now conditions are pretty good,'' he said Friday. `` We've had some bad press that <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Yellowstone </LOCATION> is being evacuated, and that's just not the case. We hope it will be business as usual.'' Elsewhere in <LOCATION> Yellowstone </LOCATION>, the Clover Mist fire had covered 232,400 acres after growing 1,000 acres in 24 hours, the <LOCATION> Snake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> complex of fires was stable at about 156,500 acres and the <LOCATION> Wolf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> fire grew slightly to 40,500 acres, said fire information officer <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Morris </PERSON>. North of <LOCATION> Yellowstone </LOCATION> in south-central <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>, firefighters in the Absaroka-Beartooth Wilderness changed their tactics Friday on a 49,800-acre wilderness fire that jumped fire lines four days in a row. Fire information officer <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Comstock </PERSON> said Friday that officals changed their strategy from building fire lines to setting backfires because `` our method of approach right now has n't been effective in catching this fire.'' Fire bosses in <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> used a second day of light wind to gain more ground against the worst of <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>'s 17 wildfires, with more than 3,000 firefighter and support personnel still battling fires that had burned more than 75,000 acres. Only the 40,300-acre Tepee Butte fire remained out of control in <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>, in the <ORGANIZATION> Wallowa-Whitman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> and the Hell's <ORGANIZATION> Canyon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Recreation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Area </ORGANIZATION> It was 25 percent contained Friday, officials said. By Friday, fires that raged through tinder-dry <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> forests were dying down, with all reported contained or under control. A new forest fire near <LOCATION> Salt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> forced the evacuation of a few homes on Friday. The state's largest fire was a 2,000-acre blaze fanned by ridgetop winds near northern <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>'s Pineview Reservoir. The fire was initially declared under control late Tuesday at 525 acres but roared to life again late Wednesday when gusts fanned hot spots and pushed flames over fire lines.

 The federal government has agreed to pay $ 560,000 to settle its dispute with a senior employee who was fired five years ago after warning of hazardous conditions in major government buildings, his attorney said late Friday. The <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> agreed to the payment to settle its dispute with <PERSON> Bertrand </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Berube </PERSON>, with the bulk of the money representing back pay and interest, said <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON>, an attorney for <PERSON> Berube </PERSON> and director of the Government Accountability Project. The <ORGANIZATION> GSA </ORGANIZATION> in July had been ordered by the <ORGANIZATION> Merit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> to reinstate <PERSON> Berube </PERSON> to his former post as the <ORGANIZATION> GSA </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> area regional director and to pay him back wages and legal fees Under terms of the settlement, <PERSON> Berube </PERSON> will receive $ 530,000, of which $ 181,000 will go for attorney's fees. In addition, the <ORGANIZATION> GSA </ORGANIZATION> will pay $ 24,000 into his retirement account, and $ 6,000 for unemployment compensation <PERSON> Berube </PERSON> otherwise would have to repay, <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Berube </PERSON> also was offered a position as deputy administrator in the <ORGANIZATION> GSA </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> area office, but opted to retire now, at age 55. He will be allowed to begin drawing a full pension of $ 32,500 a year immediately. <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> said was <PERSON> Berube </PERSON> was pleased with the settlement, but would rather have had his job back in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. Someone else has the job now, and <PERSON> Berube </PERSON> opted to settle rather than go through additional years of litigation for <PERSON> Berube </PERSON> to regain the position, <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> GSA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Costello </PERSON> confirmed that the agency has agreed to five the Government Accounting Project, which championed <PERSON> Berube </PERSON>'s case, a check for $ 530,000 to settle the dispute, <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> reported in Saturday's editions. Overall, <PERSON> Berube </PERSON> can be expected to receive $ 440,000 in back pay and benefits over his lifetime that he would not have received without the settlement. At the time of his firing, <PERSON> Berube </PERSON> oversaw 7,000 employees in the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> area and a budget of $ 2 billion. He was in charge of maintaining virtually every government building in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Berube </PERSON> was dismissed after he alleged that many federal buildings in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> posed serious fire and health hazards and that maintenance was deferred to save money.

 Hurricane Debby lashed this Gulf of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> port city Friday with heavy rain and winds gusting up to 74 mph, knocking out power, flooding streets and forcing some people to flee their homes. But the first hurricane of the 1988 <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> season began weakening shortly after hitting the coast and was downgraded to a tropical storm. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> said <PERSON> Debby </PERSON> moved inland at <LOCATION> Tuxpan </LOCATION>, a city of 120,000 about 165 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, at 4 p.m. -LRB- 6 p.m. EDT -RRB-. It said at that time the storm was carrying winds up to 74 mph, the minimum strength to be classified as a hurricane. The service downgraded <PERSON> Debby </PERSON> to tropical-storm status after its center stalled on reaching the eastern <LOCATION> Sierra </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Madre </LOCATION> mountain range 50 miles inland about 7:30 p.m., with maximum winds of 49 mph. Heavy rains were falling in parts of <LOCATION> Veracruz </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Tamaulipas </LOCATION> states. `` We can say the storm is becoming disorganized,'' a weather service spokesman said. `` By morning maximum winds should be around 30 mph and the storm should disappear by Saturday night.'' The storm caused power outages in <LOCATION> Tuxpan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Poza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION>, about 20 miles to the south, and dozens of people were evacuated from low-lying areas in the two cities and near the <LOCATION> Tuxpan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Tecolutla </LOCATION> rivers. `` The rains have calmed somewhat, but the winds are strong,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> worker <PERSON> Francisco </PERSON> <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Cruz </PERSON> <PERSON> Balderas </PERSON>. `` Many streets are inundated, and the rivers are rising fast.'' Hundreds of people sought refuge in schools and municipal offices in <LOCATION> Alamo </LOCATION>, a coffee-producing town about 20 miles west of <LOCATION> Tuxpan </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Roberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON>, editor of the newspaper <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mundo </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Tampico </LOCATION>. Dozens of residents had to be rescued from cars and flooded homes in <LOCATION> Poza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION>, a city of 300,000. Authorities closed streets in some sections of the city because of flooding. `` The situation is bad enough, but not desperate,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Poza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION>. `` A lot of trash in the streets and tree trunks are blocking runoff,'' he said. `` Even we ca n't get out _ we're trapped.'' He said several dozen residents of low-lying areas in the city were evacuated to higher ground but he could n't give a figure as to how many people were affected. <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> said there were power outages throughout the northern <LOCATION> Veracruz </LOCATION> coastline and that some local roads were cut off by flooding. Residents of <LOCATION> Tampico </LOCATION> and other cities in southern <LOCATION> Tamaulipas </LOCATION> state were bracing for heavy rains, he said. `` There was a lot of panic buying in supermarkets here, but so far there have n't been any problems,'' <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Guadalupe </PERSON> <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON>, a spokeswoman with the <LOCATION> Veracruz </LOCATION> state government in <LOCATION> Jalapa </LOCATION>, said she could provide no figures on how many people were affected by the storm and that officials had no estimate of damages. There were no reports of deaths or injuries, she said. Although the national weather services in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> said <PERSON> Debby </PERSON> was carrying winds of 74 mph, the <LOCATION> Mexican </LOCATION> navy station and port authority in <LOCATION> Tuxpan </LOCATION> said it did not have hurricane strength. <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> Capt. <PERSON> Domingo </PERSON> <PERSON> Rojas </PERSON> <PERSON> Cadenas </PERSON> said his reports showed <PERSON> Debby </PERSON> carrying winds of 50 mph and gusts of up to 62 mph when it reached <LOCATION> Tuxpan </LOCATION>. `` There is heavy rain now'' he said late Friday, but the storm had not caused any major problems. <PERSON> Debby </PERSON> grew from a depression into a tropical storm early Friday and then quickly gathered strength, becoming a hurricane by afternoon when it was just off the coast. It was the first hurricane of the 1988 Atlantic hurricane season and the fourth named storm.

 A sculpture garden where visitors touch, climb on and lie down in statues worth millions of dollars attracts those who rarely visit museums. The <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION> Sculpture Garden, being formally dedicated Saturday, is on 7 -LCB- acres of downtown city parkland and is the largest urban sculpture garden in the country, city and museum officials say. It features a giant cherry in a spoon by <PERSON> Claes </PERSON> <PERSON> Oldenburg </PERSON>, and sculptures by other such masters as <PERSON> Isamu </PERSON> <PERSON> Noguchi </PERSON> and <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>. `` I see children playing around and among the sculptures. They become active participants like you probably could n't have in a museum,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Fisher </PERSON>, superintendent of the <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> and Recreation Board. The $ 12.8 million joint project of <ORGANIZATION> Walker </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Art </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, the park board and the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Minnesota </ORGANIZATION>'s Landscape Arboretum provides hands-on experience for adults, too, with its 40 sculptures. Visitors, who have been allowed in during the two years the project has been in development, can swing on a platform suspended from the large, steel-beamed sculpture `` Arikidea'' by <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> di </PERSON> <PERSON> Suvero </PERSON>, watching the beams overhead shift slowly from the motion of the swing. They can lie on their backs in the aluminum human form that faces the sky and become part of <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Shelton </PERSON>'s `` BLACKVAULTfalloffstone. Or they can step inside <PERSON> Meg </PERSON> <PERSON> Webster </PERSON>'s `` Glen,'' a plant-filled earthen crater, and enjoy the scents and colors of perennial plants and wildflowers. `` The interaction has been one of the bigger things that we've pulled off,'' <PERSON> Fisher </PERSON> said `` To watch the pure joy of some people in their interactions has been a real delight to me.'' The sculptures date from early in the century to the present, and range in style from classical realism to elemental abstractism. They were created by artists working in a variety of media, including bronze, stone and wood. Permanent installations represent such acknowledged masters as <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>, <PERSON> Reuben </PERSON> <PERSON> Nakian </PERSON> and <PERSON> Isamu </PERSON> <PERSON> Noguchi </PERSON>, as well as leading contemporaries such as <PERSON> Deborah </PERSON> <PERSON> Butterfield </PERSON>, <PERSON> Ellsworth </PERSON> <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> and <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Segal </PERSON>. The garden, designed by <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Larrabee </PERSON> <PERSON> Barnes </PERSON> in association with landscape architect <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Rotschild </PERSON>, is largely symmetrical. Four 100-foot-square plazas are separated by walkways lined with linden trees. The more traditional sculptures are placed among the trees along the walkways, with the larger constructions inside the plazas. The garden's focal point is the $ 500,000 fountain sculpture `` <LOCATION> Spoonbridge </LOCATION> and Cherry'' by <PERSON> Claes </PERSON> <PERSON> Oldenburg </PERSON> and Coosje <PERSON> van </PERSON> <PERSON> Brugggen </PERSON>. The giant gray aluminum spoon holding a deep red bing cherry with a black stem arches from the reed and iris-lined shore to an island in a free-form pond, giving off a glistening mist and adding a touch of fantasy to the garden. The Sage and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Cowles </PERSON> <PERSON> Conservatory </PERSON> is a series of three connected glass houses that feature permanent and seasonal horticultural displays. One exhibit contains a dozen palm trees that rise nearly 60 feet high looming over <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Gehry </PERSON>'s 22-foot-high sculpture `` Standing Glass Fish'' which rises from a pool of white water lilies. A footbridge designed by artist <PERSON> Siah </PERSON> <PERSON> Armajani </PERSON> spans city traffic to link the garden to <LOCATION> Loring </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> and the downtown area. One of the major goals of the sculpture garden, said <ORGANIZATION> Walker </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Art </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> director <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Friedman </PERSON>, is to develop an appreciative audience by making as much good work available as possible. The garden is meant to attract art lovers as well as people who do n't normally frequent museums. <PERSON> Friedman </PERSON> said he hopes it will help dispell the perception that a museum is `` a somewhat remote presence, even a fortress of art.''

<TEXT>
 The guards at the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION>, on alert for suicide car bombers and other terrorists, were perplexed this week when a pickup truck approached the iron gate with a pink-ribboned camel peering from the rear. They stopped the driver and shouted at him in Arabic: `` It's forbidden It's forbidden!'' After a few minutes of negotiations, the heavy gate swung open and in came <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>'s camel _ an example of southern -LRB- <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> -RRB- hospitality. The saga began the weekend of Aug. 17, when Egyptian officials telephoned wealthy camel trader <PERSON> Abdel-Wahab </PERSON> <PERSON> Waguih </PERSON> and told him the former <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> president and his wife, <PERSON> Rosalynn </PERSON>, would be visiting suburban <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION>'s sprawling camel market. The Carters and seven relatives arrived Aug. 18 for a two-day private visit to cap an African tour. A <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said Mrs. <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> specifically selected the camel market for sightseeing along with the <LOCATION> Giza </LOCATION> pyramids and the Sphinx. At the market, in the suburb of <LOCATION> Imbaba </LOCATION>, traders noisily bargain to sell camels earlier bought from Sudanese owners, who trek with the animals for about 40 days across <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION>'s desert before bringing them by train from southern <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Imbaba </LOCATION>. Once sold, the animals are used as a beasts of burden or are slaughtered for meat. <PERSON> Waguih </PERSON> was instructed to show the <ORGANIZATION> Carters </ORGANIZATION> around and give them a flavor of Egyptian business. But he also gave the <ORGANIZATION> Carters </ORGANIZATION> two silver daggers, a bunch of genuine Sudanese camel whips _ and the 6-year-old camel, a pink ribbon tied around his neck, worth between $ 560 and $ 740. He said his gift-giving was typical of `` Saeedi'' _ the hospitality shown by people from southern <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>. His generosity went so far as wanting to honor his guests by slaughtering a sheep at <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>'s feet, a traditional Moslem act of welcome, `` but the American Embassy people told me not to,'' he said. `` <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> would n't like it.'' Although he accepted the huge animal, <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> told the embassy he could n't take it home to <LOCATION> Plains </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ga. </LOCATION>, and instead wanted to give it to Sister <PERSON> Emmanuelle </PERSON>, a French nun who works with <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION>'s garbage collectors, the zabaleen. Nobody came to pick up the beast for 10 days, and <PERSON> Waguih </PERSON> said he became impatient. `` I took it to the embassy in a van. There were guards at the door, but I do n't care, I'm not afraid,'' he said, recounting the Monday incident at the embassy as he sat outside his office at the market with 10 relatives. An embassy official signed a receipt for the camel and dispatched an Egyptian employee with <PERSON> Wagih </PERSON> to deliver it to al-Muqattam mountain, where thousands of zabaleen live and where Sister <PERSON> Emmanuelle </PERSON> has set up a school, a health center and a veterinary clinic. `` The camel is now out of our hands,'' said the embassy spokesman, speaking on condition of anonymity. `` It's up to Sister <PERSON> Emmanuelle </PERSON> to decide what to do with it, to sell it or have it slaughtered for meat.'' The Roman Catholic nun had no comment except `` I still do n't know'' the camel's fate For the zabaleen, accustomed to donkeys, pigs and sheep, the camel provided a spectacle but not much enthusiasm _ or appetite. `` We are n't used to eating camel meat in this area,'' said <PERSON> Yanni </PERSON> <PERSON> Rizk </PERSON>, a worker at the nearby <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION> slaughterhouse, explaining it is an area without camel butchers. `` It's a joke,'' said Sister <PERSON> Juliana </PERSON>, an Egyptian nun who helps Sister <PERSON> Emmanuelle </PERSON> at her health center. `` They'll probably sell it and put the money into the vet center. Otherwise, the camel requires money for food and care, and we have no place to keep it.'' The beast, meanwhile, stands waiting in the vet center courtyard, the pink ribbon still around its neck.

 The expatriate daughter of a near legendary hero assassinated 40 years ago is helping to unify vast but potentially chaotic anti-government forces in <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Aung </PERSON> <PERSON> San </PERSON>, leader of <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>'s independence struggle, was gunned down at the age of 32 _ before, as many have suggested, the world of workaday politicking he was about to enter could mar his image. Some media reports have compared his daughter, <PERSON> Aung </PERSON> <PERSON> San </PERSON> <PERSON> Suu </PERSON> <PERSON> Kyi </PERSON>, with <LOCATION> Philippine </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> and <PERSON> Benazir </PERSON> <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> _ women from nationally prominent families who led or lead opposition forces. The 43-year-old daughter last week drew crowds of up to 400,000 to hear her call for democracy after 26 years of authoritarian rule. Some diplomats and Burmese analysts believe she will be only a transitional figure, but one who could help unify disparate groups and prevent a plunge into anarchy. <PERSON> Aung </PERSON> <PERSON> San </PERSON>'s daughter was thrust unwittingly into the political arena after coming to <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> from her home in <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> in April to care for her ailing mother. `` She saw all the commotion and turmoil, the rioting and demonstrators getting killed,'' said Burmese emigre spokesman <PERSON> Max </PERSON> <PERSON> McGrath </PERSON> in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. `` She must have been affected emotionally, especially when demonstrators carried pictures of her father at the head of the procession.'' In an interview with a British television network last week, she said she had no plans for a new political party or an immediate blueprint for a future <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION> beyond an interim <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Consultative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> leading to democracy If her program sounded vague, her presence stirred strong emotions. `` It's like if <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Washington </PERSON>'s son had come along in 1830 and said, ` I'd like to be president of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stats </ORGANIZATION>.' It would have a certain ring to it,'' says British <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION> expert <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>. Like <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, whose name <PERSON> Aung </PERSON> <PERSON> San </PERSON> used to invoke, the <LOCATION> Burmese </LOCATION> leader fought for independence from <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. Sealing their vow to liberate <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION> in blood, he and the so-called `` Thirty Comrades'' marched into their homeland during World War II, attacking first the Allies and then the Japanese. Contemporaries recall <PERSON> Aung </PERSON> <PERSON> San </PERSON> as a compelling personality, a sincere, highly principled and simple-living man who could mix easily with colleagues and then lapse into periods of brooding silence. After the war he negotiated successfully with the British government for independence. But months before it was granted, the youthful, handsome <PERSON> Aung </PERSON> <PERSON> San </PERSON> and half a dozen other leaders were killed when assassins of a political opponent burst into a Cabinet meeting with automatic rifles blazing. His death on July 19, 1947, is still commemorated as Martyr's Day. <PERSON> Aung </PERSON> <PERSON> San </PERSON> <PERSON> Suu </PERSON> <PERSON> Kyi </PERSON> was barely 2 years old when her father died. She was educated in <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, where he mother served as ambassador from 1960 to 1967. She obtained a Bachelor of Arts degree from <ORGANIZATION> Oxford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in 1967, worked at the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> headquarters in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and in 1972 married <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Aris </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> Oxford </ORGANIZATION> professor and expert on Tibetan culture and the Himalayan region. Although she accompanied her husband on long research stints to <LOCATION> Bhutan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nepal </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and other <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> countries, acquaintances say she did not pursue a career after marriage. The demonstrations against a quarter century of oppressive rule ended the calm of her private life. Some Burmese also called for the return of her brother, <PERSON> Aung </PERSON> <PERSON> San </PERSON> <PERSON> Oo </PERSON>, a 45-year-old American citizen living in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Despite the rousing welcome for <PERSON> Aung </PERSON> <PERSON> San </PERSON> <PERSON> Suu </PERSON> <PERSON> Kyi </PERSON>, `` I think people are beginning to have some questions about her,'' said a <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> diplomat in <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION>. `` She's really an expatriate with no political experience.'' But in a <ORGANIZATION> BBC </ORGANIZATION> interview she countered this by saying, `` I have never been away. ... In my thoughts, I have never been away from my country and my people. In my heart, also i have never been seperated from them.'' She and her husband, who is with her in <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> along with their two sons, regularly visited <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION> during the Ne Win period. Rather than an emigre opposition figure, she was allowed to return home at the price of keeping an apolitical silence about conditions in her country, <LOCATION> Burmese </LOCATION> emigres say. Some Burmese believe her marriage to a foreigner would not be well accepted by many in the inward-looking nation. It also is unclear whether she has any formal political ambitions, although last week she appeared to be thinking about a future in <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>. `` The Burmese people love my father very much and I think they are ready to support me because I'm my father's daughter,'' she said.

 Days before he was shot to death in January, 16-year-old <PERSON> Rabeh </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahmoud </PERSON> told his family he wanted to give his life for the Palestinian cause, his sister, <PERSON> Sabah </PERSON>, recalls. <PERSON> Mahmoud </PERSON> is one of 53 youths under age 18 who have been kille during the 8-month-old Palestinian uprising in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. They comprise about a fourth of the deaths from Israeli army gunfire. Thousands of other youths have been wounded. TV viewers worldwide have seen the young Palestinian boys in kafiyeh headdresses throwing rocks at troops, then running as soldiers respond with tear gas and bullets. Israeli military officials allege the youths are placed in the front lines of protests to generate world sympathy and portray <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> occupation troops as ruthless soldiers who do not hesitate to shoot children. `` Children are weapons in this war. It is very sinister,'' said Col. <PERSON> Renaan </PERSON> <PERSON> Gissin </PERSON>, the army's deputy spokesman. `` With children up front, they -LRB- Palestinian leaders -RRB- win either way _ whether our soldiers refrain from shooting because of strict orders to avoid hurting children, or if they open fire, the <LOCATION> Palestinians </LOCATION> win the war for the media,'' <PERSON> Gissin </PERSON> said. `` They make sure the picture of the dead child makes it to the papers.'' But the youngsters, encountered in refugee camps throwing rocks at soldiers not much older than themselves, say they are the leaders of the revolt. They have become known as the `` children of the stones'' after a poem by Syrian writer <PERSON> Nizar </PERSON> <PERSON> Qabani </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> has made posters of youngsters holding firebombs. Palestinians call children who are killed `` martyrs,'' not `` victims.'' <PERSON> Sabah </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahmoud </PERSON>, the sister of slain 16-year-old <PERSON> Rabeh </PERSON>, says her father now is worried about about his 13-year-old son, who is often out in the streets with friends. The father cries whenever soldiers pass their house, she said. `` When <PERSON> Rabeh </PERSON> told my father he wanted to die for Palestine, we thought he was joking,'' <PERSON> Sabah </PERSON> said, sitting below a gold-framed portrait of her dead brother, the only picture on the walls of the <LOCATION> Beitin </LOCATION> village farmhouse not far from <LOCATION> Ramallah </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> casualty lists, updated as of Aug. 12, show 202 Palestinians killed by Israeli army gunfire. Of these 53 are 18 or younger, with 18 under 16 years old and six who were below 14. The youngest casualty listed by the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> was a 9-year-old girl, but the army said she was killed by a rock thrown by a Palestinian. The army, whose death figures differ only slightly from <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> ones, does not give breakdowns by age. The <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> count shows three other Arab youths under 18, including a 12-year-old, were shot to death by Jewish settlers. A 14 - and 17-year-old were beaten to death by troops, the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> says An official of an international relief organization, speaking on conditoin of anonymity, estimated at least 8,000 youngster have been wounded by bullets, beatings, tear gas or rubber bullets. Israeli youths are n't directly involved in the protests, but they are among civilians injured by rocks and firebombs hurled at cars. The army lists 312 such casualties but has no breakdown by age. A Jewish girl, 15-year-old <PERSON> Tirza </PERSON> <PERSON> Porat </PERSON>, was shot to death accidentally by an armed escort in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> in April when a group of Jewish hikers clashed with <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> villagers. Police are investigating whether an 8-year-old boy slain August 27 near <LOCATION> Haifa </LOCATION> was killed by Palestinians. One reason Palestinian youngsters are so involved in protests is demographic: Almost 50 percent of the population of the occupied territories is 17 or younger, according to the <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Project </ORGANIZATION> research foundation. These are youngsters raised under the military rule <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> has maintained over the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> since the territories were captured from <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> in 1967. Analysts say the young have become radicalized and are rebelling against <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and the traditional leadership of their elders, which failed to secure an independent state. `` It's a schoolyard revolution,'' said <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Mills </PERSON>, a U.N. Relief Works Agency official in the occupied <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. `` Even before the uprising, by March of 1987, if you were over 14 years old and had n't been arrested by the Israelis, you had n't got your school letter, to put it in American terms.'' Young people 18 to 25 are emerging as the new generation of leaders, and their younger siblings are followers and would-be successors, military sources said. `` Like the Americans of the 1960s who said, ` Do n't trust anyone over 30,' they are saying ` Do n't trust anyone over 25,''' <PERSON> Gissin </PERSON> said. The Israeli army recently introduced plastic bullets in a move it says is intended to cut casualties. The army says its soldiers have orders not to open fire at children, but occupation rules consider those over age 14 accountable for their actions. <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> George </PERSON>, an official of Save The Children, an <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> relief organization, said the army should respect children's status as minors. `` Even if a kid is involved in a confrontation _ throwing a rock for example _ there is no justification for a well-equipped army to use lethal force,'' <PERSON> George </PERSON> said.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> is planning a low-key welcome for the refitted USS Stark when it returns home Saturday, ready for duty almost 16 months after being heavily damaged by <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> missiles. Lt.

 Half the city's taxis and privately owned cars were banned from the <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION> area for a second straight day in an effort to dispel record levels of smog.

<TEXT>
 The parents of a high school student convicted of murdering his classmate have decided not to take part in a movie about the slaying, spurning a $ 35,000 offer that will go to the victim's mother, a newspaper reported. The movie will be dedicated to the memory of <PERSON> Shaun </PERSON> <PERSON> Ouillette </PERSON>, who was a 15-year-old freshman at <ORGANIZATION> Canton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> when he was beaten to death with a baseball bat in 1986, said <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Bogorad </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Dave </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION>, a Hollywood-based production company. <PERSON> Rod </PERSON> <PERSON> Matthews </PERSON>, also 15, was convicted in March of second-degree murder in the slaying of his classmate. `` They -LRB- <PERSON> Matthew </PERSON>'s parents -RRB- have no interest in the movie,'' a family friend, <PERSON> Mel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ginsberg </PERSON>, told The Patriot Ledger of <PERSON> Quincy </PERSON>. `` They're not going to make it.

<HEAD>Judge Reportedly Dismisses Engineer's Suits Against Morton Thiokol</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SALT LAKE CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A federal judge has dismissed two multibillion-dollar lawsuits filed against <PERSON> Morton </PERSON> <PERSON> Thiokol </PERSON> by a former engineer who warned against the disastrous launch of the space shuttle Challenger, a lawyer said Thursday. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Levin </PERSON>, attorney for former rocket engineer <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Boisjoly </PERSON>, told KSL-TV that he learned Thursday afternoon that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Winder </PERSON> had dismissed the $ 3 billion suits with prejudice, meaning they can not be refiled. Court documents were expected to be made public Friday morning. The judge had taken the matter under advisement in February following a hearing on the company's motion to quash the suits. One of <PERSON> Boisjoly </PERSON>'s suits had sought $ 1 billion for the deaths of the seven Challenger crew members on Jan. 28, 1986, and $ 1 million in compensatory damages for his own health and career. <PERSON> Boisjoly </PERSON>, who this year won the Scientific Freedom and Responsibility Award from the American Association for the Advancement of Science, contended <PERSON> Morton </PERSON> <PERSON> Thiokol </PERSON> impugned his professional reputation after he and other engineers testified before a presidential commission investigating the Challenger explosion. The engineers testified that they had warned against launching the shuttle in the unusually cool weather. His other lawsuit, filed under the False Claims Act on behalf of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> taxpayers, sought $ 2.075 billion and alleged that <PERSON> Morton </PERSON> <PERSON> Thiokol </PERSON> knowingly provided the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> with defective solid rocket motors. <ORGANIZATION> Morton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Thiokol </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Rocky </PERSON> <PERSON> Raab </PERSON> said the company had received no official notification of the decision. `` But if, in fact, it does prove to be true, it does vindicate what we've said all along. It repudiates what the claims were about Challenger that he -LRB- <PERSON> Boisjoly </PERSON> -RRB- made,'' he said. `` Most of all, we're just glad to see that it's over with,'' <PERSON> Raab </PERSON> said. Company attorneys had said <PERSON> Boisjoly </PERSON>'s assertion that he was defamed was based on office chatter. `` It is just workplace-related talk that goes on all the time,'' attorney <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON> told the judge during February's hearing. However, <PERSON> Levin </PERSON> accused company officials of having launched a campaign to defame the engineer through pamphlets and interviews, `` not coffee-shop stuff.'' In a May interview, <PERSON> Boisjoly </PERSON> said only after two years of therapy and `` the positive catharsis'' of giving lectures on the disaster was he able to stop blaming himself for the destruction of the shuttle and deaths of the astronauts. <PERSON> Boisjoly </PERSON> and several other <ORGANIZATION> Morton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Thiokol </ORGANIZATION> engineers had argued the night before the launch that temperatures of 53 degrees Fahrenheit or less could result in a failure of a rocket joint seal. But after a second caucus with <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> officials, <PERSON> Boisjoly </PERSON> said, company managers `` perceived pressure from <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> ... there was no other justification for the launch. I felt the pressure, others felt the pressure.'' He took disability leave July 21, 1986, and left the company for good two months later. The <ORGANIZATION> Rogers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> investigating the explosion later blamed the disaster on a leaking joint seal that allowed superhot gases to escape and ignite the shuttle's external fuel tank.

<TEXT>
 The Chiffons and the Orlons were female quartets, organized in 1960 to sing pop songs. The Taffetas are four women organized in 1988 to sing 1950s pop songs at the off-Broadway Cherry Lane Theater. The Taffetas, who pretend to be sisters, remind one most closely of the Lennon Sisters, of <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Welk </PERSON> reknown. Bubbles even stream up behind the Taffetas during their encore. It's an evening for smiling in the theater. In their pastel-colored gowns, with matching microphone cords and shoes, the Taffetas look like they're going to make fun of the'50s. They do n't. They do n't comment on the songs or update arrangements. They're going for nostalgia, in which the audience can look back with gentle, bemused affection. Those who do n't remember the'50s can view it like their parents' antiquated photo album. Those who do can try to recall who originally sang the songs. The Taffetas stress naivete, talking a lot about Mom and their home town of <LOCATION> Muncie </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ind </LOCATION>. They sing like crystalized sugar, only once digging with gusto into a lyric, `` Where the Boys Are.'' That song was sung originally by <PERSON> Connie </PERSON> <PERSON> Francis </PERSON>. The Taffetas also draw extensively from <PERSON> Patti </PERSON> <PERSON> Page </PERSON> and <PERSON> Teresa </PERSON> <PERSON> Brewer </PERSON>. `` Mr. <PERSON> Sandman </PERSON>'' _ that was by the Chordettes. `` Dedicated to the One I Love'' _ the <LOCATION> Shirelles </LOCATION>. They do n't choose only from female soloists and quartets. `` Cry'' was a <PERSON> Johnnie </PERSON> <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> hit and the <ORGANIZATION> Ames </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION> first enlightened the world about `` Rag Mop,'' which the Taffetas take at a stately tempo. The singers are <PERSON> Jody </PERSON> <PERSON> Abrahams </PERSON>, <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> Curlee </PERSON>, <PERSON> Melanie </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> and <PERSON> Tia </PERSON> <PERSON> Speros </PERSON>. Pianist <PERSON> Rick </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>, drummer <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Osrowitz </PERSON> and bassist <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Rubin </PERSON> accompany. The show was conceived by <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> and staged and choreographed by <PERSON> Tina </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON>. Like the mixed quartet in off-Broadway's `` Oil City Symphony,'' the Taffetas take time to talk about their hobbies. They are n't as clever as the `` Oil City'' four and their music is n't nearly as varied. Still, an evening with `` The Taffetas'' is a pleasant way, as they used to say on `` Your Hit Parade,'' to stroll down memory lane.

 President <PERSON> Virgilio </PERSON> <PERSON> Barco </PERSON> offered Thursday to initiate peace talks with leftist guerrillas, who launched their second big attack in a week in northern <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Barco </PERSON> introduced his peace plan on national television.

Guerrillas firing automatic assault rifles, throwing hand grenades and setting fire to houses killed 12 peasants Tuesday night, Gov. <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Gabriel </PERSON> <PERSON> Amin </PERSON> of the state of <LOCATION> Cordoba </LOCATION> said Thursday. The guerrilla attacks appear to be an effort by the rebels to force the government to open peace talks and make concessions. An estimated 30 guerrillas of the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> set fire to a ranch, killed 10 peasants and wounded 15 Tuesday near the town of <LOCATION> Canalete </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Amin </PERSON> said. Canalete is about 320 miles north of the capital of <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION>. The insurgents then attacked the nearby village of <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Tomate </LOCATION>, setting fire to 26 huts and killing two people, the governor said in a broadcast interview with the Colombian radio chain <ORGANIZATION> RCN </ORGANIZATION>. In <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Tomate </LOCATION>, a village of 600 people, the attackers left messages painted on walls declaring, `` Death to the toads and paramilitaries,'' survivors said in interviews with RCN. Guerrillas call army informants toads. Peasants in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> have long claimed that they are caught between the army and the guerrillas. In dozens of interviews with The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, peasants have told of being forced to sell food and other necessities to guerrillas. Often the army hears of this and through threats or torture, soldiers force the peasants to tell of guerrilla movements, the peasants say. The guerrillas then return and kill the peasants, accusing them of being army informants, the peasants have said. The <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> and another guerrilla group known as the <ORGANIZATION> Colombian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> attacked the town of <LOCATION> Saisa </LOCATION> in the state of <LOCATION> Cordoba </LOCATION> on Aug. 23 and killed 12 civilians, 10 soldiers and two policemen, the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> said earlier. Twenty-two soldiers and policemen were taken prisoner, the ministry said.

<HEAD>Computer Glitch Halts Discovery Astronauts' Simulated Flight</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SPACE CENTER, Houston (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A simulated shuttle mission designed to test the Discovery astronauts' trouble-shooting skills was halted just before a mock landing because of a real-life computer crash, <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> officials said. The five astronauts were preparing to end their 56-hour mission Thursday afternoon by simulating a shuttle landing with a flat tire when the computer shutdown cut the rehearsal short. `` I'm sure they'll be looking at it to see why it went down, but nobody here considers it to be a big problem that the simulation ended early,'' said <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Johnson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Hartsfield </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> officials stressed that there was no problem with any kind of computer used in actual flight control. In <LOCATION> Huntsville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ala. </LOCATION>, meanwhile, engineers at <ORGANIZATION> Marshall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Flight </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday's fifth and final test of seals and joints on the space shuttle booster rocket lifted their confidence in parts redesigned after the Challenger disaster. `` Based on all appearances the test was a complete success,'' said <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>, technical assistant to the manager of the solid rocket motor project. The two-minute static test firing, with the booster segment anchored in a $ 25 million test stand, put launch-style pressure on the redesigned joints. The seals are designed to keep internal hot gases inside the twin rockets that help kick shuttles into earth orbit. The failure of a joint in one of Challenger's two boosters was blamed for the January 1986 explosion that killed all seven crew members. Before the computer crash at <ORGANIZATION> Johnson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, officials said, the Discovery crew handled all the simulated problems posed to them during a dress rehearsal for their flight, which is slated for late September or early October. The 56-hour mock mission began about an hour late Tuesday morning because of an earlier problem with the shuttle simulator. But other glitches faced by the Discovery crew were intentional, as commander <PERSON> Rick </PERSON> <PERSON> Hauck </PERSON>, pilot <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Covey </PERSON> and mission specialists <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Hilmers </PERSON>, <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Lounge </PERSON> and <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> were placed in situations designed to test their ability to solve a multitude of problems that could encounter on an actual mission. Shortly after launch Tuesday, the astronauts were forced to alter their course and enter a low orbit after <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> trainers staged a main engine failure. On Wednesday, <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lounge </PERSON> had to go outside the orbiter to fix a stuck tilt-table needed to deploy a $ 100 million communications satellite. That simulation was done in a water tank, spokeswoman <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Selby </PERSON> said.

 Investigators Thursday found the flap indicator handle on a shattered <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 727 in the wrong position, but a federal safety official said it could have been jarred that way in the fiery crash, which killed 13 people. The handle, which is located on the console between the pilot and the first officer, indicates the position of the aircraft's wing flaps At a news conference Thursday night, <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> member <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Dickinson </PERSON> said the handle on the <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lines </ORGANIZATION> jet that crashed Wednesday was found to be in the `` up position,'' opposite where it should have been for a proper takeoff. But he went on to say the handle could have been pushed into the wrong position by the impact or by a crew member during the plane's evacuation <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> Flight 1141 went down as it tried to take off from <LOCATION> Dallas-Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> en route to <LOCATION> Salt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> with more than 100 people aboard. Most were able to escape the burning plane by crawling out of emergency exits or torn-open areas. All 13 deaths were attributed to smoke inhalation, according to the <LOCATION> Tarrant </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> medical examiner's office, with burns also listed in two instances. One of the survivors, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Coester </PERSON>, 39, of the <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> suburb of <LOCATION> Carrollton </LOCATION>, said he was most troubled by his unsuccessful efforts to rescue passengers trapped in the back of the burning plane. `` I tried to get the rear door open,'' said <PERSON> Coester </PERSON>, who was hospitalized for smoke inhalation and first -, second - and third-degree `` There was a handle on the outside. I got the door ajar, but not enough for them to get out.'' Investigators found at least five bodies near that door after the flames were extinguished. The same flight Thursday from <LOCATION> Dallas-Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Salt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> was aborted when the pilot detected a problem with his plane. Most of the 102 passengers, including six survivors of the crash Wednesday, left about two hours later on another plane, <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> officials said. Federal investigators determined that the flaps and slats aboard a <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> MD-80 had not been properly set for takeoff when that plane crashed Aug. 16, 1987, at <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> Metropolitan airport, killing 156 people. <PERSON> Dickinson </PERSON> cautioned that the <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION> investigation team had just begun to study positions of the <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> aircraft's wings and slats. <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION> investigators said none of the witnesses they interviewed who were on nearby planes could tell them the position of the airplane's flaps. <PERSON> Dickinson </PERSON> said investigators have not talked to the crew, but hoped to interview First Officer <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirkland </PERSON> on Friday. The <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION> official also said control tower personnel indicated the <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 727 took off at an angle that was higher than normal. Control tower workers who watched the plane leaving told investigators the plane had a `` nose high attitude of 15 to 20 degrees.'' `` Investigators assume that they meant that was higher than normal,'' <PERSON> Dickinson </PERSON> said. Earlier Thursday, <PERSON> Dickinson </PERSON> told reporters the plane's crew had another indication of trouble during takeoff. A cockpit tape recording recovered from the plane showed that pilots had talked about an engine problem seconds before the jetliner crashed. `` Shortly after takeoff there was a sound, -LRB- apparently a -RRB- warning a stall condition may be approaching,'' <PERSON> Dickinson </PERSON> said. He said the sound came from the shaking of the `` stick,'' a device similar to the steering wheel that automatically makes a sound when a problem develops. `` This indicates the plane may be approaching a point where it wo n't be able to fly,'' he said. `` Shortly after that, there was some conversation about an engine problem.'' But he stressed that the warning sound could have stemmed from something besides an engine problem. He would not elaborate, except to say, `` In this case, we're talking about hydraulics.'' `` Every accident in its own way is unique,'' said <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Benson </PERSON>. `` You have to start from the beginning, put together a mosaic and slowly discover what went wrong.'' On Wednesday, the 15-year-old <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 727 failed to gain sufficient altitude, bounced three times on the runway and burst into flames. At least 95 people aboard miraculously survived by clambering or being pulled through emergency doors or through cracks in the burning fuselage into the hazy sunshine. `` Why? Why did it happen? That's the question we have to answer now,'' <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Berry </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION>'s headquarters Witnesses said there appeared to have been a fire or explosion in an engine on takeoff, <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Barker </PERSON> said. `` But that was not confirmed,'' he said. `` This was merely what some witnesses were reporting.'' Thirty to 40 investigators from the <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Pratt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <LOCATION> Whitney </LOCATION>, which manufactured the plane's three engines, fanned out over an area about the size of two football fields, examining pieces of the wrecked aircraft. Wearing gloves and carrying bags, some crawled inside the charred hulk, using the same cracks where passengers braved flaming jet fuel 24 hours earlier. They also climbed on the lone remaining attached wing, which had been turned red-hot by the fire, to peer into the cabin through blackened windows. At one point, about 20 of them gathered, peering intently at the left rear engine. They removed the engine shroud and looked inside. The cockpit recording, as well as the plane's flight data recorder, had already been recovered in good condition from the wreckage and taken to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> for analysis. <PERSON> Dickinson </PERSON> said safety board officials had listened to the cockpit tape recording just once, and they and other investigators planned to listen to again. The pilot, Capt. <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, 48, of <LOCATION> Greenville </LOCATION>, was pinned in the wreckage and had to be extricated by rescuers. He was listed in fair condition Thursday at <ORGANIZATION> Parkland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>, suffering back injuries and burns. <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> has been a <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> pilot since 1965 and a <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 727 captain for nine years. His co-pilot and engineer also survived the accident, but two <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> flight attendants were among the 13 fatalities. All of the dead were from <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. Ninety-seven passengers and a crew of seven were listed aboard the aircraft, but the exact count was uncertain because babies were not included on passenger lists. Three years ago, a <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> L-1011 crashed at the same airport, killing 137 in the worst aviation accident in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> history. <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Conley </PERSON> said none of the airline's other 727s would be pulled from service because of Wednesday's crash. `` We do n't see anything serious enough to pull any planes,'' he said.

<HEAD>Pinochet Lifts Ban on Exiles; Opponents Dismiss Move As

 Right-wing President <PERSON> Augusto </PERSON> <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> announced that hundreds of his critics living in exile may return to <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION>, but opponents said the move, and others like it, are aimed only at winning votes in a presidential referendum. Four hours after Thursday's announcement, <PERSON> Isabel </PERSON> <PERSON> Allende </PERSON>, 44, the daughter of former President <PERSON> Salvador </PERSON> <PERSON> Allende </PERSON>, flew to <LOCATION> Santiago </LOCATION>. She has been living in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> since her father, a self-proclaimed Marxist, died during a bloody coup led by <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> 15 years ago. Asked why she returned, she told reporters at the airport, `` Because it's my legitimate right.'' She said her mother, <PERSON> Hortensia </PERSON> <PERSON> Bussi </PERSON>, the exiled widow of Allende, also plans to return. `` We are going to prepare a grand entrance, through the front door, as we've always said,'' Ms. <PERSON> Allende </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Oyarce </PERSON>, a Communist who was labor minister in the <PERSON> Allende </PERSON> government, returned to his homeland on the same flight as Ms. <PERSON> Allende </PERSON>. <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> lifted a ban on the return of 430 Chileans who had opposed him, including some of the fiercest leftist opponents of his military government. `` The prohibitions are lifted. All of them,'' the president told reporters. `` I have spoken this morning with the interior minister and have given instructions with respect to exile that totally solves this problem.'' Opponents said the army general is only trying to lure voters in an Oct. 5 presidential referendum in which <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> is the sole candidate. His nomination for the referendum was made Tuesday by <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> himself and the commanders of the navy, air force and national police. It sparked nationwide anti-government protests. If the majority of Chileans vote `` no'' in the ballot, an open election is to be held. If they vote `` yes,'' <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> would begin an eight-year term as president in March. `` The regime is trying to change -LRB- <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>'s -RRB- image on the eve of the referendum,'' said <PERSON> Patricio </PERSON> <PERSON> Aylwin </PERSON>, leader of a 16-party opposition coalition. <PERSON> Aylwin </PERSON> challenged <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> to a `` free and open'' debate on national television, `` so he can have the opportunity to contrast his ideas with those of the opposition.'' In another move opponents say was aimed at winning the referendum, <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> last week lifted the state of emergency that has suppressed civil liberties since the 1973 coup. The president also ordered a 3 percent reduction in the price of gasoline. On Wednesday, <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> made a conciliatory gesture toward his critics, appealing for their support in a nationally televised speech. `` There is a new democracy ahead of us. We must work together to make it efficient,'' the 72-year-old general said. `` Our democracy has a place for everybody.'' The tone of the speech contrasted sharply with <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>'s past references to opposition leaders, whom he has called `` traitors'' and `` bandits'' who `` sell out their motherland.'' <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> told reporters at the government palace Thursday that he is not shifting his style in an effort to change his authoritarian image. `` What happens is that a person must act according to the circumstances,'' he said. Supporters praised <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>'s moves as proof of his intention to hold an honest referendum. `` The decision of ending exile is part of the President's appeal to peace and unity of all Chileans,'' said Interior Minister <PERSON> Sergio </PERSON> <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON>. <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Cabello </PERSON>, leader of an independent organization supporting <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>, said `` the move shows the President's deep democratic conviction.'' But <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanfuentes </PERSON>, a spokesman for the outlawed <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, said: `` <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> will take other measures to try to buy out the consciences of Chileans, but these measures will not prevent the collapse of his dictatorship.''

<TEXT>
 The unprecedented chaos in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> while President <PERSON> Miguel </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> la </PERSON> <PERSON> Madrid </PERSON> delivered his last address to the nation drew a blizzard of criticism and praise, with some calling it offensive and others saying it was just democracy in action. Opposition delegates interrupted de la <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION> continuously Thursday in a series of displays never before seen in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, which has been absolutely controlled by the <ORGANIZATION> Institutional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, or <ORGANIZATION> PRI </ORGANIZATION>, for 59 years. The outbursts included chants of `` Fraud!'' and `` <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>!'' Opposition delegates waved what they said were burned, invalidated ballots and staged a walkout that almost degenerated into a brawl. De la <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION> maintained his composure throughout the 3 -LCB- - hour speech as he sought to sum up a six-year term that began in near bankruptcy and is ending with economic reform and political controversy `` Let us be tolerant, even in the face of the insults of our political adversaries,'' he said, departing from his prepared text after the walkout. The noisy demonstrations `` showed the delegates' courage'' in demanding explanations, said <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> presidential candidate <PERSON> Cuauhtemoc </PERSON> <PERSON> Cardenas </PERSON>, who claims fraud cheated him of victory in the July 6 elections. The general secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> PRI </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Camacho </PERSON> <PERSON> Solis </PERSON>, praised de la <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION>'s coolness and condemned the protesters for `` immaturity'' and `` anti-democratic practices.'' <PERSON> Fidel </PERSON> <PERSON> Velazquez </PERSON>, the crusty 87-year-old labor leader who heads one of the strongest sections of the governing party, said he'd never seen anything like it `` But then, we never had such silly opposition before,'' he added. Later, a Democratic Front delegate, <PERSON> Salvador </PERSON> <PERSON> Miranda </PERSON> <PERSON> Polanco </PERSON>, announced he was changing his loyalty to the <ORGANIZATION> PRI </ORGANIZATION> in part because he `` does not agree with fascist ideologies.'' A presidential spokesman, who in accord with standard practice could not be named, was more sanguine. The protests, he said, were `` normal in any parliamentary system.'' The speech was interrupted regularly from the beginning, but the climax came when leftist <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> delegates led by Sen. <PERSON> Porfirio </PERSON> <PERSON> Munoz </PERSON> <PERSON> Ledo </PERSON> walked out amid shouts of `` Traitor,'' `` Get out, <PERSON> Judas </PERSON>,'' and assorted obscenities. <PERSON> Munoz </PERSON> <PERSON> Ledo </PERSON>, who was once president of the <ORGANIZATION> PRI </ORGANIZATION>, was kicked in the rear and hit in the neck by two PRI state governors. A governing party legislator grabbed <PERSON> Munoz </PERSON> <PERSON> Ledo </PERSON> and asked, `` What is happening to you? This is not the time, brother.'' The galleries, filled with <ORGANIZATION> PRI </ORGANIZATION> supporters, wives and military brass, roared disapproval and governing party delegates chanted `` <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>!'' to drown out the opposition. `` We are walking out in protest because they refused to let the voice of the opposition be heard,'' <PERSON> Munoz </PERSON> <PERSON> Ledo </PERSON> declared. De la <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION>'s speech, he said, was full of `` falsehoods and inaccuracies.'' Members of the rightist <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> demonstrated but did not walk out. Party leader <PERSON> Abel </PERSON> <PERSON> Vincenio </PERSON> <PERSON> Tovar </PERSON> said he `` respected the gesture'' but preferred less `` hysterical'' means. He criticized the <ORGANIZATION> PRI </ORGANIZATION> for packing the house. His party, with 101 delegates, was allowed to invite a total of four spectators, he said. `` When the ruling party does n't have the backing of the people, they have to bring their own supporters,'' he said. The same fractious <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> must, in the next two months, certify the election of de la <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION>'s successor, <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Gortari </PERSON>, who did not attend. <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> is scheduled to take over Dec. 1. The most strident objections came when de la <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION> spoke of the controversial July 6 vote, which he praised as `` historic,'' but there were also interruptions as he spoke of his economic reforms. The reforms reduced state control of the economy, kept the nation out of bankruptcy and controlled inflation, but also reduced the average Mexican's buying power by about 50 percent. De la <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION>'s own election reforms broke the governing party's stranglehold and allowed opposition strength to grow Before <PERSON> Miranda </PERSON>'s announced switch, the <ORGANIZATION> PRI </ORGANIZATION> held 260 seats in the <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deputies </ORGANIZATION> to 139 for the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION>'s 101 The <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> also holds four of 64 <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> seats. National Action holds none. State-controlled Mexican television showed some of the protests during a live broadcast of the speech. Although the cameras shied away during the walkout, shouts and curses were audible. Mexicans later watched the entire incident on news shows.

 Fire-plagued <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> reopened its south gate Thursday for the first time in almost two weeks, but was forced to close the west entrance late in the day when a 109,100-acre blaze flared up. Elsewhere in the West, officials took measures to keep hunters, fishers and campers out of the woods over Labor Day weekend. In eastern <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>, officials banned recreational users from 3.8 million acres of state-protected forest and range land, effective Friday _ the first day of the long holiday weekend. Already closed are 2.8 million acres of land in western <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>. `` The state needs to limit the risk of wildfire, and this has proven to be an effective way to do that,'' State Forester <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said. Last year, 10.3 million acres in western <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> were closed to the public for 11 days because of extreme fire danger. In that period, fires blamed on human activities dropped from six to one a day, said <PERSON> Kathy </PERSON> <PERSON> Apling </PERSON>, a state forestry spokeswoman. Strict fire restrictions have also been imposed throughout <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state, said <PERSON> Kathy </PERSON> <PERSON> Albert </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> spokesperson. `` Our message to everyone is no campfires unless in developed campsites, with the exception of using a pressurized-liquid gas camping stove,'' she said. Fires also burned Thursday in <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>, the hunting season was scheduled to begin Thursday, but a reluctant state Fish and <ORGANIZATION> Game </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> agreed _ at the request of Gov. <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Schwinden </PERSON> _ to postpone the start of all hunting seasons until Sept. 16 because of the fire danger. The delay affected as many as 75,000 hunters, state officials said. <PERSON> Schwinden </PERSON> had succinct advice for people who were thinking about going to the woods over the weekend: `` Find some asphalt.'' Ten major fires burned in the state Thursday. One of two huge fires north of <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION> tore through a fire line late Wednesday and continued burning toward a dude ranch, fire officials in <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> said. `` We've got major fires on both sides of the Silvertip Ranch,'' fire information officer <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Comstock </PERSON> said Thursday. The Storm <LOCATION> Creek </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Hellroaring </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Creek </LOCATION> fires in the Absaroka-Beartooth Wilderness have charred more than 90,000 acres and were only three miles apart. `` Down-canyon'' wind blew the flames of the <LOCATION> Storm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Creek </LOCATION> blaze through a 5.5-mile fire line that crews had spent four days building in rugged country, fire information officer <PERSON> Nick </PERSON> <PERSON> Tafoya </PERSON> said. Near <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Yellowstone </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mont. </LOCATION>, crews used bulldozers to carve a 12-foot wide fire line between the gateway town and the western flank of the North Fork fire inside the nation's oldest national park. The gray sky seemed to be raining ash Thursday afternoon, with visibility was down to a half mile and a light breeze keeping the snow-like ash in the air. By nighttime, `` slop-over'' from the fire line reached within 1 -LCB- miles of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Yellowstone </LOCATION>. `` There's a lot of flame and a lot of smoke out there. The fire is extremely visible from town,'' said <PERSON> Kathy </PERSON> <PERSON> Good </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> spokesman in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Yellowstone </LOCATION>. All five gates to the park and all roads within it were open for a tim Thursday, until the worsening conditions caused the closure of the west entrance. Park spokesman <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Stalker </PERSON> said the west entrance was expected to reopen within a few hours once the spot fires were taken care of. The park's chief naturalist, <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>, said officials anticipated that the fires `` will keep burning until the first heavy winter snows.'' In <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>, the Tepee Butte fire, the state's largest wildfire this year, has burned 40,316 acres of grass and timber in the <ORGANIZATION> Wallowa-Whitman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> and the Hell's <ORGANIZATION> Canyon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Recreation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Area </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> DeHart </PERSON>, spokesman for the multiagency fire coordination center in <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>. The fire will grow to 59,000 acres before it reaches fire lines, <PERSON> DeHart </PERSON> added. Firefighters struggled to contain five major fires in the mountain ranges of <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. A 6-year-old boy playing with matches started a fire Wednesday that destroyed two homes and charred 560 acres south of <LOCATION> Mariposa </LOCATION>, a town 150 miles east of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Kary </PERSON> <PERSON> Weaver </PERSON>, a state department of forestry spokeswoman. About 100 people were evacuated from the neighborhood, she said. One of three major fires in northeastern <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state roared through containment lines, but authorities reported progress in containing the other two blazes. Wildfires have charred more than 24,500 acres in the state. In <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, more than 3,000 firefighters remained on the lines of the worst of the 17 major fires burning over 70,000 acres. Overnight winds whipped a once-controlled fire near northern <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>'s Pineview Reserevoir into a fast-moving inferno that jumped fire lines and more than doubled to 1,200 acres by Thursday, fire officials said.'

 <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> says it hopes to raise the conscience of youth when <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Springsteen </PERSON>, <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Gabriel </PERSON>, and other rock stars launch a worldwide concert tour dedicated to human rights. The six-week tour, which opens tonight at <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Wembley </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Stadium </LOCATION>, will go to 20 cities in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. The $ 23 million extravaganza is to mark the 40th anniversary of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Universal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Declaration </ORGANIZATION> on Human Rights. Organizers expect sell-out crowds but stress that raising money is not the sole intention. `` This tour is not about charity, it's about justice,'' said <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Healey </PERSON>, head of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> division of the organization, which monitors human rights abuses and won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1977. `` What we're talking about is human rights and the seriousness of the issue ... there's too much torture, too many people being killed,'' he said. The pop stars taking part are both realistic and romantic about playing for human rights. `` When I was younger I thought maybe you could pick a guitar up and you could change the world,'' <PERSON> Springsteen </PERSON>, 38, said at a news conference Thursday. `` I do n't really believe that any more. But I do believe you can save a life,'' he added. `` Someone comes to the show, they hear the message, they hear what we are singing about, they go home, they write a letter and someone gets out of prison early. That's pretty good.'' <PERSON> Springsteen </PERSON> is sharing a bill on the 35,000-mile tour with <PERSON> Gabriel </PERSON> and Sting, American folk singer <PERSON> Tracey </PERSON> <PERSON> Chapman </PERSON> and <PERSON> Sengal </PERSON>'s Youssou N'Dour More than 1 million people are expected to see the concerts live, with televison audiences of many more. Ticket prices vary from rich to poorer countries _ $ 37.60 in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> and $ 3 in <LOCATION> Budapest </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>. The final concert is scheduled in the Argentine capital, <LOCATION> Buenos </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aires </LOCATION>, on Oct. 15. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> sports goods manufacturer <ORGANIZATION> Reebok </ORGANIZATION> has underwritten the cost of the tour, and organizers say they hope it will break even. `` This is definitely not for fund-raising,'' said <PERSON> Healey </PERSON>, who put together a two-week American tour called `` Conspiracy of Hope'' in 1986 featuring <PERSON> Gabriel </PERSON>, Sting and an Irish group, U2. It convinced him that rock music works for human rights. Amnesty's <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> membership rose by 100,000 to 250,000 in the year following the tour. The organization has a worldwide membership of 750,000. Every audience member will get a card with the text of the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> declaration on human rights. Spectators will also be able to sign slips of paper saying they uphold the declaration. At the end of tour, Amnesty plans to deliver these to the governments of the nations visited. Amnesty's venture is the latest using rock music to raise consciences. Irish rock singer <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Geldof </PERSON>'s Live Aid concert in 1985 raised millions of dollars for the starving Ethiopians, and this year thousands turned out to mark South African black leader <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>'s 70th birthday with a <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> concert. `` The reason we have an appeal for the young is, I believe, the fact that they are still able to say when they hear of an individual's plight, ` But that's not fair,''' said <PERSON> Marie </PERSON> <PERSON> Staunton </PERSON>, director of <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION>'s British section. <PERSON> Gabriel </PERSON>, a longtime campaigner for <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION>, said he agreed with critics that a song wo n't change the behavior of a dictator. `` But we hope it can affect the way his children and his grandchildren think. ... These are our target,'' said <PERSON> Gabriel </PERSON>.

U.S.</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE GEDDA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> normally casts a benign eye on countries that welcome foreign investment, engage in free trade, repay their debts, respect their neighbors and oppose communism. There are n't many countries with all these perceived virtues, but one that does _ <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION> _ has had a virutally unbroken record of poor relations with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for 15 years. This seemingly anomalous situation has occurred because of <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION>'s military president, <PERSON> Augusto </PERSON> <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>, whose human rights abuses and distrust for democracy have more than offset aspects of his rule which generally get an approving nod from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. Lately, the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration has adopted a friendlier view toward <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> now that many civil liberties have been restored as the country gears up for a presidential plebiscite next month in which the 72-year-old general will be the lone candidate. Top military commanders announced their selection of <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> on Tuesday, touching off a wave of protests that led to the deaths of at least three people and the arrests of more than 1,000 others. While the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has kept its distance, diplomatically, from the general for years, <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> himself has been scornful of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, telling <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> visitors that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> leaders should be more appreciative of a government that deposed a Marxist-led regime, an event virtually without precedent. Indeed, some American officials, citing <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>'s economic and foreign policies, believe long years of <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration hostility toward <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION> was misguided. As an example, with the exception of <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION> sided with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> on more <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> votes than any other Latin American country during the last General Assembly session. Among all Third World nations, only <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> were more supportive of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s positions. Beyond that, while other hemispheric countries are mired in economic crisis, <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION> boasted a healthy 5.4 percent growth rate last year, using market-oriented policies the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> advocates. And unlike many other hemispheric countries, <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION> pays its debts, allows foreign investors to remit profits and has been selling off state-run enterprises. Also winning sympathy for <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> among some officials is the presence of well-armed guerrilla groups which have staged repeated terrorist attacks over the years. But at a time when the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has been emphasizing democractic development in the hemisphere, the administration felt it could not make an exception by showing friendship toward <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>. The administration's attempts to promote democracy in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> would lose credibility if <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION> were exempted from this policy, officials contended, overriding those who favored greater recognition of the positive side of <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>'s rule. Beyond that, the Democratic majority in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, many of whom have bitter memories of the early years of the <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> regime, strongly oppose any accommodation with <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION>. Whatever gratitude <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> generated in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> for ousting President <PERSON> Salvador </PERSON> <PERSON> Allende </PERSON> in 1973 was short-lived because of way he dealt with those who opposed him. As outlined by <PERSON> Aryeh </PERSON> <PERSON> Neier </PERSON>, director of Americas Watch, a New York-based human rights group, there were a `` huge number'' of killings in <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION> during those early years. `` Nobody knows the actual count,'' he says. Some political activists disappeared without a trace and there were widespread allegations that political detainees were tortured. American alienation from <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION> was aggravated when <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> investigators blamed Chilean security agents for the 1976 car-bombing death in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> of a former top <PERSON> Allende </PERSON> aide, <PERSON> Orlando </PERSON> <PERSON> Letelier </PERSON>. This was one of the most notorious incidents of international terrorism ever to occur on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> soil. A decade ago, <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION> was a major target of the fresh emphasis on human rights introduced by President <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>. Nowadays, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> focus is on democracy in the hemisphere and, at long last, the prospect of the first genuine electoral test in <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION> since 1973 has induced hopes in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> that representative democracy may return to <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION>. Still, the long record of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> hostility toward <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> contrasts sharply with the friendship the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> demonstrated for years toward another Third World military strongman, President <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> <PERSON> ul-Haq </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, who was killed in a plane crash two weeks ago. The records of both <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> and Pinochet on human rights are similar. For <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, the difference is that <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> ruled a strategically important country and <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> does n't.

<HEAD>Bush, Dukakis Have Mixed Records on Environment</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER CONNELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 At the close of a summer when Americans baked under extreme heat and watched beaches fouled by medical wastes, <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> are both fighting hard to convince voters they are friends of the environment. Republican nominee <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who boasts `` I am an environmentalist, always have been,'' finds himself battling both <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and a <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration record that environmental groups contend was often inimical to the causes of clean air, land and water. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> took that battle to <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION> on Thursday, where he accused the Democratic nominee of dragging his heels while the pollution-clogged harbor got `` dirtier and dirtier.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> ridiculed <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s `` election-year conversion,'' saying <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> harbor has `` been polluted for hundreds of years, and I'm very proud to be the governor who's cleaning it up ... no thanks to Vice President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and the administration he is part of. `` <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION> is not <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' shining moment,'' said <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Webb </PERSON>, a Friends of the <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> lobbyist. `` But that's one issue in one state. What about eight years of neglect?'' In a March assessment, the <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conservation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Voters </ORGANIZATION> league gave <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> a grade of B and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> a D-plus. <PERSON> Arlene </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Donnell </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Audubon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has exhibited a growing sensitivity to environmental issues, although `` he still tends, on bulldozer-versus-trees kind of things, to take the business side.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said Wednesday that `` 1988, in a sense, is the year the Earth spoke back.'' He called for an international conference next year to discuss global warming and ozone depletion, which may be behind the unusually hot summer. Republicans say one of their own, <PERSON> Teddy </PERSON> <PERSON> Roosevelt </PERSON>, was one of the first environmentalists, and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> hopes to reclaim the environmental mantle for the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION>. But to do that, he must overcome distrust left by President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s problems with the Superfund to clean up toxic waste, the president's go-slow attitude toward new measures to curb acid rain _ measures <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> endorsed in a speech Wednesday _ and <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s 1987 veto of a $ 20 billion authorization to clean up <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> waterways. Environmentalists also criticize <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> for heading a deregulation task force that paved the way for a <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> executive order giving the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> veto power over environmental and other regulations. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has promised to revoke that executive order. In reply to a questionnaire from the <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conservation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Voters </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said: `` In the past few years, we have not done enough to protect the environment. I will do more.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has backed a goal of `` no net loss of wetlands.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has called for protecting existing wetlands and restoring `` part of the vast endowment of wetlands that <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> has lost.'' But his administration approved filling a swamp for a shopping center near <LOCATION> Attleboro </LOCATION>, a development the <ORGANIZATION> Reagan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> went to court to block. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has won high marks among some environmentalists for his dogged battle to block licensing of the stillborn <LOCATION> Seabrook </LOCATION> nuclear plant in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>, as well as court fights to block oil drilling in the <ORGANIZATION> Georges </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> off the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> coast. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, himself a pioneer of the offshore drilling industry, last spring endorsed a moratorium on drilling in sensitive offshore areas such as <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. He also has promised to seek an end to dumping of wastes in the ocean by 1991. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> recently supported offshore drilling in a <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> appearance, prompting the Democrat to declare that the nation needed `` a president whose environmental policy does n't change with the time zones.'' On nuclear power, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> opposes construction of new commercial reactors until a new, safer design is developed and ways are found to treat and dispose of nuclear waste. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> says, `` I believe nuclear power must be a part of our energy mix,'' and says he will `` insist on the highest safety standards.'' On acid rain, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> promised Wednesday to ask <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to cut millions of tons of sulfur dioxide emissions by the year 2,000 and to reduce nitrogen oxide emissions. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has said he will use authority under existing law to force industrial states `` that are major contributors to the acid rain problem to find solutions within three years.'' Both favor `` clean coal'' research to tap the nation's abundant supply of fossil fuel.

 Investigators examining the <ORGANIZATION> Pratt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Whitney </PERSON> JT8D engine as a possible cause of Wednesday's <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lines </ORGANIZATION> crash are scrutinizing a powerplant with which the aircraft industry has conducted a quarter-century love affair. Almost 12,000 of the engines have been sold since the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> approved them in 1964. Today, they are used by 350 airlines, governments and corporations and are more widely utilized than all other commercial jet engines combined, <ORGANIZATION> Pratt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <LOCATION> Whitney </LOCATION> spokesman <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Long </PERSON> said Thursday. `` It's one of the more reliable engines on the market today,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> McFadden </PERSON>, aerospace analyst for <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Capital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Markets </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Even before <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> Flight 1141 plunged to the ground Wednesday shortly after takeoff from <LOCATION> Dallas-Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>, the government had named the JT8D as contributing to two major accidents that occurred in 1985. On Thursday, <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> member <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Dickinson </PERSON> said recordings of cockpit conversations on Flight 1141 before the accident revealed discussions of engine problems and noises indicating a stall may have been imminent. Witnesses reported seeing flames streaming from an engine just before the crash. Thirteen people were killed, but nearly 100 survived the fiery wreck. Despite those blemishes, the engine is so reliable the government uses the frequency rate with which they break down in flight as the benchmark against which new engines are measured. So far this year, the JT8Ds have shut down in flight 0.012 times per 1,000 hours of flight, <PERSON> Long </PERSON> said from <ORGANIZATION> Pratt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <LOCATION> Whitney </LOCATION> offices in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hartford </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn </LOCATION>. According to <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Pardee </PERSON>, manager of the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION>'s engine certification office in <LOCATION> Burlington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, some engines have been known to shut down one or two times per 1,000 hours of flight. `` It's a goal we require all new technologies to meet,'' <PERSON> Pardee </PERSON> said of the JT8D's performance statistics. All <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 727s _ Flight 1141 was a 727 _ use three of the engines mounted on the rear of the aircraft. They are also used on many <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 737s and <ORGANIZATION> McDonnell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION> DC-9s. In addition, <ORGANIZATION> McDonnell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION> MD-80s use JT8D-200s, an advanced model of the engine. <ORGANIZATION> Pratt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Whitney </PERSON> estimates that in all, the engines have flown more than 400 million hours in nearly a quarter-century of service. `` For an engine to be around for 25 years says a lot about its acceptance,'' said <PERSON> McFadden </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION>. But problems with the JT8D have been blamed by government officials as contributing to two major air accidents in 1985. In <LOCATION> Manchester </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, in August of that year, the engine's combustion chamber cracked and burned through on a British <ORGANIZATION> AirTours </ORGANIZATION> jetliner during takeoff Fifty-five people died when the plane caught fire. The accident sparked widespread inspections of combustion chambers of older, high-use JT8D engines as well as a requirement for more frequent inspections to check for cracks. The next month, a <ORGANIZATION> Midwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> DC-9 crashed in <LOCATION> Milwaukee </LOCATION>, killing 31 people, in an accident that was blamed on a fracture of the engine spacers, which separate the turbine blades. Afterward, the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> ordered owners of planes with the engines to conduct inspections looking for cracks, and to replace the spacers periodically.

 The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> expects to lose up to half its professional staff to retirement over the next decade and will need an aggressive recruitment campaign to find new agents, the bureau's director says <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sessions </PERSON> said at a luncheon meeting Thursday that the recruitment demands make it even more challenging to find women and minorities for the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>. `` It is clear that we must develop effective measures to respond to our extraordinary hiring needs,'' Sessions said. `` Somehow it feels like bobbing for apples at <LOCATION> Halloween </LOCATION> with your hands behind your back.'' Not only has the pool of college graduates begun a projected 10-year decline, the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> does not have the salaries and employee benefits to compete with private industry, Sessions said. `` We have esprit; we have an important and urgent mission; we have the strong call of meaningful public service. But we must still battle to gain the agents with the skills and education necessary to fulfill our mission.'' Within nine years, <PERSON> Sessions </PERSON> said, more than half the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>'s professionals _ about 4,500 people _ will either be forced or eligible to retire Sessions said that as part of the recruitment effort he has approved a five-year minority hiring program designed to increase the number of blacks and Hispanics in the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>. Out of 9,597 agents, 417 are black and 439 are Hispanic. In the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> population, blacks account for about 12 percent and Hispanics make up about 8 percent. Sessions, a former federal judge, said that since he became <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> director 10 months ago he has moved to eliminate racism and discrimination. `` From the beginning, I have tried to make the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>'s policy against racism and discrimination crystal clear to every member of the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>, both by policy statements ... and by personally addressing employees,'' he said. But he refused to talk about pending legal actions taken by a group of Hispanic agents and by a black agent. More than 300 of the bureau's Hispanic agents have filed a class-action suit in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paso </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, contending the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> discriminates against them in promotions, discipline and assignments. A federal judge is expected to issue a decision in the case by Oct. 1. The Hispanics seek unspecified damages and changes in <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> policies. In the other case, <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Rochon </PERSON>, a black agent in the <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> office, has filed racial harassment charges against the government. The <ORGANIZATION> Equal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Employment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Opportunity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> has already upheld many of <PERSON> Rochon </PERSON>'s complaints, stemming from his tenure in the <LOCATION> Omaha </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Neb. </LOCATION>, office. Sessions acknowledged that the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> must make improvements so its agent workforce will `` more nearly reflect our nation's ethnic composition.'' He said the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> is seeking to hire women and minorities in specialties needed increasingly by the bureau: linguists, engineers, computer scientists, lawyers and accountants.

<HEAD>Food Price Hike Fears Exaggerated, Economist Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM DRINKARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Consumers who are braced for higher food prices because of the summer's drought should breathe a little easier, says an <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> economist. Fears that the total at the checkout counter is going to shoot upward because of farmers' problems are largely based on erroneous assumptions about the way food prices are set and on exaggerations of the drought's effects on food supplies, says <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Parlett </PERSON> of the department's <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. `` Although grain and soybean stocks are not as large as they were in some prior drought years, we are in no foreseeable danger of running out of food,'' <PERSON> Parlett </PERSON> says in an article in the department's Farmline magazine. `` Supplies of grains are more than ample to meet demand,'' <PERSON> Parlett </PERSON> said. Winter wheat, used for baking bread, was harvested before the drought struck. Meat and poultry production is expected to hit record levels, and most fruit and vegetable crops will be undamaged because they are grown under irrigation, he said. The bottom line: overall food prices, which had previously been forecast to rise 2 to 4 percent this year, now are expected to go up 3 to 5 percent _ a one-point boost because of the dry weather. There is concern, however, that some middlemen in the food chain might seek to exploit the dry conditions as an excuse for higher prices. At least two members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> _ Rep. <PERSON> Byron </PERSON> <PERSON> Dorgan </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.D. </LOCATION>, and Sen. <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Leahy </PERSON>, D-Vt., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> _ have asked the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> to monitor food prices for evidence of gouging `` We know that in previous times, gouging has occurred,'' <PERSON> Dorgan </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>' investigative arm, will track food prices at the farm, the wholesale and retail levels for a marketbasket that includes white bread, choice beef, chicken, bacon, milk, fruit, vegetables, ground beef, chuck roast, spaghetti and macaroni. `` People vote with their food dollars,'' said <PERSON> Dorgan </PERSON>. `` If we find price gouging, the ability to spotlight that ... will persuade consumers to move their dollars toward other brands or other commodities.'' <PERSON> Parlett </PERSON> said most affected by price increases will be pasta products, which are made from drought-damaged durum wheat, vegetable oils, oat-based cereals and a few fruits and vegetables such as sweet corn, peas, dry beans and tart cherries. Fresh fruit and vegetable supplies and quality have been affected in some non-irrigated drought areas where food stores look to local farmers to fill their produce departments during the growing season. But most produce effects were felt in areas where vegetables are grown for canning, <PERSON> Parlett </PERSON> said. Fears that drought translates into sharply higher food prices are founded on some false assumptions, the economist said. If shortages do result in higher commodity prices for farmers, the effect is greatly diluted by the time the product reaches the consumer because the farm value of foods accounts for an average of only 30 percent of their retail price. Most of the cost of an item is in its processing, packaging and marketing. In addition, said <PERSON> Parlett </PERSON>, food middlemen tend to absorb at least some of the short-term fluctuations in farm prices. And since food production is geographically diversified, even widespread droughts affect only certain production sectors. With commodities such as grains, which are in surplus, reserves are available to make up for drought-attenuated crops. Dry weather has a reverse effect on meat supplies, usually forcing increases in slaughter and a supply glut which tends to hold down consumer prices in the short run. The reduced cattle and hog numbers could have a delayed upward influence on prices, however, probably leading to price increases next year, said <PERSON> Parlett </PERSON>. Historically, food prices tend to rise every year regardless of farm prices, he said. In the 1980 drought year food prices rose 8.6 percent, but that was down from 10.9 percent in 1979 when crops were good, he pointed out. Another drought in 1983 was accompanied by a 2.1 percent food cost rise, the lowest since 1967.

 The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has bought an additional 100,000 metric tons for delivery this year under a long-term supply agreement between the two countries, the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> says. A metric ton is about 2,205 pounds and is equal to 39.4 bushels of corn or 36.7 bushels of wheat or soybeans. The 100,000 tons of corn would be about 3.9 million bushels. Corn prices have been averaging about $ 2.49 per bushel at the farm level, meaning that the sale could have a farm value of around $ 9.8 million. The corn is part of the grain the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> is committed to buy during the fifth and final year of the agreement, which calls for the annual purchase of at least 9 million tons of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> grain. The pact expires Sept. 30, and there have been negotiations for a new one. According to the agreement, the annual purchases are supposed to include a minimum of 4 million tons each of wheat and corn. The Soviets have the option of buying the remaining 1 million tons as wheat, corn or soybeans, with every ton of beans counting as two tons of grain _ up to a maximum of 1 million tons of grain equivalent. If the latest purchase is shipped before the current agreement expires, the Soviets will have bought 5.27 million tons of corn, in addition to more than 9 million tons of wheat; 830,700 tons of soybeans, and 1.3 million tons of soybean meal.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Occupational </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> has failed to enforce laws protecting the nation's workers, a failure contributing to thousands of workplace deaths, a critic of the federal agency says A report being released today by the Chicago-based <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workplace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> concluded that <ORGANIZATION> OSHA </ORGANIZATION>'s ineffectiveness and unwillingness to be tough with violators has resulted in more than 9,000 avoidable workplace fatalities since 1981. However, statisticians and the federal agency disputed the figure and said on-the-job deaths have declined sharply during the 1980s. `` This report represents a selective use of statistics,'' <ORGANIZATION> OSHA </ORGANIZATION>'s chief spokesman, <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Mikelson </PERSON>, said `` It creates the impression that more and more people are being killed at work, that more and more people are being hurt, when just the opposite is true.'' The institute, which is supported by foundation grants and private contributions, said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has become `` a first-rate nation with a second-rate record of protecting -LRB- its -RRB- workers.'' `` We have to agree with some of what they say,'' said <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Seminario </PERSON>, associate director of safety and health for the <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION>. `` We really do have some serious problems with <ORGANIZATION> OSHA </ORGANIZATION>.'' The report, a copy of which was obtained Thursday, accused the agency of inconsistency and criticized `` sweetheart deals'' that reduced fines against large corporate violators. For example, it said <ORGANIZATION> OSHA </ORGANIZATION> proposed fines of $ 1.48 million against <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carbide </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> in 1986 but accepted a settlement of $ 408,500. But <PERSON> Mikelson </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> OSHA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, said, `` Historically, the agency has reduced penalties in the interest of obtaining immediate abatement of hazards. That is our mission: to correct hazards, to get them out of the workplace, and we've done that.'' The report said <ORGANIZATION> OSHA </ORGANIZATION> does not have a comprehensive program to target employers for inspections. It said <ORGANIZATION> OSHA </ORGANIZATION> inspectors were three times more likely to issue their most serious sanction, a willful citation, in fiscal 1980 _ before President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> took office _ than in fiscal 1981 through 1987. `` <ORGANIZATION> OSHA </ORGANIZATION>'s senior staff has failed to provide leadership to make its civil enforcement programs effective,'' the institute said. `` That failure has cost lives. If we had continued improving job safety at the same rate which was in place in 1980, 9,115 workplace fatality victims would still be alive today.'' The conclusion was based on a statistical analysis reflecting a change in the rate of deaths among workers in high-risk jobs: agriculture, construction, transportation and manufacturing. It said the rate of high-risk deaths declined by an annual rate of 2.2 percent from 1975 through 1980 and by 0.7 percent from 1981 through 1987. The Chicago-based <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, whose data was used in the analysis, said the death toll from on-the-job accidents has fallen from 13,000 in 1975 to 11,100 last year. `` It may be they're hoping people wo n't look into how they arrived at their conclusions and just take them at face value,'' said <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoskin </PERSON>, the council's director of statistics. He said the six-year period used to determine the death trend was too short and the assumption of a constant decline in fatalities `` very rarely exists in the real world.'' `` We very carefully researched the methodology with the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Statistical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>,'' said <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kinney </PERSON>, executive director of the institute. `` They checked everything out and think our approach was very fair.'' The <ORGANIZATION> ASA </ORGANIZATION>'s executive director, <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Bailar </PERSON>, disagreed. `` I do n't think anybody really looked at it very carefully,'' she said. `` I think that's an extremely dangerous thing to do. Projections are noted for having a lot of problems with them.''

<HEAD>FCC Sets Development Rules for Enhanced TV Technology</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The broadcast and electronics industries are praising the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>'s endorsement of advanced television systems with enhanced sound and picture quality. The <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday declared the new systems in the public interest and approved some preliminary rules for bringing them into American homes. But the commission said many technical and procedural problems still must be ironed out. The `` high definition'' TV systems will be designed to have the clarity of movie film and the sound of compact discs. They probably will not be available from the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> broadcast industry before 1993, according to an official of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasters </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Rau </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> NAB </ORGANIZATION>'s vice president for science and technology, said the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> made a `` strong commitment to bring advanced TV to the public. They seemed to reaffirm support for free, over-the-air broadcasting. `` But the commission must solve the difficulties of delivering the system over broadcast outlets.'' In a series of preliminary rulings, the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> said: _ Existing broadcasters and stations are best equipped to bring the new system to viewers _ Advanced television programs must be received on existing television sets so viewers wo n't have to replace their equipment _ If additional frequency space is needed, it should be found within existing VHF and UHF television bands The <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> found that looking for frequencies outside those bands would delay the service, and noted that bands now suitable for the systems are in use for other purposes. <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosenker </PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Electronics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, said his group of electronics manufacturers is `` pleased that the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION>'s decision ... has begun to define the complex issues regarding high definition television so that the American public will be able to enjoy the benefits ... within a relatively short period.'' The <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> sought public comment on three options for using the airwaves for high definition TV. There would be a 60-day comment period and 30 days for replies. <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> and Commissioner <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> Diaz </PERSON> <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> supported all the commission's findings and proposed options. Commissioner <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Quello </PERSON> dissented on grounds the commission acted prematurely. <PERSON> Quello </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> based its preliminary findings on computer projections and should have waited until the technology was tested and developed. But <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> said the technology to improve picture resolution exists today, and the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> should spur further research and development. His view was supported by Ms. <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON>, who said: `` Some urge us to move more slowly, to wait for more evidence before acting. That is tempting ... but delay creates significant costs.'' Although <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> said the preliminary rulings would `` put the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> in the forefront of the international quest for new TV technology,'' the Japanese have been working on an advanced system for two decades.

<HEAD>US Worried About Offensive Against Anti-Marxist Rebels</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> is undertaking a major buildup of its forces in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>, raising the possibility of a joint Cuban-Angolan offensive against U.S.-backed rebels, according to <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> officials. With Cuban troop strength possibly exceeding 60,000, the officials said <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> may also be contemplating a cross-border strike into South African-controlled <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>'s southern neighbor. The Cuban buildup, accompanied by an estimated two dozen MiG23 fighter jets, helicopter gunships, tanks and other equipment, worries <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials who have been hoping for a negotiated withdrawal of the Cuban forces. Some officials believe that the Cubans may merely be attempting to improve their bargaining position at four-way talks aimed at achieving both a <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> withdrawal and Namibian independence from <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. But one official, speaking only on condition of anonymity, said the sheer numbers of Cubans and equipment involved in the buildup suggest that the Cubans are thinking more of a military offensive than a withdrawal. `` The numbers are frightening,'' the official said. The buildup began several weeks ago with about one ship a week loaded with troops and equipment undertaking the trans-Atlantic crossing. If the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> estimates are correct, <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> has increased its troop strength by about 25,000 since last November. The four-way talks involve officials from <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> serving as mediator. The next round will take place next week in the Congolese capital of <LOCATION> Brazzaville </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> concluded the withdrawal of its troops from <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> earlier this week and has said it will begin a withdrawal later this year from <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> provided <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> agrees to an early pullout from <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>. A South African pullback would set in motion a <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> plan for the establishment of an independent government in the territory. The officials said the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africans </LOCATION> decided to withdraw from <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> after recognizing that the Cuban buildup had changed the power balance in the southern part of the country, leaving South African troops vulnerable. They said South Africans may not even be a match for <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> forces in <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>, where <LOCATION> Pretoria </LOCATION> has been the colonial power for 73 years. One official said <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> has 50 percent more tanks in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> than <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> has in its entire inventory. As one official described it, <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Fidel </PERSON> <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> `` has his eye on the history books,'' possibly hoping to free <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> from South African control and to help defeat the anti-communist insurgency that has been operating in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> for 13 years. The <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION> insurgency has received <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military support for the past three years and controls much of the southeastern part of the country. The four-way talks were convened last May in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> at the suggestion of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Assistant Secretary of State <PERSON> Chester </PERSON> <PERSON> Crocker </PERSON>. At the time, officials said the parties appeared eager for a negotiated settlement, realizing that a military solution was impossible. But some officials now believe that <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> has had in mind a military solution all along, and they say that theory has been bolstered by the Cuban buildup.

<HEAD>Airlines Fined More Than $1 Million for Poor Security Inspections</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The government imposed more than $ 1 million in fines on 32 airlines for faulty airport security procedures as part of a stepped up effort to improve passenger screening. The fines announced Thursday by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> range from $ 1,000 against a number smaller, mainly commuter, airlines to $ 215,000 against <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, $ 156,000 against <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> and $ 113,000 against <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lines </ORGANIZATION>. While the passenger screening at airport checkpoints usually is conducted by private security companies, the airlines hire the companies and are responsible for the program. The fines stem from <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> tests conducted at major airports nationwide in which agency inspectors carried phony weapons through airport security checkpoints without being detected, the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> said. <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> Administrator <PERSON> Allan </PERSON> <PERSON> McArtor </PERSON> said a recent audit of the security tests conducted by the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> showed improved screening, but nearly 15 percent of the phony weapons still passed through undetected. The 85.6 percent detection rate during the first six months of the year compares with a 78.9 percent rate during all of 1987, <PERSON> McArtor </PERSON> said. He added that some airport checkpoints detected more than 95 percent of the weapons in the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> tests, he said. But <PERSON> McArtor </PERSON> said that `` while the improvement in the detection rate is encouraging,'' tough enforcement measures, including civil penalties, are needed `` to insure industry-wide improvements and system-wide safety.'' Security lapses at airport checkpoints became a focus of attention last year when a congressional report chastized the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> for the screening system's shortcomings. The subject gained additional attention after a disgruntled former <ORGANIZATION> USAir </ORGANIZATION> employee smuggled a weapon aboard a <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> jet and began shooting, causing the plane to crash. All 43 people aboard the plane, which was flying from <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, were killed. After the incident, the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> announced it was using special teams of investigators to test security at 16 major airports. Last March, <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Burnley </PERSON> said the tests would improve the effectiveness of the screening programs. `` We want to see a 100 percent success rate in detecting weapons and dummy weapons,'' <ORGANIZATION> Burnley </ORGANIZATION> said in a statement Thursday. He promised to continue the airport tests. <PERSON> McArtor </PERSON>, meanwhile, indicated that the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> may seek additional fines in the future if lapses are uncovered. `` We have no choice but to take tough enforcement action in those instances where security lapses are discovered,'' he said. Here are the airlines that were fined in the action announced Thursday. <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, $ 215,000; <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, $ 156,000; <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lines </ORGANIZATION>, $ 113,000; <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, $ 96,000; <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, $ 79,000; <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, $ 67,000; <ORGANIZATION> Trans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, $ 63,000; <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, $ 61,000; <ORGANIZATION> USAir </ORGANIZATION>, $ 58,000; <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION>, $ 51,000; <ORGANIZATION> Piedmont </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, $ 32,000; <ORGANIZATION> Alaska </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, $ 31,000. <ORGANIZATION> Southwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, $ 21,000; <ORGANIZATION> Sky </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> <LOCATION> West </LOCATION>, each $ 20,000; <ORGANIZATION> Hawaiian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, $ 12,000; <ORGANIZATION> Wings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Sun </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Country </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Braniff </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION>, each $ 10,000; <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wisconsin </ORGANIZATION>, $ 3,000; <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, $ 2,000. The following airlines each were fined $ 1,000: <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Midwest </ORGANIZATION>, Av Air, <ORGANIZATION> Brit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> ComAir </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Horizon </LOCATION>, Jetstream, <ORGANIZATION> Midwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> has merged with <ORGANIZATION> USAir </ORGANIZATION> since the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> tests that led to the fines were conducted, the agency said.

<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> normally casts a benign eye on countries that welcome foreign investment, engage in free trade, repay their debts, respect their neighbors and oppose communism. There are n't many countries with all these perceived virtues, but one that does _ <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION> _ has had a virutally unbroken record of poor relations with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for 15 years. This seemingly anomalous situation has occurred because of <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION>'s military president, <PERSON> Augusto </PERSON> <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>, whose human rights abuses and distrust for democracy have more than offset aspects of his rule which generally get an approving nod from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. Lately, the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration has adopted a friendlier view toward <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> now that many civil liberties have been restored as the country gears up for a presidential plebiscite next month in which the 72-year-old general will be the lone candidate. Top military commanders announced their selection of <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> on Tuesday, touching off a wave of protests that led to the deaths of at least three people and the arrests of more than 1,000 others. While the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has kept its distance, diplomatically, from the general for years, <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> himself has been scornful of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, telling <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> visitors that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> leaders should be more appreciative of a government that deposed a Marxist-led regime, an event virtually without precedent. Indeed, some American officials, citing <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>'s economic and foreign policies, believe long years of <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration hostility toward <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION> was misguided. As an example, with the exception of <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION> sided with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> on more <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> votes than any other Latin American country during the last General Assembly session. Among all Third World nations, only <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> were more supportive of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s positions. Beyond that, while other hemispheric countries are mired in economic crisis, <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION> boasted a healthy 5.4 percent growth rate last year, using market-oriented policies the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> advocates. And unlike many other hemispheric countries, <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION> pays its debts, allows foreign investors to remit profits and has been selling off state-run enterprises. Also winning sympathy for <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> among some officials is the presence of well-armed guerrilla groups which have staged repeated terrorist attacks over the years. But at a time when the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has been emphasizing democractic development in the hemisphere, the administration felt it could not make an exception by showing friendship toward <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>. The administration's attempts to promote democracy in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> would lose credibility if <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION> were exempted from this policy, officials contended, overriding those who favored greater recognition of the positive side of <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>'s rule. Beyond that, the Democratic majority in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, many of whom have bitter memories of the early years of the <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> regime, strongly oppose any accommodation with <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION>. Whatever gratitude <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> generated in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> for ousting President <PERSON> Salvador </PERSON> <PERSON> Allende </PERSON> in 1973 was short-lived because of way he dealt with those who opposed him. As outlined by <PERSON> Aryeh </PERSON> <PERSON> Neier </PERSON>, director of Americas Watch, a New York-based human rights group, there were a `` huge number'' of killings in <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION> during those early years. `` Nobody knows the actual count,'' he says. Some political activists disappeared without a trace and there were widespread allegations that political detainees were tortured. American alienation from <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION> was aggravated when <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> investigators blamed Chilean security agents for the 1976 car-bombing death in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> of a former top <PERSON> Allende </PERSON> aide, <PERSON> Orlando </PERSON> <PERSON> Letelier </PERSON>. This was one of the most notorious incidents of international terrorism ever to occur on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> soil. A decade ago, <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION> was a major target of the fresh emphasis on human rights introduced by President <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>. Nowadays, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> focus is on democracy in the hemisphere and, at long last, the prospect of the first genuine electoral test in <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION> since 1973 has induced hopes in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> that representative democracy may return to <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION>. Still, the long record of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> hostility toward <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> contrasts sharply with the friendship the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> demonstrated for years toward another Third World military strongman, President <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> <PERSON> ul-Haq </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, who was killed in a plane crash two weeks ago. The records of both <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> and Pinochet on human rights are similar. For <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, the difference is that <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> ruled a strategically important country and <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> does n't.

 A mild protest or two is not out of the ordinary at Sen. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s campaign appearances. Allegations that the senator pulled strings to get into the National Guard during the Vietnam War have prompted signs like `` War Wimp'' and `` Sissy Rich Boy'' to pop up here and there. But reporters who follow the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> vice presidential nominee have noticed that his hearing and vision are selective when it comes to such displays, as he proved Thursday at one stop in <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION>, home of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arkansas </ORGANIZATION>' Razorback Hogs. When <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> walked to his car for the next appearance, a voice from the crowd loudly shouted `` Chicken Hawk!'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, apparently not hearing the taunt correctly, smiled and gave a thumbs-up signal. `` Go Hogs!'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> shouted back.

 Sen. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> has taken to referring sarcastically to reporters as `` my newfound friends in the news media.'' But after two weeks on the campaign trail, he still had not met the reporters who covered him. Then, as <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s campaign plane flew Wednesday to <LOCATION> Baton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rouge </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> La. </LOCATION>, a particularly noisy group of photographers in the back of the plane started a chant, in parody of a daytime television game show announcer: `` Sen. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, come on down.'' Moments later, apparently by coincidence, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> came back to meet the press. The session was, of course, off the record.

<TEXT>
 There are campaign songs and campaign songs, but the one that was piped over the public address system on Sen. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s plane recently was loudly booed by an unappreciative audience of reporters. Sung by <PERSON> Sylvia </PERSON> <PERSON> Johns </PERSON>, the song, entitled `` <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s Song,'' had an unmemorable tune and this sampling of lyrics: `` From <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> to the White House Is where <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is gon na be Loyal to his country for American unity We the people of the <LOCATION> USA </LOCATION> Need a strong leader in the White House today It's <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> He's everybody's All American.'' The song was recorded in <LOCATION> Baton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rouge </LOCATION>, and complimentary 45 rpm copies were distributed to the press, courtesy of <ORGANIZATION> Bengal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, which the record jacket notes is a manufacturer of <ORGANIZATION> Bengal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Roach </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Spray </ORGANIZATION>.

 It was meant as a display of <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s youthful athleticism, but it took several tries for things to connect. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> helped the football team at <ORGANIZATION> Brandon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Jackson </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Miss. </LOCATION>, run a few scrimmage plays Thursday, taking the role of quarterback for himself. The first pass was badly underthrown. The second made it to the receiver, but glanced off his fingertips. On third down, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> called for a new receiver and sent him out for a 15-yard pass. That time, the two connected. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, whose first two weeks as the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> vice presidential career were about as rocky as his passing, acknowledged that his first pass was `` lousy.'' `` It's just like a campaign,'' he said. `` It's getting better and better.''

 The <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> paid $ 145,000 to settle claims by a former employee that she had been sexually harassed on the job, an <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman says. The payment was made late last month, with $ 112,500 going to the former employee and $ 32,500 to her attorney, <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> McCue </PERSON> said Thursday night. The <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> in today's editions identified the woman as <PERSON> Veronica </PERSON> <PERSON> Awkard </PERSON>. The payment came just months after a federal judge approved a settlement ordering a promotion, back pay and compensation for psychological counseling for <PERSON> Catherine </PERSON> <PERSON> Broderick </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> attorney who the judge said had been forced to work in a `` sexually hostile'' atmosphere at the agency's <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> regional office. Ms. <PERSON> McCue </PERSON>, who declined to discuss details of the most recent case, said the two cases were unrelated. The <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> said Awkard's allegations included reports of unwanted physical advances and verbal invitations for sexual liaisons. It said she left the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> in July 1983. The <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> said Ms. Awkard, then branch chief in the agency's Office of Applications and Report Services, filed a sexual harassment complaint in May 1983 Her complaint alleged `` the sexual harassment of me is a pattern and practice of treatment ... resulting in females being denied or awarded job benefits, including promotions, depending upon their acquiescence with the supervisors' or managers' sexual approaches.'' In June, District Judge <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pratt </PERSON> approved the settlement worked out by attorneys for the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Broderick </PERSON>. <PERSON> Pratt </PERSON> found that in addition to working in a sexually hostile environment, <PERSON> Broderick </PERSON> had been passed over for promotions and given a negative evaluation because she complained.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday night stayed a lower court ruling that had upheld contempt citations against four <LOCATION> Yonkers </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, city councilmen for fighting a federally ordered desegregation plan, a high court spokeswoman said. But in a related decision, the high court refused to stay a contempt ruling against the city. The court granted stays to council members <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Spallone </PERSON>, <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Longo </PERSON>, <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Fagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Chema </PERSON>, court spokeswoman <PERSON> Toni </PERSON> <PERSON> House </PERSON> said. `` The court has granted the stay for the four council members'' until they have had time to ask the court formally to fully review their cases, Ms. <PERSON> House </PERSON> said. `` The application so far as the city of <LOCATION> Yonkers </LOCATION> is concerned has been denied,'' she added. She said the entire court considered the applications, and Justices <PERSON> Thurgood </PERSON> <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> and <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON> filed a 12-page dissent. On Friday, a federal appeals panel upheld a judge's contempt finding but gave the councilmen and <LOCATION> Yonkers </LOCATION> a week to seek an emergency stay from the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> before reinstating the penalties. The council members had faced $ 500-a-day fines and jail, and the city could be hit with $ 1 million a day in penalties. In <LOCATION> Yonkers </LOCATION>, Mayor <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Wasicsko </PERSON> said early Friday, `` It seems at first curious that the fines would be stayed against the councilmen yet run against the city. It troubles me. The treasury of the city is going to be exposed and the taxpayers of the city are going to feel the burden. `` One thing it denies is the political martyrdom of the councilmen. They were slated to go to jail on Sunday. Their personal fines have ceased. But the city is going to plummet to bankruptcy. So their onus is their duty to the city. Their personal political martyrdom has been denied them.'' In <LOCATION> Albany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Conroy </PERSON>, a spokesman for Gov. <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON>, said, `` The governor will review the decision and confer with his council. We wo n't have a comment before then.'' Federal Judge <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> <PERSON> Sand </PERSON> had found them in contempt Aug. 2, the day after the council first rejected the court-ordered desegregation plan by a 4-3 vote. The council members have refused three times to change their votes on a zoning amendment needed to carry out a housing plan that the council had accepted last January. Sand ordered the plan to remedy what he determined in a 1985 ruling to have been 40 years of deliberate segregation in housing and education in the city. The plan calls for 200 low-income public housing units to be built in the predominantly white east side of <LOCATION> Yonkers </LOCATION>, with 800 moderate-income apartments to be built throughout the city.

The threat to Flight 333, bound for <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, was phoned into the airline's reservation center here Thursday and relayed to the control tower, said <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Mouradian </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the <ORGANIZATION> Wayne </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sheriff </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. After the DC-10 landed and its 255 passengers were evacuated, the plane was moved to an inactive runway, where explosive-sniffing dogs and the sheriff department's bomb squad searched it. No one was injured. <PERSON> Mouradian </PERSON> said she did n't know who made the threat or how much time elapsed between the flight's takeoff and return. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Gibbons </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <PERSON> Eagan </PERSON>, Minn.-based airline, said all information about the incident was being withheld. `` The airline has a standard reaction to bomb hoaxes.

 Nine million Japanese climbed down ladders, ran through smoke-filled tunnels and wheeled bedridden patients to safety as the country rehearsed for a massive earthquake that experts say could strike at any time. Thursday was the 65th anniversary of the <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kanto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Earthquake </LOCATION>, when a temblor estimated at 7.9 on the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale jolted the crowded plain surronding <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> and killed 140,000 people. Authorities hoping to hold down casualties in the event of another massive quake mobilized schoolchildren, civic groups and office workers for the tenth disaster prevention drill. Fire departments and officials from the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Land </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> and local governments coordinated evacuation scenarios in the aftermath of two imaginary temblors _ a second Great Kanto Earthquake of magnitude 7.9 and a jolt along the heavily populated, 170-mile <ORGANIZATION> Tokai </ORGANIZATION> belt linking <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nagoya </LOCATION> that would measure 8.0 on the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale. `` The number of participants does n't change much, but each year we've been getting better and better at holding the drill,'' said <PERSON> Takanori </PERSON> <PERSON> Kobiki </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Land </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>'s Disaster Prevention Operations. Scientists say <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> is likely to suffer a tremendous earthquake within the next 20 years. The <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on seismographs. An earthquake of 3.5 on the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale can cause slight damage in the local area, 4 moderate damage, 5 considerable damage, 6 severe damage. A 7 reading is a `` major'' earthquake, capable of widespread heavy damage; 8 is a `` great'' quake, capable of tremendous damage.

 The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Highway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Traffic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> says it will conduct research aimed at coming up with rules to protect the drivers of light vehicles from unreasonable risk of rollover. The <ORGANIZATION> NHTSA </ORGANIZATION> decision was announced Thursday in a case centering on the <ORGANIZATION> Suzuki </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Samurai </ORGANIZATION>, under attack from consumer groups for an alleged tendency to roll over in curves. The safety board rejected a petition by the Center for Auto Safety, a consumers group that wanted a recall of the Samurai, saying the Samurai is no more likely to roll than other comparable vehicles. The agency, however, approved a petition from the <ORGANIZATION> Consumers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> to study the light vehicle rollover problem in general. <PERSON> Suzuki </PERSON> responded to the decision by saying it showed that the allegations against the Samurai were unfounded. `` The federal government's action supports <PERSON> Suzuki </PERSON>'s claim that the Samurai is safe and should put to rest the inaccurate and misleading attacks on the vehicle,'' said a statement from the Japanese company's <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> subsidiary, <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Suzuki </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Brea </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>. About 169,000 Samurais have been sold in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Suzuki </PERSON> said The Center for Auto Safety, which is often at odds with automakers and their regulators, said the decision skirted the issue. `` If this were the law, then the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> would refuse to prosecute one mass murderer because there are other mass murderers,'' the center said, citing reports of 113 rollovers, 120 injuries and 25 deaths involving the Samurai. The center said it would ask <ORGANIZATION> NHTSA </ORGANIZATION> to reconsider its decision. <ORGANIZATION> NHTSA </ORGANIZATION> said it granted the <ORGANIZATION> Consumers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> petition because that request did not specify a single cause of Samurai rollovers and acknowledged that factors other than the stability of the vehicles lay behind some of the accidents. Many of the instances of rollover involving the Samurai happened when the driver had been drinking, was unfamiliar with the vehicle, or was attempting a risky maneuver, <ORGANIZATION> NHTSA </ORGANIZATION> said. <ORGANIZATION> NHTSA </ORGANIZATION> listed 10 research projects into vehicle stability it has completed or plans to complete, but said the research does not guarantee that new regulations will be issued. In rejecting the center's request for a Samurai recall, <ORGANIZATION> NHTSA </ORGANIZATION> said the Samurai's rollover rate, based on a study of 1986 - and 1987-model vehicles, was six per 100,000 vehicles It said the <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bronco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> II </ORGANIZATION>, by comparison, had a rollover rate of about 19 per 100,000 vehicles. The General Motors S-10 Blazer and S-15 <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> had rollover rates identical to the Samurai's. The Consumers Union in June urged a ban on the Samurai and, in its magazine Consumer Reports, rated the vehicle `` not acceptable,'' the first such rating given an automobile in 10 years. The ensuing publicity cut into Samurai sales and resulted in several lawsuits.

 <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> says he will stress voter registration, turnout and Democrat <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> as he travels around the country in the two months before the presidential election. `` I will campaign for voter registration and voter turnout in every state that I can get to,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said Thursday, denying reports some <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> aides had suggested he stay out of states where the former civil rights leader has a high negative rating. `` In some instances we'll speak directly for, as a surrogate for, the ticket,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said, while elsewhere he will be representing the party or his own Rainbow Coalition. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> for a meeting to plan voter registration strategy, told reporters he would focus hard on family farmers, unions and students because, `` I would hate to wake up on the morning of Nov. 9 -LRB- the day after the election -RRB- and hate to think that we lost by the lack of my work.'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and other <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> officials downplayed reports of continuing tension between the two camps, attributing any to the normal process involved in campaigns. But, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said, `` there's no lingering tension. `` There are always problems during a campaign ... but I have n't seen any evidence that a great divisiveness exists,'' said <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> adviser <PERSON> Bert </PERSON> <PERSON> Lance </PERSON>, the former federal budget director Thursday's meeting, attended by about 70 party workers and officials from around the Southeast, was called by <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Rainbow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION> to discuss voter registration <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> described the gathering as `` a very positive meeting, a very hopeful meeting.'' Those attending the meeting included <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> workers and strategists, mainly from the Southeast, <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Harrington </PERSON>, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' Southern political director, and state and national party officials <PERSON> Harrington </PERSON> said the party had made `` a significant and a successful effort'' to involve <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> supporters at all levels of the campaign. `` I do n't really think there's a serious problem, but if he -LRB- <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> -RRB- identifies some problems, then we'll work with him,'' <PERSON> Harrington </PERSON> said. Some of the attendees included Rep. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>, D-Ga.; <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> Assemblyman <PERSON> Willie </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s former campaign manager; <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> Gov <PERSON> Toney </PERSON> <PERSON> Anaya </PERSON>; <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Agriculture Commissioner <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Hightower </PERSON>; <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON>; <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> party executive director <PERSON> Bobby </PERSON> <PERSON> Kahn </PERSON>; and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' state campaign director, <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> deVegter </PERSON>.

Before Thursday's meeting in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Gardner </PERSON>, operations director in <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> office, said, `` Basically, the transition has been smooth. ... It's obviously not easy to integrate a campaign organization that was autonomous.'' <PERSON> Gardner </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> was among the states where the problems were most serious. He said the <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> camp `` had thought <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> was a model,'' but then the Rev. <PERSON> Cameron </PERSON> <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON>, a <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> backer, took his name off the list of nine co-chairs of the state <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign. <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> said the state <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> was giving only token attention to blacks.

 A mild earthquake hit <LOCATION> Nepal </LOCATION> today, 12 days after a strong quake that killed hundreds of people, but there were no reports of damage or casualties, scientists said. The quake registered 4.8 on the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale, according to seismologists. They said it was recorded at 3:45 a.m. They described the tremor as an aftershock of the 6.5 quake Aug. 21 that killed more than 1,000 people in <LOCATION> Nepal </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>. Like that quake, the epicenter of today's quake was in <LOCATION> Udayapur </LOCATION>, 20 miles north of the India-Nepal border. The <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on seismographs. An earthquake of 3.5 on the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale can cause slight damage in the local area, 4 moderate damage, 5 considerable damage, 6 severe damage.

<DATELINE>YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK, Wyo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Meteorologist <PERSON> Milo </PERSON> <PERSON> Radulovich </PERSON> crawls out of his pup tent each morning at 4 to see if the weather will bring any relief to firefighters working in the scorched pines of <LOCATION> Yellowstone </LOCATION>. But the prognosis, here and across much of the tinder-dry West, is bleak on the eve of Labor Day weekend after a drought-plagued summer that has produced the most devastating fires in the park's history `` We're dead in the water through the 10th of September,'' <PERSON> Radulovich </PERSON> said Thursday. He picked up a national weather chart and pointed toward the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION>. No major storms were in sight to bring moisture to the parched forests of <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>, and temperatures were expected to be above normal, perhaps in the 90s, for at least the next five days. The only bright spot: Calm winds were expected, which could limit the spread of flames. The weather outlook means more long days for firefighters battling six major blazes in <LOCATION> Yellowstone </LOCATION>, which have charred more than a half-million acres of the 2.2 million-acre park this summer. <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION> reopened its south gate Thursday for the first time in almost two weeks, meaning all five park gates were usable. All park roads also were open, though officials said worsening fire conditions could cause temporary closures. Elsewhere in the West, fires continued to burn woodland and brush in <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. Weather determines if a fire will crackle quietly along the forest floor or rage explosively through the tree tops. Forecasters like <PERSON> Radulovich </PERSON> try to keep firefighters a few steps ahead of Mother Nature. He is one of about 20 <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> forecasters who specialize in `` meso-meteorology'' _ the art and science of making pinpoint predictions based on broad-brush weather charts. `` We take those, together with observations in the field, and bring it down to the scale of 100,000 acres,'' he said. Based in <LOCATION> Sacramento </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Radulovich </PERSON>, 60, is assigned to western <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION>'s North Fork fire, which has burned more than 109,000 acres since it entered the park July 23. His early start each day gives him a chance to review the latest national weather map, which comes in via a small satellite dish next to his tent. His office, a few steps away, is the cab of a rental truck parked in the midst of a bustling firefighters camp at <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION>'s Madison Campground. <PERSON> Radulovich </PERSON> makes his predictions after checking instruments that monitor temperature, humidity, wind speed and direction. He and his assistant, <PERSON> Jeanne </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoadley </PERSON>, work closely with <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> fire management officer who compares weather conditions with what he knows about the forest's dryness. They brief firefighting officials at 6 a.m., then return to the van to prepare the next forecast. There may be two to four briefings a day, between which <PERSON> Radulovich </PERSON> and <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> squeeze in field trips to check local wind patterns, temperatures and other variables. Their day typically ends at about 11:30 p.m. <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION>'s fires are thriving on a steady diet of low humidity, high temperatures and forests baked dry by the area's worst recorded drought `` I've worked on fires for 21 years, and I've never seen things so dry,'' said <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>, who is based in western <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Lolo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION>. Fuel moisture, a measure of how much water the wood contains, has dropped at times to 3 percent in <LOCATION> Yellowstone </LOCATION> _ about the same as kiln-dried furniture, <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> said. Predicting the weather's effects in such a fire-prone area is tricky business. Canyons can funnel winds, accelerating them until they pump up a fire `` like a blacksmith's bellows,'' <PERSON> Radulovich </PERSON> said. Temperature inversions can make smoke hug the ground. <PERSON> Radulovich </PERSON> has been forecasting weather for forest fires since 1962 and is among the best at interpreting the quirky little kinks that can throw off predictions, <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> said. `` You have to be accurate or you do n't survive in this kind of forecasting,'' <PERSON> Radulovich </PERSON> said. Firefighters who work close to blazing timber take calculated risks based largely on what they think the wind may do. `` Their confidence in you is really important,'' <PERSON> Radulovich </PERSON> said. `` They make decisions of life and death.''

Swedish ships fired depth charges in the area Monday. <PERSON> Wessberg </PERSON> said it was impossible to seal off the fiord, but he said the navy increased patrols in the outlets of the three straits in the area in hopes of trapping any submarine that might be there. The navy previously has used nets to seal off waters suspected of harboring alien submarines. Foreign submarines have been reported in Swedish waters repeatedly for the last seven years. The government, citing lack of proof, has refused to name the country it believes is violating its territory. Experts have said tracks left on the ocean floor indicate the vessels were Soviet.

 Chinese and Soviet officials today said they found some common ground in just-concluded talks on <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> but achieved no breakthroughs in resolving the 10-year Cambodian conflict. `` I'm satisfied with the negotiations we've had,'' Soviet Vice Minister <PERSON> Igor </PERSON> <PERSON> Rogachev </PERSON> told reporters at the airport. `` We have now more common points, but that does not mean we have no points of difference.'' The Chinese deputy foreign minister, <PERSON> Tian </PERSON> <PERSON> Zengpei </PERSON>, said the talks, which ended Thursday, were `` beneficial in deepening the mutual understanding between the two countries on their positions on <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Rogachev </PERSON> and <PERSON> Tian </PERSON>, speaking to reporters at the airport before <PERSON> Rogachev </PERSON>'s departure for <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, both refused to go into detail about the differences. The five-day meeting in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> was the first time the two sides have met solely to discuss <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s 10-year occupation of <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>. Upon his arrival in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> on Sunday, <PERSON> Rogachev </PERSON> said he thought a breakthrough in resolving Chinese-Soviet differences on <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> was at hand. The Cambodian problem is the major barrier to normalization of relations between the two communist giants and to their first summit in 29 years. The nations severed relations in the early 1960s over strategic and ideological differences. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, the chief backer of the anti-Vietnamese resistance in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>, has called on the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, which supports <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, to pressure <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION> for an early and total withdrawal of its troops. <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> in May agreed to withdraw 50,000 troops by the end of this year and its remaining forces by 1990. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> has repeatedly expressed doubt over the sincerity of the Vietnamese promise, and <PERSON> Tian </PERSON> was skeptical about next year's pullout `` We will wait and see what they do,'' he said. According to <PERSON> Tian </PERSON>, the Soviets agreed `` in principle'' with <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s stand that a four-party coalition government, made up of the three resistance factions and the Hanoi-established government in <LOCATION> Phnom </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Penh </LOCATION>, should be set up following <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s withdrawal. <PERSON> Rogachev </PERSON> said only, `` We will approve the decision that will be taken by the -LRB- Cambodians -RRB- themselves. -LRB- They -RRB- must decide.'' <PERSON> Rogachev </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> Cambodian </LOCATION> issue will be taken up by the Soviet and <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> foreign ministers at a meeting in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> later this month. He added that another round of talks would be held next year, but a date and place have not been decided.

<TEXT>
 Nobel Prize-winner <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Alvarez </PERSON>, a brilliant, wide-ranging physicist who helped develop the atomic bomb and a controversial theory that asteroids or comets wiped out the dinosaurs, has died at age 77. <PERSON> Alvarez </PERSON> died at his home in this <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> college town late Wednesday after a long battle with cancer, it was announced Thursday. Colleagues described <PERSON> Alvarez </PERSON> as a scientific Renaissance man whose colorful career took him from wartime radar systems to UFO sightings, secrets of an Egyptian pyramid and an analysis of the assassination of President <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>. `` <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Alvarez </PERSON> was a stunningly creative individual,'' <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shirley </PERSON>, director of <ORGANIZATION> Lawrence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Berkeley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratory </ORGANIZATION>, said Thursday. `` His discoveries and inventions spanned an amazing range of the frontiers of man's knowledge over more than half a century.'' <PERSON> Alvarez </PERSON>, who worked at the laboratory and the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION>, died of complications from operations for esophageal cancer, laboratory spokeswoman <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Barberia </PERSON> said, quoting the physicist's widow, <PERSON> Janet </PERSON>. His health had declined since surgery for a benign brain tumor last fall, the spokeswoman said. <PERSON> Alvarez </PERSON> won the Nobel Prize in physics in 1968 for developing the liquid-hydrogen bubble chamber and for discovering numerous atomic particles with the device. The chamber is filled with a transparent liquid so that charged particles and their collisions can be studied by photographing the bubbles and boiling that occur along their paths. In the late 1970s, <PERSON> Alvarez </PERSON> made headlines with the theory that asteroids or comets striking the Earth 65 million years ago killed the dinosaurs by kicking up huge, dense clouds of dust and smoke. <PERSON> Alvarez </PERSON> and colleagues who developed the hypothesis, including his geologist son <PERSON> Walter </PERSON>, argued that the clouds blocked sunlight, lowering temperatures, destroying food plants, and resulting in the extinction of dinosaurs and many other species. The theory, which challenged the long-held view that dinosaurs were unsuited for survival in the Darwinian evolutionary scheme, triggered a bitter scientific debate that continues to this day. Others argue that volcanic eruptions killed the dinosaurs by darkening the sun. <PERSON> Alvarez </PERSON> labeled one critic `` a weak sister,'' and accused others of `` publishing scientific nonsense.'' His theory got a boost last week when new evidence from a study of ancient clay was reported in the British journal Nature. The hypothesis has a chilling modern-day counterpart: a theory that that an atomic war would produce enough smoke to plunge Earth into a cold, dark `` nuclear winter'' that would wipe out any survivors. <PERSON> Alvarez </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> native, was the son of <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Alvarez </PERSON>, a noted physician and medical columnist at the <ORGANIZATION> Mayo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Clinic </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Rochester </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minn </LOCATION>. He wrote in his 1987 autobiography, `` <PERSON> Alvarez </PERSON>, Adventures of a Physicist'' that he was indebted to his father, who told him it was a good idea to take a night off now and then to do nothing but think. As an undergraduate at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Alvarez </PERSON> built one of the first <PERSON> Geiger </PERSON> counters in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. As a graduate student, he used it to study cosmic rays and proved radiation from space consists mostly of protons. He began working at <LOCATION> Berkeley </LOCATION> in 1936. His discoveries included the capture of electrons by atomic nuclei and the radioactivity of tritium, an isotope of hydrogen used in thermonuclear weapons. During World War II, <PERSON> Alvarez </PERSON> invented an effective bomb sight and a number of radar systems. His invention of a ground-controlled approach landing system saved the lives of many Allied pilots, some of whom thanked him after the war, according to California-Berkeley. <PERSON> Alvarez </PERSON> played an important role in developing the atomic bomb, and invented several types of atom smashers. In his autobiography, he nostalgically recalled the early days of atomic research, when he held a sphere of radioactive plutonium in his hands, `` feeling its warmth.'' <PERSON> Alvarez </PERSON> made news by applying physics to popular subjects, including the X-ray scan of an Egyptian pyramid for hidden chambers _ there were none _ and analysis of evidence in the Kennedy assassination. His findings supported the <ORGANIZATION> Warren </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>'s conclusion that <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> <PERSON> Oswald </PERSON> was the lone assassin <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gardner </PERSON> said Thursday that he and the entire university community were saddened by the death of <PERSON> Alvarez </PERSON>, whom he called `` a creative and energetic scientist.'' <PERSON> Gardner </PERSON> said <PERSON> Alvarez </PERSON> showed `` concern for the student, commitment to meaningful and distinctive research, and devotion to the betterment of society. ` He will be missed.'' <PERSON> Alvarez </PERSON> is survived by his wife, <PERSON> Janet </PERSON>, two sons, two daughters, two sisters and a brother.

<TEXT>
 The dollar edged up marginally against the Japanese yen Friday, while share prices recovered nearly one-third of the losses of the previous day on the <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. The dollar, which opened at 136.25 yen, finished the week's trading at 136.75 yen, up 0.05 yen from Thursday's closing The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, the <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> stock market's main barometer, closed at 27,116.50, up 182.24 points or 0.67 percent from the previous session. Dealers attributed the stock market's recovery to the dollar-yen rate, which was seen as stabilizing after the dollar's steep rise the previous day. `` Investors were buying a little more than yesterday, but some investors are still cautious, waiting to see the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> report on the unemployment rate,'' said a stock dealer at a major securities firm in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, speaking on condition of anonymity. The Labor Department was to release national unemployment figures for August later Friday in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. The yen's recovery was attributed to the dollar's 0.20 yen decline overnight in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, but a dollar-buying drive remained strong among investors, leading the dollar to `` rise slowly but surely,'' according to a foreign exchange dealer at the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION>. `` Finance Minister <PERSON> Miyazawa </PERSON>'s comments on the yen-dollar rate -LRB- Thursday and Friday -RRB- have made investors stay away from the yen,'' he said, speaking on condition of anonymity. <PERSON> Miyazawa </PERSON> said Thursday that the yen's downswing was nothing to worry about, and after a news conference Friday morning said he saw no need to change <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s current monetary policy.

<HEAD>Grosz: Strikes Not The Correct Action to Express Demands</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-Poland, Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Premier <PERSON> Karoly </PERSON> <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON> said 300 miners who staged a rare strike in southern <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> had lawful demands, but he warned against other work stoppages. In a speech on Miners' Day, an annual fixture in the Soviet bloc, <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON> on Thursday shifted blame from his communist government to the management of the <PERSON> Komlo </PERSON> mine for failing to meet miners' grievances Workers at the <LOCATION> Komlo </LOCATION> mine, about 100 miles south of <LOCATION> Budapest </LOCATION>, went on strike Aug. 23. The miners complained that a personal income tax introduced in <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> on Jan. 1 sliced annual bonuses by 30 percent to 50 percent. The tax is part of <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON>'s efforts to curb an $ 18 billion foreign debt and stimulate the economy. Workers returned to the job after the government promised to try to resolve the problem over the tax. Officials said the strike, the first worker challenge to <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON>'s stringent eoconomic policies, was `` regrettable'' but understandable in view of economic hardships under a government austerity program `` For the non-payment of the full sum of bonuses due ... the responsibility'' belongs not to the government but `` on the local management which took a wrongly interpreted economic and political decision,'' <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON> said. `` We are looking into this question and will try to find a solution,'' the official <ORGANIZATION> MTI </ORGANIZATION> news agency quoted him as saying. <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON>, who told the meeting he was in favor of radical reforms to heal the ailing economy, criticized company managers of not `` economizing correctly on the funds available for dsitribution'' among the miners. But in a clear warning and in a bid to curb other potential strikes, <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON> said he did not believe `` threats would produce any results.'' `` I would contest that ... the stopping of work would provide the correct emphasis to express political demands ... as there are also those who believe that by using such methods they can acquire undue advantages,'' <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON> was quoted as saying. The strike coincided with labor unrest in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. Hundreds of Polish miners work in Hungarian shafts. But the official media did not say if any Poles were involved in the 20-hour stoppage at the <LOCATION> Komlo </LOCATION> mine. The mining industry in <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> has been crippled for at least 10 years due to producion lags, financial problems and a growing labor shortage. <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s official trade unions have been critical of recent economic policy, emphasizing that workers, retirees and the unemployed must be protected against inflation, already at 18 percent this year.

<HEAD>Band Of French Cars Cruise Into Beijing From Paris</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 With the flap of the French tricolor and the pop of champagne corks, 27 French automobiles cruised around Tiananmen Square today to celebrate the completion of the first Paris-to-Beijing car rally. The rally began July 12 in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> and covered more than 11,000 miles through 12 countries. The participants, 58 men and 10 women, from <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, crossed `` deserts, some rainy places, rivers, plateaus and many, many mountains to reach our goal,'' said <PERSON> Alain </PERSON> <PERSON> Lafeuillade </PERSON>, the trip's organizer. They also bumped into combat troops in <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> and braved the roads of <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, where `` the drivers are like a crazy Frenchman who's late for dinner,'' said <PERSON> Christophe </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Scheemaecker </PERSON>, a 23-year-old from <LOCATION> Antwerp </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION> The trip marks the first time that a car rally of this size has bridged <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Lafeuillade </PERSON> said. The last time such a feat was attempted was the 1931 Yellow Crusade of <ORGANIZATION> Citroen </ORGANIZATION>, which was abandoned after many of the cars broke down in mountainous <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>. The drivers rode out on camels. This time, driving the <ORGANIZATION> Renault </ORGANIZATION> 5 or the Peugoet 205, the roadsters averaged 10 hours a day behind the wheel for a total of about 600 hours each. `` A lot of the time we spent driving by ourselves, stopping in places that interested us and then catching up with the rest of the pack,'' <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Scheemaecker </PERSON> said. Once in <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>, after 17 hours straight behind the wheel, <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Scheemaecker </PERSON> lost control of the vehicle and it smashed into a mountainside. `` We thought we had to leave the race, but a mechanic flew in from <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION> and we were back on the road after a day,'' he said. In all, four of the original 31 cars did n't make it to <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, two dying in the mountains of <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> and two more falling victim to the Chinese deserts _ the <LOCATION> Gobi </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Taklamakan </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Karine </PERSON> <PERSON> Hervieu </PERSON>, a 21-year-old travel agent from <LOCATION> Brittany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, remembers an encounter with Iraqi troops 62 miles from the warfront with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. `` We gave them a message of peace,'' she said. `` For us, it was a very important moment.'' <PERSON> Babette </PERSON> <PERSON> Shily </PERSON>, 28, from <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, remembers leaving <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> and finding out that two days later President <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> <PERSON> ul-Haq </PERSON> had been killed. `` We always seemed just a day or two ahead of disaster,'' she said. `` It was the same in <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, too.'' Days after some of the cars left northern <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, an earthquake hit both <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nepal </LOCATION>, killing hundreds. `` We saw everything on this trip. Floods, droughts, soldiers,'' <PERSON> Shily </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Hervieu </PERSON> said most of the trip the drivers were allowed to go wherever they wanted, except in <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. `` We could understand <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> because they have a war and <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> was n't a problem because it was so brief,'' she said, `` but the <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> have gone too far with their control.'' <PERSON> Hervieu </PERSON> and others said the Chinese forced them to drive in a single line once they crossed into <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Kunjirap </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>. `` It's like one big parade, they wo n't let us break away,'' she said. The participants, aged 18 to 30, were all responsible for raising their own money for the trip, organizers said. `` They worked in banks, restaurants, whatever,'' <PERSON> Lafeuillade </PERSON> said. `` Then they'd get a garage to sponsor them and _ poof _ they'd be on the road.''

 A `` gung-ho'' <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> lieutenant accused of dereliction of duty in the drowning of a rescue-swimmer trainee was acquitted in the court-martial he sought in an effort to exonerate himself. `` All I can say is the military -LRB- justice -RRB- system worked,'' a smiling Lt. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Torchia </PERSON> said after the verdict Thursday night. `` The system that charged me found me innocent.'' A four-officer panel found the 32-year-old <ORGANIZATION> Princeton </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, man innocent of two counts of dereliction of duty after deliberating 3 -LCB- hours in the weeklong trial. <PERSON> Torchia </PERSON> was in charge of the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rescue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Swimmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> at the <LOCATION> Pensacola </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Naval </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Air </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Station </LOCATION> when <PERSON> Airman </PERSON> <PERSON> Recruit </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Mirecki </PERSON>, 19, of <LOCATION> Appleton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wis. </LOCATION>, died March 2 in a training pool. Instructors threw a panic-stricken <PERSON> Mirecki </PERSON> back into the pool after he climbed out and shouted that he wanted to quit the voluntary training, witnesses said. <PERSON> Mirecki </PERSON>, who had a phobia about being pulled under water, suffered a fear-induced heart attack before drowning, a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> pathologist testified in <PERSON> Torchia </PERSON>'s trial. A panel may be selected today for the court-martial of a second defendant, Petty Officer 2nd Class <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Combe </PERSON>, 28, of <LOCATION> Tempe </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ariz. </LOCATION>, who is accused of holding <PERSON> Mirecki </PERSON>'s head under water. He faces more serious charges of involuntary manslaughter, battery and conspiracy to commit battery. <PERSON> Torchia </PERSON> had been offered unspecified non-judicial punishment, but turned it down and sought the court-martial in an effort to clear his name. If convicted, he could have been fined two months pay, been reprimanded and lost seniority for promotion. The penalty would have put <PERSON> Torchia </PERSON>'s career on the line, said a defense lawyer, retired <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> Capt. <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> Salomon </PERSON>. <PERSON> Torchia </PERSON> said he plans to stay in the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>, and expects a new assignment soon as an aviation maintenance officer. <PERSON> Torchia </PERSON>, whom a prosecutor described as a `` gung-ho rescue swimmer,'' said he hoped the highly publicized <PERSON> Mirecki </PERSON> case had n't caused people to lose faith in <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> training, which he called the best in the world <PERSON> Torchia </PERSON> was acquitted largely because of the testimony of a prosecution witness, said one of his defense lawyers, retired <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> Capt. <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> Salomon </PERSON>. Lt. Cmdr. <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Matthews </PERSON>, a water survival and aerospace physiologist, testified for the prosecution Wednesday that brute force and high-stress tactics used at the school were unnecessary and counterproductive. In closing arguments, <PERSON> Salomon </PERSON> pointed out that <PERSON> Matthews </PERSON> and other training officers had been working for months since the drowning to correct problems plaguing the school long before <PERSON> Torchia </PERSON> took over. `` Yet Lt. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Torchia </PERSON>, an ordinary flight officer who is not a training expert and who had been on the job only 83 days is being branded a criminal for not figuring it all out,'' <PERSON> Salomon </PERSON> said. Testimony indicated several of <PERSON> Torchia </PERSON>'s superiors had visited the school, but that no one raised objections to procedures or questioned safety until after the death. In his closing argument, the lead prosecutor, Lt. Cmdr. <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Wynne </PERSON>, said <PERSON> Torchia </PERSON> should not have been excused by following long-established procedures. The defense's position was, `` If it had been that way before, it was OK,'' <PERSON> Wynne </PERSON> told the panel. `` Each man is responsible for his own watch,'' <PERSON> Wynne </PERSON> said, urging the panel to put aside any empathy they may have for a fellow officer and decide the case according to military law. After the verdict, prosecutors immediately left the courtroom and were unavailable for comment. Besides the two court-martial cases, the investigation also led to non-judicial punishment for five other <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> men, including a letter of reprimand to <PERSON> Torchia </PERSON>'s former boss, now-retired Capt. C.L. <PERSON> Lavinder </PERSON> who had headed the Naval Aviation Schools Command.

<HEAD>Measles Going Back Down For First Time In Four Years</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 After three years on the increase, measles is on its way down again, but health experts say it's too early to tell if the disease might finally be on the decline for good. The national <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday that 3,652 cases of the once-common childhood disease were reported in 1987, down 42 percent from the previous year. It's the first drop in measles reporting since the record low of 1,497 cases in 1983. Measles has fallen 99 percent since the era before measles vaccine was licensed in 1963, and the disease was thought headed for eradication when the record low came in 1983. But the case count then surprised researchers by going back up in 1984,'85 and'86. Researchers can not say just what the latest drop in measles really means, said Dr. <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> <PERSON> Hersh </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> measles specialist. The disease could continue to show `` little peaks and valleys'' for the next decade, he noted. `` We do n't really know,'' he said. `` We feel now that the vaccine is very good and very effective, but there are problems we are having _ in the people unvaccinated in the inner cities, and the vaccine failures in the school-age children.'' The <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> said 1,010 of the cases, or 28 percent, were theoretically preventable, occurring in people who should have been vaccinated, but were n't _ mostly preschool children in urban areas. Nearly three-fourths of the cases _ 2,642 _ were classified as non-preventable, occurring in patients who had been vaccinated but got measles anyway; most of those patients were older schoolchildren. `` We've got two fronts,'' <PERSON> Hersh </PERSON> said, `` the -LRB- young -RRB- kids in those preventable cases, and the vaccine failure in older children.'' The Atlanta-based agency said Thursday its expert consultants still believe the elimination of measles in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> `` should be pursued,'' but the two lingering problems _ the non-vaccinated and the vaccine failures _ will `` require different solutions.'' `` Increased efforts are needed to vaccinate preschool-aged children,'' particularly in inner-city areas, the <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> said in its weekly report. `` Innovative strategies are needed to increase immunization levels in these populations.'' Meanwhile, the <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> said, `` aggressive revaccination strategies'' may be needed during measles outbreaks to eliminate the so-called non-preventable cases in already-vaccinated children. Such a revaccination would involve a rapid program of additional shots for most children vaccinated before 1980, when new vaccination recommendations and new vaccine techniques began to improve the protection somewhat, <PERSON> Hersh </PERSON> said. Twenty-nine percent of last year's cases occurred among patients under 5; another 29 percent occurred in the 15-19 age group. Researchers have reports on how two-thirds of the patients got the measles; 53 percent of them acquired the disease in primary and secondary schools, while others picked it up in day care, universities, at home or in other settings. Three-fourths of the cases _ 2,759 _ were reported from eight locations: <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, 469 cases; <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, 809; <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, 452; <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, 318; <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, 213; <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>, 190; <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>, 162; and <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>, 146. Fewer than 9 percent of the nation's counties reported measles cases.

 If the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> wants to pace the cuts in their nuclear arsenals they should halt production of a key component of nuclear weapons, according to a group of arms control specialists.

 A 200-pound gorilla made an `` impossible'' escape from its enclosure at the <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> Zoo by scaling a wall, forcing the evacuation of about 200 people, authorities said. The 13-year-old gorilla, named <PERSON> Molly </PERSON>, climbed the wall, clambered onto a roof and then jumped down to walk into the ape house entrance normally used by humans. At the time, there were no people nearby, said zoo Director <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Waterhouse </PERSON>. The zoo was closed for about 1 -LCB- hours and about 200 people evacuated as workers dealt with the gorilla. Workers at the zoo locked the ape house doors and blocked them with trucks and closed other openings with plywood. The gorilla was then tranquilized. `` It still appears to be impossible,'' Waterhouse said about the escape. `` She is extremely athletic.'' Earlier in the summer she propped a skinny tree branch in the corner of her outdoor exhibit and climbed to another brief spell of freedom.

<HEAD>Most Vietnam Vets Escaped Heavy Exposure to Dioxin, Study Suggests</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRENDA C. COLEMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A veterans group criticized a new report by the <ORGANIZATION> federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> that suggests most <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> GIs escaped heavy exposure to the poison dioxin, unless they handled the herbicide Agent Orange. `` This study seems to be pretty much the same data that was released a year ago, only a year ago it was portrayed rather differently,'' said <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Kasinitz </PERSON>, a spokesman for the 35,000-member <ORGANIZATION> Vietnam </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Veterans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> last year concluded that exposure to dioxin could not be determined using military records of troop locations and spraying of Agent Orange, which contained the deadly poison. `` Now ... they are jumping to the conclusion that very few people were exposed,'' <PERSON> Kasinitz </PERSON> said Thursday in a telephone interview from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. `` That was a bit of a jump in logic that does n't seem to be substantiated.'' The <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION>'s new report, in today's Journal of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, describes a comparison of blood tests between 646 <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> veterans and 97 non-Vietnam veterans. `` Current TCDD -LRB- dioxin -RRB- levels were nearly identical in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> and non-Vietnam veterans,'' the researchers said. The latest study deliberately drew <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> veterans from battalions that had served in areas most heavily sprayed with Agent Orange around <LOCATION> Saigon </LOCATION> in 1967 and 1968, the <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> said. Only two <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> veterans, or 0.3 percent of all 646 tested, had blood dioxin levels greater than 20 parts per trillion, considered `` clearly elevated,'' the researchers said. `` These two men each reported their health status as ` excellent' and did not attribute any health problems to Agent Orange exposure,'' the researchers added The two men were not among the 14 percent of the <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> veterans in the study group who did link health problems to exposure. `` This study is consistent with other studies and suggests that most <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> ground troops who served in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> were not heavily exposed to <ORGANIZATION> TCDD </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- dioxin -RRB-, except perhaps men whose job involved handling herbicides,'' the researchers said. But <PERSON> Kasinitz </PERSON> said the new report gives the `` unfortunate'' impression that small exposures to dioxin were harmless, which has not been proven, `` and that there is no need for the government to act to assist those that have been harmed.'' Dioxin stays in the bloodstream for many years, and high levels of the chemical can be measured with blood tests as long as two decades after someone has been exposed, the researchers said. Agent Orange was used as a defoliant in <LOCATION> Southeast </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> during the 1960s by the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military. Some <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> veterans contend it has caused them such health problems as cancer, immune system disorders and birth defects in their children. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> just two months ago cleared the last legal obstacle to a multimillion-dollar settlement that could benefit up to 250,000 <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> veterans in a class-action lawsuit against the seven manufacturers of Agent Orange. But scientists are still trying to settle a continuing controversy over exactly what health effects the dioxin in Agent Orange may have. Dioxin is known to be one of the most powerful causes of cancer in laboratory animals ever tested. It has not been shown to cause cancer in humans, but the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> classifies it as a probable carcinogen.

<TEXT>
 A swollen tributary of the <LOCATION> Ganges </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> in the capital today reached its highest level in 34 years, officials said, as soldiers and volunteers worked to build dams against the rising waters. At least 64 people died nationwide since Thursday, bringing to 748 the nationwide death toll from floods that began with the monsoon rains in June, newspapers reported today. The flood waters swept away children, sank boats, and leveled houses, newspapers reported. Scores of people died after being bitten by snakes that had crawled to higher ground, they said. No deaths were reported in <LOCATION> Dhaka </LOCATION>, where flood waters ranged from several inches downtown to 6 feet on the outskirts. Hundreds of thousands of people left their water-logged houses in <LOCATION> Dhaka </LOCATION>, many moving in with relatives or into government shelters. Highways and rail lines remained under water, while drinking water supplies were cut off in 12 outlying districts of <LOCATION> Dhaka </LOCATION> because the pumps were submerged, according to city officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity. By this morning, the <LOCATION> Buriganga </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> was nearly 3 inches above flood stage _ its highest level in 34 years, said the Flood Forecast and Warning Center. It predicted the river would rise another 8 inches by nightfall. Some low-income city residents have started hoarding food, but there were few other signs of panic, officials said. `` There is no shortage of food right now, but the water is making transportation virtually impossible,'' President <PERSON> Hussain </PERSON> <PERSON> Muhammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Ershad </PERSON> told reporters Thursday. As the river threatened to engulf the city, the army and volunteers shored up a dam along the 10-mile road leading from <LOCATION> Dhaka </LOCATION> to the town of <LOCATION> Narayanganj </LOCATION>. Students from <ORGANIZATION> Dhaka </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, which shut down until Sept. 15, joined the relief effort. At <LOCATION> Dhaka </LOCATION> airport, foreign airlines were advised to delay flights today because a part of the main runway was covered with 1 to 2 inches of water, said an airport official. Smaller domestic planes used a short, dry part of the strip to take off and land, said the official, speaking on condition of anonymity. There has been little rain in <LOCATION> Dhaka </LOCATION> in the past week, but the <LOCATION> Buriganga </LOCATION> rose quickly as flood waters from the north of the country surged south. A ferry with about 700 people aboard sank Wednesday night at the dock in <LOCATION> Chandpur </LOCATION>, about 40 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Dhaka </LOCATION>, and five people were missing and feared dead, police in <LOCATION> Chandpur </LOCATION> said. Salvage workers entered the ferry Friday and found no bodies, the police said. In 1987, more than 1,500 people died in the annual monsoon floods. In 1985 more than 10,000 were killed when cyclones and tidal waves hit islands in the <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bengal </LOCATION>, about 130 miles south of <LOCATION> Dhaka </LOCATION>.

 Airboats fanned out over <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Okeechobee </LOCATION> for the first statewide alligator hunt in 26 years, a 30-day reprieve aimed at thinning out the once endangered species whose thick hides fetch $ 42 a foot. `` We could have filled our 15-gator limit tonight,'' <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> <PERSON> Schafer </PERSON> boasted about four hours after the hunting season opened Thursday night. He displayed his prey: three gators ranging from seven to 10 feet long. `` It was n't as hard as other animals I've hunted,'' said <PERSON> Schafer </PERSON>, 45, of <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, a veteran big-game hunter. Across <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> starting at sundown, more than 200 hunters selected by the state began to search for their red-eyed prey with flashlights and head lamps. Harpoons, snares and bows and arrows are about the only weapons permitted. Most alligators are taken alive, their jaws secured with duct tape, and are delivered to processing plants still kicking. Some are killed with a `` bang-stick,'' a device that shoots a cartridge on impact. Guns are prohibited because the gators often sink after being shot. On <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Okeechobee </LOCATION>, hunters, reporters and a few sightseers departed under the din of airboats and through a mist churned up by their large propellers. Bugs fluttered about like snowflakes in the hunters' lights. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Alpern </PERSON>, 25, a free-lance writer from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, said to be the only Northerner who received a permit, was still searching for his first alligator at midnight with the aid of a professional trapper. `` Who knows?'' he said. `` Maybe I wo n't even be able to kill it once we find one.'' But <PERSON> Alpern </PERSON>, like many hunters, could n't ignore the profitable side of the hunt. In addition to the lucrative hides, gator meat sells for up to $ 6 a pound. `` The money is the big factor,'' said <PERSON> Rodney </PERSON> <PERSON> Crawford </PERSON>, a 19-year-old cook from <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION>, who will hunt on <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> George </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. State game officers are closely monitoring the hunt for poachers and permit-holders using illegal weapons or taking gators below the 4-foot minimum length. Since federal anti-poaching methods were adopted in 1970, the alligator population in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> has about doubled to an estimated 1 million. Nearly 1,000 gators have been captured in experimental hunts since 1981, and the September season will be isolated to 28 districts where the alligator population is extraordinarily high. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Stice </PERSON>, a biologist with the state Game and <ORGANIZATION> Fresh </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Water </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, said a cross section of the public was sought for the hunt to expand interest in alligators. The 238 hunters, selected from about 5,000 applications, attended a six-hour, state-sponsored training session and signed liability waivers. <PERSON> Stice </PERSON> estimated the hunters will capture 65 to 70 percent of the possible maximum of 3,450. For state wildlife officials, the hunt follows a nearly 20-year effort to preserve the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> alligator, which averages about 10 feet in length. The last state-approved hunt for sport was in 1962, when the American alligator was declared endangered and hunting alligators in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> was banned. As its numbers increased, however, officials downgraded the alligator from endangered to threatened and the state gradually relaxed hunting restrictions. `` People are getting gator phobia,'' said <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Kramer </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Delray </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, who captures nuisance alligators for the state. `` I got a call the other day in <LOCATION> Boca </LOCATION> -LRB- <LOCATION> Raton </LOCATION> -RRB- and it turned out to be an inflatable pool alligator that blew into a ditch.'' <PERSON> Allan </PERSON> <PERSON> Woodward </PERSON>, head of alligator research for the game commission, theorized that the alligator population was not as decimated as previously thought during the height of poaching in the 1960s. `` They've really surprised us,'' he said. `` They're a pretty hardy animal.''

<HEAD>Whitworth Espionage Convictions, Sentence Affirmed</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A federal appeals court upheld the espionage convictions and 365-year prison sentence of ex-Navy radioman <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Whitworth </PERSON>, a member of the Walker spy ring that passed military secrets to the Soviets. The 9th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> ruled 3-0 Thursday that the punishment fit <PERSON> Whitworth </PERSON>'s crime of selling ultra-sensitive <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> decoding and communications information to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. The sentence imposed by U.S. District Judge <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Vukasin </PERSON> `` viewed in the abstract ... would appear harsh,'' the court said. `` This sentence, however, is not disproportionate to <PERSON> Whitworth </PERSON>'s crimes. <PERSON> Whitworth </PERSON>, 49, of <LOCATION> Davis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, a radioman with a top-secret clearance for much of his 18-year <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> career, was convicted in 1986 of seven counts of espionage for supplying ultra-sensitive decoding and communications information to spymaster <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> for nearly a decade, in exchange for $ 332,000. <PERSON> Vukasin </PERSON> called <PERSON> Whitworth </PERSON> `` one of the most spectacular spies of the century'' and imposed the nation's harshest sentence for espionage since <PERSON> Julius </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ethel </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosenberg </PERSON>, convicted of conspiring to furnish atomic bomb secrets to the Soviets, were electrocuted in 1953. <PERSON> Whitworth </PERSON>'s sentence forbids parole consideration for 60 years. In the decision, the court rejected defense arguments that a sentence longer than <PERSON> Walker </PERSON>'s amounted to cruel and unusual punishment. Military and intelligence officials testified at the trial that the spy ring had revealed the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s most precious secrets and caused damage that may be impossible to calculate. <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> also recruited his son and brother as members of the spy ring. He pleaded guilty in a <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION> federal court to spying for the Soviets for 17 years and was sentenced to life in prison, with parole possible in 10 years. The opinion by Judge <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Boochever </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Constitution does not require a judge in one court to compare a defendant's relative guilt to that of a defendant in another court on separate charges before imposing sentence Even if comparison of guilt was required, <PERSON> Boochever </PERSON> said, `` the court notes that <PERSON> Whitworth </PERSON> kept <PERSON> Walker </PERSON>'s espionage operation alive for nearly a decade and himself became a central figure because of his access to highly classified material.'' <PERSON> Whitworth </PERSON>'s chief prosecutor, former Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Farmer </PERSON>, commented, `` The sentence was not harsh at all. If this had been a case where there was a death penalty available, it clearly would have been prosecuted as a capital case.'' Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Sanford </PERSON> <PERSON> Svetcov </PERSON>, who represented the prosecution on appeal, agreed that <PERSON> Whitworth </PERSON> deserved a death sentence, which was abolished for espionage and other federal crimes by a 1972 <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruling. `` It's a sickness in our society, that we have people willing to do harm to their own country for money,'' <PERSON> Svetcov </PERSON> said. `` These guys were not Communists by any means. They were strictly in it for profit.'' <PERSON> Whitworth </PERSON>'s lawyer on appeal, <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Caplan </PERSON>, said he was disappointed by the ruling and would appeal. He said he was `` astounded'' by the court's conclusion that the verdict was not influenced when <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> was improperly allowed to speculate on the witness stand that <PERSON> Whitworth </PERSON> must have known the secrets were being delivered to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Walker </PERSON>, also a former <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> radioman with a top-secret clearance, testified that he had started selling secrets to a Soviet agent in 1968 and recruited <PERSON> Whitworth </PERSON> as his chief supplier of classified materials in 1974, after <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> himself no longer had direct access to the material. <PERSON> Whitworth </PERSON> was convicted of furnishing to <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> the secrets of <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> decoding equipment, code keys and communications systems that <PERSON> Whitworth </PERSON> gathered and photographed for nearly a decade as a highly placed radio officer at ship and shore stations.

 The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> has refused to halt mounting daily fines against the city for blocking a federal housing desegregation plan, a decision the mayor says could cause <LOCATION> Yonkers </LOCATION> `` to plummet to bankruptcy.'' But in a ruling issued Thursday night, the court temporarily spared the four city councilmen who oppose the plan from going to jail until they have time to ask formally that their cases be fully reviewed, <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Toni </PERSON> <PERSON> House </PERSON> said. The justices stayed a lower court ruling that had upheld contempt citations against the four councilmen, who had faced a resumption of $ 500-a-day fines and the start of jail terms this weekend. The city's fines for failing to comply with the desegregation order were put on hold until today, pending the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>'s ruling The fines will now resume against the city, <LOCATION> Yonkers </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Wasicsko </PERSON> said. The fines started Aug. 2 at $ 100 and doubled daily. The city had paid $ 12,700 before receiving its first stay from an appeals court, which upheld the contempt finding last Friday but granted an additional one-week stay. It also capped the city's fines at $ 1 million a day. House said the entire court considered the applications from the councilmen and the city, and `` the application so far as the city of <LOCATION> Yonkers </LOCATION> is concerned has been denied.'' Justices <PERSON> Thurgood </PERSON> <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> and <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON> filed a 12-page dissent, arguing that all stays be denied, she said. `` As the city repeatedly points out in its application, ` <LOCATION> Yonkers </LOCATION> is relatively unique in that most of the governmental power in the city is centralized in the legislative branch.' For this reason the city IS the council,'' <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> wrote. The ruling surprised <PERSON> Wasicsko </PERSON>, who favors compliance with the desegregation order. `` It troubles me,'' he said early today. `` The treasury of the city is going to be exposed and the taxpayers of the city are going to feel the burden. `` One thing it denies is the political martyrdom of the councilmen. They were slated to go to jail on Sunday. Their personal fines have ceased. But the city is going to plummet to bankruptcy. `` So their onus is their duty to the city,'' he added. `` Their personal political martyrdom has been denied them.'' Two of the four defiant councilmen _ <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Longo </PERSON> and Vice Mayor <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Spallone </PERSON> _ said early today that the decision, for them, was a major victory. `` This country went through a revolution a couple hundred years ago to make sure that people could cast their votes independently and without coercion,'' <PERSON> Longo </PERSON> said. Councilman <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Chema </PERSON>, another one of the four, called the decision `` a big personal victory, but I have serious concerns about the city. It's kind of like being administered oxygen while someone strangles you.'' The fourth councilman, <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Fagan </PERSON>, called the decision `` unexpected'' and declined to comment further. <PERSON> Longo </PERSON> said the four would ask <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> <PERSON> Sand </PERSON>, who initially found them in contempt, to suspend the city's fines pending their <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> hearing, which <PERSON> Longo </PERSON> said would not be until 1989. `` The relief becomes moot if he decides to bankrupt the city in the interim,'' <PERSON> Longo </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Longo </PERSON> and <PERSON> Spallone </PERSON> refused to say if they would allow the city to go bankrupt rather than change their votes. In 1985, Sand found the city liable for 40 years of segregating housing and schools and ordered the city to build 800 units of moderate-income housing throughout the city. Sand found them in contempt Aug. 2, the day after the council first rejected the court-ordered desegregation plan by a 4-3 vote. They've rejected the plan by the same vote three times since. <PERSON> Bertran </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wallace </PERSON>, president of the <LOCATION> Yonkers </LOCATION> branch of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Colored </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION>, one of the plaintiffs in the original suit against the city, said this morning he was not very familiar with the ruling. `` Our greatest concern is to see that the court order issued by Judge Sand is carried out and implemented and that we build the homes ... in a very peaceful and orderly manner,'' he said. The state <ORGANIZATION> Emergency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, which has taken control of the city's spending, had said it would seek criminal charges against the four councilmen today if the fines are reimposed. Spokespeople said this morning that Gov. <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> and Secretary of State <PERSON> Gail </PERSON> <PERSON> Shaffer </PERSON>, who chairs the control board, would not comment until they had seen the high court's ruling. The criminal charges stem from violating the control board act _ a state law _ by jeopardizing the city's finances through spending money the city they were not authorized to spend. <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Condon </PERSON>, spokesman for a citizens' group called COMPLY, which supports compliance with the desegregation order, said `` the ruling is one final indication that the city needs to face reality and get on with putting its life back together.'' The city and councilmen had a tentative court appearance with Sand set for 2 p.m. today. It was not known how the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruling would affect the schedule.

<HEAD>Carlucci: Congress Must Help Reform Procurement Process</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JENNIFER BRANDLON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BALTIMORE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> warned <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> not to act hastily to change the way it reviews defense spending in the wake of a major fraud probe involving defense contractors and consultants. Lawmakers should not adopt reform proposals being circulated on Capitol Hill, including creation of an independent acquisition agency, removing the inspector general from the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> and locking the `` revolving door'' between the <ORGANIZATION> DOD </ORGANIZATION> and defense contractors, <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> said on Thursday. `` Certainly, we want to see those found guilty of wrongdoing punished, and punished severely, for their actions ... but reform is really about prevention, not punishment,'' <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> said. The speech before the <ORGANIZATION> Baltimore </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> on Foreign Affairs was the most comprehensive statement to date by the secretary since revelations of a widespread investigation of alleged fraud involving defense contractors and consultants. In his `` prescription for procurement reform,'' <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> called on <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to simplify its budget-making process, reduce the number of committees that oversee defense spending, shift the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> budget to a two-year cycle and provide multi-year funding for more weapon programs. The goal should be to limit the number of `` intervention points where a skillful lobbyist can succeed'' in gaining an advantage, he said. `` Right now, the defense budget bill must complete a 17-step process to final passage,'' <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> said. `` Each point along the way is an opportunity for those bent on exerting improper influence.'' <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> must seek ways `` to reduce the profusion of intervention points on -LRB- <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> -RRB- that invite improper _ if not always strictly illegal _ behavior,'' he said. However, Rep. <PERSON> Les </PERSON> <PERSON> Aspin </PERSON>, D-Wis., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said the speech failed to address central issues of procurement `` Since the procurement scandal erupted, we have seen people selling old ideas that have nothing to do with the procurement problem,'' <PERSON> Aspin </PERSON> said. `` They are pet rocks dressed up as solutions to the scandal. But they are still pet rocks. I am afraid Secretary <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> has fallen into the same trap in his speech billed ` prescription for procurement reform. `` His proposal dealt with budget reform, not procurement reform. His suggestions say nothing about the use of consultants, the abuse of insider information, or restoration of the integrity of the bidding process,'' the congressman said. `` Many of his suggestions for budget reform are valid and have been pushed by me and others over the years. But they have nothing to do with procurement reform,'' <PERSON> Aspin </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> investigation, which became public in June, centers on allegations that defense contractors routinely used outside consultants to obtain proprietary information on the bids of competitors, and that the consultants may have paid bribes to <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> employees. <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> warned against a `` legislative rush'' to enact reforms without considering their effects. `` At the very least, <ORGANIZATION> DOD </ORGANIZATION>'s critics owe us a hearing before they try to pass legislation that could impact our procurement process and the defense industrial base for years to come,'' he said. `` We need to ask: How does the system as it exists today offer wrongdoers the opportunity to act _ and how can we close these windows of vulnerability in the procurement process?'' <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> said establishment of an independent acquisition agency by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> would erect barriers between the acquisition process and those in the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> who know best what weapons they need. Likewise, the defense department relies on the `` revolving door'' that brings experts from the industry into government, <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> said. `` We need to police the system for abuses, not penalize procurement professionals for seeking to build on and benefit from their expertise,'' he said. As for the suggestion that the inspector general should be removed from the <ORGANIZATION> DOD </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> said it would `` deprive the secretary of defense of the eyes and ears that help him monitor the system he is charged with supervising.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> already has acted to prevent contractors from winning contracts unfairly by streamlining its own acquisitions chain of command, <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION> no longer will let convicted drug dealers take part in a house arrest program under which <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Zaccaro </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> is spending his four-month cocaine trafficking term in a $ 1,500-a-month luxury apartment. `` Hallelujah!'' said <LOCATION> Addison </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Quinn </PERSON> upon learning of Gov. <PERSON> Madeleine </PERSON> <PERSON> Kunin </PERSON>'s announcement Thursday. `` I never considered that drug dealers were non-violent offenders. I never thought they should be in the house arrest program no matter who they are,'' said <PERSON> Quinn </PERSON>, who prosecuted <PERSON> Zaccaro </PERSON> and opposed his entry into the program. The changes do not apply to those already in the house arrest program, including <PERSON> Zaccaro </PERSON>, the 24-year-old son of former vice presidential candidate <PERSON> Geraldine </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferraro </PERSON>. <PERSON> Kunin </PERSON>'s announcement followed public outcry over the disclosure that <PERSON> Zaccaro </PERSON> was living in the maid-service apartment while in the program. The house arrest program allows non-violent criminals to find and pay for their own housing and spend their sentence outside of prison while under strict supervision. <PERSON> Zaccaro </PERSON> was convicted in April of selling $ 25 worth of cocaine to an undercover police officer. He was sentenced to four months in prison, but spent only 29 minutes in the <ORGANIZATION> Chittenden </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Correctional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in July before moving to the <LOCATION> Montpelier </LOCATION> apartment. <PERSON> Kunin </PERSON> defended the program overall, saying it provided the necessary element of punishment and helped to reduce overcrowding in <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION>'s prisons. However, she said, the program must exclude drug dealers. `` We must have confidence, public confidence in the system,'' she said. `` I also feel that we have to send a very strong message in terms of drug offenders.'' Under the changes, program participants also must spend at least 24 hours in traditional incarceration before moving to their house-arrest residences. <PERSON> Kunin </PERSON> said many assumptions about drug offenses have changed since the original program guidelines were drafted in 1983. `` Instead of considering this to be a low to moderate offense as it had been in the past, it should be moved up because I think anyone who sells drugs anywhere in the world, in this country, in the state of <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION>, is a serious offender,'' <PERSON> Kunin </PERSON> said. Corrections Commissioner <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Patrissi </PERSON>, however, told <PERSON> Kunin </PERSON> that a review of similar house arrest programs in eight other states found none barred drug offenders.

<TEXT>
 While many other 18-year-olds are thinking about college courses, <PERSON> Alonzo </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Haney </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> is thinking about windshield wipers and the idea of becoming a millionaire. <PERSON> Haney </PERSON> invented a windshield wiper that already has caught the eye of <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. He also has his own company, <ORGANIZATION> HMI </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, which he says is backed by more than $ 1 million in investments. Not bad for a teen-ager who earned `` C's'' in high school science. <PERSON> Haney </PERSON>, who goes by the nickname Chip, puts himself in some respectable company _ with inventors like <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Edison </PERSON>. `` They're inspirational, they defy odds and I guess that's what I am doing right now,'' he said in an interview Thursday at his company's spacious <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> office. `` When I look out this window, I think a lot about what space of the sky I want to go after next,'' said the youth, who lives in the suburb of <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. His path to fortune began simply. He was driving his car to pick up his mother from work one rainy day in October 1986 when he noticed the windshield wipers did n't work well. `` I took out a pad of paper and a pen and I started to sketch out new ideas of a better wiper blade,'' <PERSON> Haney </PERSON> recalled. That night, the made the first prototype out of a garden hose at home. <PERSON> Haney </PERSON> says his wiper can scoop rain, ice and snow off a windshield and toss the debris as far as four feet. It is specially designed to hug the windshield more closely than traditional wipers, he said. When he found out he would have to pay about $ 10,000 to hire an attorney to file a patent application, <PERSON> Haney </PERSON> decided to do the research and application himself. His patent was approved, and <PERSON> Haney </PERSON> marched into <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION>'s executive offices in <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> the day after he graduated from high school last year to persuade the giant automaker to use his wiper on <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> cars. Company officials have promised to test it. <PERSON> Haney </PERSON> is putting the final touches on a contract with <ORGANIZATION> Alofs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Grand </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rapids </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>, which will make and distribute his invention. `` We're hoping to have it -LRB- the contract -RRB- complete and signed next week,'' said <PERSON> Alofs </PERSON> owner <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> DeFouw </PERSON>. <PERSON> DeFouw </PERSON> said <PERSON> Haney </PERSON>'s earnings would be based on the number of wipers sold. In addition to <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION>, he said, a few Japanese automakers have expressed interest. Meanwhile, he has invented 28 other products, five of which have patents pending, he said. `` I spend about 18 hours a day thinking about what I want to make,'' <PERSON> Haney </PERSON> said. `` I do n't date, I do n't have time for that right now.'' In his office hang two paintings, which <PERSON> Haney </PERSON> said tell a lot about what motivates him. One depicts a young black man, shirtless and hunched over, struggling to be taken seriously. `` Now I can be accepted as an equal, but 40 years ago, you would n't have found me in this office,'' said <PERSON> Haney </PERSON>, who is black. Another painting is of a man playing polo. `` I love polo because it's very challenging and not everyone can do it _ just like not everyone can be 18 and own a company,'' <PERSON> Haney </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stephenitch </PERSON>, who taught <PERSON> Haney </PERSON> in business classes at <ORGANIZATION> Warren </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Township </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in suburban <PERSON> Gurnee </PERSON>, said the youth `` has a scary grasp of business.'' <PERSON> Haney </PERSON>'s mother <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON>, 43, also is proud of her son. `` But it does worry me that he's not with his own age group,'' she said. `` He is missing out on a lot and I hope later on, after he makes his fortune, he does n't regret it.''

<HEAD>Radical Students Demonstrate Against Olympics; Roh Plans To Free
Dissidents</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL SHIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 About 300 students protested today to demand that the Olympics be shared with communist <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, and they claimed the Games were being used to increase dictatorial rule. Officials said that President <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> Tae-woo plans to release dissidents from prison after the Olympics. Students from several colleges in the <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> area took part in the rally at <ORGANIZATION> Hongik </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> and said they would `` not sit idle'' during the Olympics. But they did not say if they would attempt to disrupt the Games. `` We oppose the Olympics, which only help dictator <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> Tae-woo,'' the students shouted. Government officials are concerned radicals may stage protests during the Sept. 17-Oct. 2 event The radicals have little public support and have been strongly criticized by many Koreans in recent weeks for staging violent demonstrations. The one-hour rally and short march today were peaceful. Dozens of students took up positions in front of the school for possible clashes with police, but riot police stayed away. The students shouted slogans supporting <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s demand to be a co-host at the Games. `` Let's advance national unification by co-hosting the Olympics!'' the students chanted. <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> has said it will boycott the Olympics unless it is allowed to be a co-host. The International Olympic Committee said the Games can not be shared because they are awarded to a single city. Radical students, a small but powerful minority on campuses, are seeking to topple the <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> government. They have become increasingly pro-leftist as they have lost support among most students and other Koreans following broad democratic reforms by the government. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> have been bitter rivals since the peninsula was divided at the end of World War II. They fought the Korean War of 1950-53 that left more than 1 million people dead. Government party officials said <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> made the agreement to free political prisoners during political talks with party chairman <PERSON> Yoon </PERSON> <PERSON> Gil-joong </PERSON> at the presidential residence. The officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, did not specify how many prisoners would be freed. In a series of recent meetings, <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Dae-jung </PERSON> and three other opposition leaders urged <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> to speed democratic reforms and release all political prisoners. Hundreds of political prisoners have been freed since nationwide protests in 1987 forced the government to accept opposition demands for reforms. Opposition parties contend more than 500 dissidents still are imprisoned or facing trial for anti-government activity or political beliefs. The government claims fewer than 100 dissidents remain in prison.

<HEAD>President Offers Peace Plan With Guerrillas In National Address</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Virgilio </PERSON> <PERSON> Barco </PERSON>, in a national address, offered to start peace talks with leftist guerrillas who have attacked two northern <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> towns within a week. <PERSON> Barco </PERSON> told a national television audience Thursday night that the talks should conclude with the dissolution of guerrilla organizations. Guerrillas must stop their terrorist acts, human rights violations, kidnappings and extortions before talks begin, <PERSON> Barco </PERSON> said. He said a peace agreement should be reached by March 1990, when the next presidential and parliamentary elections are scheduled. The offer came two days after guerrillas firing automatic assault rifles, throwing hand grenades and setting fire to houses killed 12 peasants, Gov. <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Gabriel </PERSON> <PERSON> Amin </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Cordoba </LOCATION> state said. An estimated 30 guerrillas of the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> set fire to a ranch, killed 10 peasants and wounded 15 Tuesday near the town of <LOCATION> Canalete </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Amin </PERSON> said Thursday. Canalete is about 320 miles north of <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION>. The insurgents then attacked the nearby village of <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Tomate </LOCATION>, setting fire to 26 huts and killing two people, the governor said in a broadcast interview with the Colombian radio chain <ORGANIZATION> RCN </ORGANIZATION>. In <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Tomate </LOCATION>, a village of 600 people, the attackers left messages painted on walls declaring, `` Death to the toads and paramilitaries,'' survivors said in interviews with RCN. Guerrillas call army informants toads. Peasants in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> have long claimed that they are caught between the army and the guerrillas. In dozens of interviews with The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, peasants have told of being forced to sell food and other necessities to guerrillas. Often soldiers force the peasants to give information about guerrilla movements, the peasants say. The guerrillas then return and kill the peasants, accusing them of being army informants, the peasants have said. The <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> and another guerrilla group known as the <ORGANIZATION> Colombian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> attacked the town of <LOCATION> Saisa </LOCATION> in the state of <LOCATION> Cordoba </LOCATION> on Aug. 23 and killed 12 civilians, 10 soldiers and two policemen, the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> said. Twenty-two soldiers and policemen were taken prisoner, the ministry said.

<HEAD>Hong Kong Planning New Shelter For Boat People</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HONG KONG (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The government said today it will build a new emergency shelter for the growing number of Vietnamese refugees arriving by boat to this British colony. The center, which is to open by the end of September, will be the sixth center built to house Vietnamese boat people who landed after mid-June. <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> announced a new policy that classified most of the boat people who arrived after June 15 as illegal immigrants subject to repatriation. Vietnamese who arrived earlier are considered political refugees eligible for resettlement. More than 9,000 new refugees _ including 2,375 in August _ arrived since the measure took effect, although it was designed to stop the rising influx of boat people. The number of Vietnamese in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> refugee camps totals 25,000, according to government statistics. The new center is expected to shelter about 3,000 people in huts, the government said. Some residents near the site of the future shelter said they will oppose it unless authorities guarantee local services will not be disrupted, government-run radio reported. <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION> said it will examine on a case-by-case basis the Vietnamese who arrived in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> after mid-June, if they volunteer to return to their homeland, 500 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>. However, only 1 percent of the boat people have requested repatriation to their communist homeland, and none has returned so far, a government spokeswoman said today. The <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> High Commissioner for Refugees is processing their applications to return.

<HEAD>Coast Guard Sends Icebreaker to Help Cruise Ship in Beaufort Sea</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 An intellectuals' cruise ship trapped in the ice inside the <ORGANIZATION> Arctic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circle </ORGANIZATION> awaited a <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> icebreaker today. The 149 passengers and crew members were in no danger, the cruise operator said. Passengers on the Society Explorer bound for the <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Passage </ORGANIZATION> were paying an average of $ 400 a day as clients of a company specializing in educational journeys to unconventional destinations, including <LOCATION> Antarctica </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> said the 236-foot ship was caught in <LOCATION> Beaufort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> ice 50 miles northeast of Point Barrow, or about 400 miles inside the <LOCATION> Arctic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Circle </LOCATION>. The crew notified Canadian maritime officials on Wednesday the ship was stranded. The <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday that one of its icebreakers, based in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>, was bound for the area on a research mission and was diverted to help the cruise vessel. The 399-foot icebreaker was expected to reach the ship Saturday. The Society Explorer set sail from <LOCATION> Dutch </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION> on Aug. 19. Stops have included the <LOCATION> Pribilof </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Gambell </PERSON> and the Siberian port of <LOCATION> Provideniya </LOCATION>. The itinerary calls for the ship to sail east along the <LOCATION> Northwest </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Passage </LOCATION>, with the voyage scheduled to end in St. <PERSON> John </PERSON>'s, <LOCATION> Newfoundland </LOCATION>, on Sept. 21. That schedule likely will be set back several days, said <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Cox </PERSON>, planning director for <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Expedition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cruises </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>, which offers trips that emphasize libraries and lectures. The passengers, most of them Americans, found intellectual pursuits to fill the time while awaiting the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION>. `` Our entertainment on board is mostly intellectual entertainment, not gambling and dancing,'' <PERSON> Cox </PERSON> said. He said the company caters to an `` extremely well-educated and a very naturalist-oriented passenger.'' He said the ship is `` absolutely safe'' and well-stocked with items on its continental menu. <PERSON> Cox </PERSON> likened the <LOCATION> Beaufort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> to `` a big jigsaw puzzle'' of ice and water. A wind rearranged the ice to the ship's disadvantage, said <PERSON> Randy </PERSON> <PERSON> Crosby </PERSON> of North Slope Borough Search and Rescue. The rescue unit planned to fly over the ship for a look but was held back by heavy fog Thursday, <PERSON> Crosby </PERSON> said. Employees of an Alaskan air-service company who flew over the vessel on Wednesday said it was caught in seven to eight miles of ice.

Brothers <PERSON> Gerard </PERSON> <PERSON> Harte </PERSON>, 29, and <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Harte </PERSON>, 21, were to be buried after a service at <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mary </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>, and 26-year-old <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Mullin </PERSON>'s funeral was to be held Saturday at the nearby village of <LOCATION> Dunmoyle </LOCATION>. Police said they were shot and killed in a British army ambush Tuesday and that the trio was plotting to kill an off-duty soldier. Dozens of police with riot shields and batons deployed in the village and along the road to the <PERSON> Harte </PERSON> family home, apparently to prevent the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> turning the funeral into an anti-British show of strength. The <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> said it honored its dead comrades with a ceremonial volley in the <LOCATION> Loughmacrory </LOCATION> area Thursday night. In <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION>, a police spokesman who demanded anonymity said police fired plastic bullets to disperse rioters during violence in Roman Catholic areas of the city that flared Thursday night and continued early today. Police said that in rioting earlier Thursday in a west <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION> IRA stronghold, three people were slightly injured and taken to the hospital when troops fired plastic bullets at a hostile crowd. Police said the rioting in <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION> late Thursday and early today was not on the scale of riots that broke out Wednesday. In those riots, gangs of young <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> supporters set fire to a bus, two vans and more than 35 cars, and hurled gasoline bombs and rocks at security forces while a gunman fired on the city's <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Barnsley </LOCATION> police station. Dozens of burned out vehicles still blocked some roads in the area Thursday night as groups of youths gathered at street corners, talking and drinking beer while police and army patrols cruised by. Police said the three slain <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> men were armed, masked and driving in a stolen car when they were ambushed. They said <PERSON> Gerard </PERSON> <PERSON> Harte </PERSON> was the commander of the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Mid-Tyrone </ORGANIZATION> unit and that <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Harte </PERSON> was responsible for selecting <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> targets from the ranks of the police and the <ORGANIZATION> Ulster </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regiment </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Harte </PERSON> was arrested during police raids following the Aug. 20 bus bombing but was released without charge, they said. The <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> in a statement Wednesday said the <PERSON> Harte </PERSON> brothers and <PERSON> Mullin </PERSON>, 26, were on `` active service'' _ a guerrilla euphemism for a bombing or shooting mission _ when they were slain. The mainly <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> is fighting to end British rule in Protestant-dominated <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> and unite it with the mainly <LOCATION> Catholic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> under socialist rule. Organizers of Sport Aid, a worldwide charity run scheduled for Sept. 11, announced that the army had withdrawn from participation in an event at <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Hyde </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>, citing the heightened <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> threat to military personnel.

<TEXT>
 It's last call for Stag Beer. <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Galati </PERSON> pushed the last case of beer off the <ORGANIZATION> Stag </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brewery </ORGANIZATION> production line at 1 p.m. Thursday, ending a brewing era in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>. `` As the final case came through, a lot of memories flashed in my mind,'' said <PERSON> Galati </PERSON>, a machine operator at <LOCATION> Stag </LOCATION> for 11 years. `` I felt bad. It was a depressing moment for me.'' <PERSON> Stag </PERSON> was <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION>' last full-scale brewery, and at 130 years was one of the oldest in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION>. The closing put about 200 people out of work. <ORGANIZATION> G. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Heileman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brewing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, which owns Stag, announced June 27 its was closing the brewery because of its age, excess capacity at other <PERSON> Heileman </PERSON> plants and the need to spend $ 2.9 million for a sewage plant for the brewery. The LaCrosse, Wis.-based beer company and <LOCATION> Belleville </LOCATION> officials continue to search for investors willing to reopen the brewery. Mayor <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Brauer </PERSON> said last week an unidentified investor was considering making an offer to buy the brewery. But <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Perleberg </PERSON>, director of planning and development for <PERSON> Heileman </PERSON>, said Thursday, `` We have received no offers and I have no comment further than that.'' <PERSON> Heileman </PERSON> bought the brewery from <ORGANIZATION> Carling </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Breweries </ORGANIZATION> in 1979. Last fall, Australian brewing giant <ORGANIZATION> Bond </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Holdings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION> purchased <PERSON> Heileman </PERSON> for $ 1.22 billion The company closed a brewery in <LOCATION> Evansville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ind. </LOCATION>, earlier this year. Workers who trickled out of the Stag plant Thursday said they were resigned to the closing. `` It was very quiet at work today,'' said <PERSON> Galati </PERSON>, 34. `` There was a lot of hugging and hand-shaking. ... I'm going to miss the money and working with the guys. I've been working with some of these guys for so long, I'll miss seeing them every day.'' About 180 employees had been laid off by Thursday. The remaining 50 will be kept on indefinitely to handle distribution of the remaining stock, close the books and maintain equipment in hopes an investor will save the plant. <PERSON> Greg </PERSON> <PERSON> Beaston </PERSON>, 27, said his grandfather, father and four brothers have worked at the brewery. He said he hopes the brewery is reopened soon. `` The shorter the time it is shut down, the quicker it can be started back up,'' <PERSON> Beaston </PERSON> said.

 Feuding black political organizations today signed an agreement aimed at ending the country's bloodiest ongoing conflict, in which more than 600 people have died in 20 months. The fighting in <ORGANIZATION> Natal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Province </ORGANIZATION> has pitted supporters of militant anti-apartheid organizations against members of <ORGANIZATION> Inkatha </ORGANIZATION>, a more conservative group headed by prominent Zulu leader <PERSON> Mangosuthu </PERSON> <PERSON> Buthelezi </PERSON>. Inkatha's secretary general, <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> <PERSON> Dhlomo </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Naidoo </PERSON>, secretary general of the militant <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> African Trade Unions, signed the agreement at a courthouse in the provincial capital, <LOCATION> Pietermaritzburg </LOCATION>. The labor federation, known as <ORGANIZATION> COSATU </ORGANIZATION>, has been allied with the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, a now-banned anti-apartheid coalition, in the feud against <ORGANIZATION> Inkatha </ORGANIZATION>. The agreement condemns violence and calls for formation of a conciliation board which would review residents' complaints of harassment or attacks. The board's members would be selected jointly by the two sides and have disciplinary powers. As part of the agreement, each side will drop pending court cases accusing the other of violence. `` Each party recognizes the immediate necessity to make it abundantly clear to its members that <ORGANIZATION> COASTU </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Inkatha </ORGANIZATION> categorically condemn acts of intimidation, forced recruitment and violence,'' the agreement says. `` All political organizations have the right to exist and the <ORGANIZATION> democratic </ORGANIZATION> right to espouse their own particular viewpoint,'' it says. Most of the fighting has been in the black townships around <LOCATION> Pietermaritzburg </LOCATION> but has spread in recent months to townships near the larger port city of <LOCATION> Durban </LOCATION>. Many of the killings have been to avenge earlier killings. Both Inkatha, which claims 1.5 million members, and the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> Front-COSATU alliance oppose the apartheid policies which enable <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s 5 million whites to dominate 26 million blacks. But their strategies differ markedly. The front, a predominantly black coalition of about 600 groups, advocates economic sanctions, strikes and other confrontational measures to bring about sweeping political and economic change. Inkatha opposes sanctions, avoids militant protest and advocates capitalism. Many militants view <PERSON> Buthelezi </PERSON> as a government collaborator because he is chief minister of the <ORGANIZATION> KwaZulu </ORGANIZATION> homeland. However, <PERSON> Buthelezi </PERSON> has rejected invitations by the government to join in negotiating reforms that would expand blacks' political role while leaving whites in ultimate control. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Kerschoff </PERSON>, a social worker in <LOCATION> Pietermaritzburg </LOCATION> who has been involved in past reconciliation efforts, said the agreement was an important but not final step toward ending the conflict. Because of government bans and restrictions `` it is extremely difficult for <ORGANIZATION> COSATU </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> UDF </ORGANIZATION> to communicate with grassroots people. This will have to be addressed,'' he said in a telephone interview. The <ORGANIZATION> Natal </ORGANIZATION> violence has distressed other anti-apartheid campaigners and caused debate over whether black political groups could avoid factional fights and effectively oppose the white-led government. Some commentators viewed the conflict as a harbinger of widespread black infighting that might develop as black groups with different ideologies struggled for supremacy.

 A Titan rocket today propelled into space a secret military payload that a civilian expert identified as a satellite capable of eavesdropping on Soviet military and diplomatic communications. The powerful, 16-story-tall Titan 34D, scoring its third straight success after being grounded for 18 months, thundered from its launch pad at 8:05 a.m. The <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> did not announce the launch in advance, which has been its practice on military space flights, and afterward said only that the Titan 34D, `` carrying a classified military payload,'' was successfully launched. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pike </PERSON>, a space policy expert for the Washington-based <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Scientists </ORGANIZATION>, said last month the payload would be a satellite to monitor Soviet missile tests and radio, telephone, radar and other electronic military and diplomatic communications. He said the payload carried an antenna built to unfold to the size of a baseball field. <PERSON> Pike </PERSON> said the satellite project originally was code-named Chalet but was changed to Vortex when <PERSON> Chalet </PERSON> became known. Vortex became compromised some time ago and yet another name may have been substituted, he said. The Titan 34D will remain the nation's most powerful unmanned rocket until an upgraded version, the Titan 4, makes its launch debut later this year, also with a military satellite. Both are made by <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Marietta </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>. A Titan 34D carrying a reconnaissance satellite was launched in October from <ORGANIZATION> Vandenberg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>. Another blasted away from <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canaveral </LOCATION> a month later and placed in orbit a satellite to provide warning of a missile attack Before the October launch, the Titan 34D had been grounded following two straight explosions of the rocket.

 Hundreds of thousands of anti-government protesters marched today through major cities, and demonstrators took over dozens of towns across the country, sources said. Students and <ORGANIZATION> Buddhist </ORGANIZATION> monks led the protesters in <LOCATION> Moulmein </LOCATION>, 50 miles east of the capital of <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION>, a Western diplomat said. He said some protesters occupied local government buildings. `` We estimate that up to 40 townships are under the control of the people,'' he said, speaking on condition of anonymity. In <LOCATION> Monywa </LOCATION>, 400 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION>, an estimated 300,000 people, including striking government workers and policemen, rallied for democracy and rejected the president's call to return to work, a resident said. Thousands of people also rallied peacefully in <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION>, but far fewer were in the streets than the estimated 100,000 who rallied the day before. The demonstrations today were concentrated near two major rallying points, <ORGANIZATION> Rangoon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION>. Demonstrators have demanded formation of an interim government to lead the country back to democracy. President <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> said Thursday that this would be unconstitutional, but he said the ruling party planned a Sept. 12 congress to consider a referendum on ending 26 years of authoritarian single-party rule. A leading dissident, former Defense Minister Tin Oo, said today: `` It is no longer necessary to hold a referendum. The whole country has rejected one-party rule. Only an interim government will be able to ... ease the situation.'' A lawyer speaking for the new League for Democracy and Peace, headed by former President <PERSON> Win </PERSON> <PERSON> Maung </PERSON>, said: `` It is no time to talk about constitutionality at this stage. The situation calls for an immediate change of government.'' A statement from the <ORGANIZATION> Rangoon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lawyers </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> said the government violated the Constitution by shooting demonstrators and indefinitely detaining suspects. `` It is ridiculous to talk about constitutionality by the government that has violated the Constitution on various occasions,'' it said. In his speech, <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> also said his government would legalize student unions, banned since 1962, and rebuild the <ORGANIZATION> Rangoon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Student </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Building </ORGANIZATION>, which the army destroyed in suppressing dissent that year. But about 3,000 students rejected that and marched through the streets of the capital. They and thousands of others, including striking government workers, shouted: `` The students' cause and the people's cause are indivisible.'' A 17-year-old student leader called <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> <PERSON> Maung </PERSON>'s speech, `` a cunning trick to divide students from the people.'' `` We are fighting not only for students' rights, but for the entire people. We will continue to demonstrate until the one-party regime is replaced by a democratic regime,'' he said. The diplomat said protesters have called for the biggest demonstrations ever in <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION> on Sept. 8. On Thursday night, the newly formed <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democracy </ORGANIZATION>, which is composed of 21 elder statesmen and former military officiers, called a news conference to air demands for an interim government. The diplomat said they called on protesters to vacate government buildings to avoid confrontation. The government Wednesday warned it would take action against the illegal occupiers, but the diplomat said there were no signs it was carrying out the threat. Traffic has become considerably lighter in <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> with an ongoing strike at the nation's oil refineries and a shortage of gasoline. <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION>'s airport reopened today, and <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burma </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> resumed international flights. Striking employees closed the airport Thursday, further isolating the Southeast Asian nation. <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>'s national airline halted domestic flights on Aug. 26. In <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>, a <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> diplomat said it is `` only a matter of time'' before former leader Ne Win flees from <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION> and that the 77-year-old ex-general probably will go either to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>. `` Ne Win's departure would lance the boil in <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>,'' the diplomat said, also speaking anonymously. Ne Win led the 1962 military coup that ended democracy in <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION> and ushered in authoritarian rule. He resigned July 23, taking indirect responsibility for bloody, student-led riots in March and June, and he called for a referendum on single-party rule. But the ruling <ORGANIZATION> Burma </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Program </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> rejected the referendum and picked hardliner <PERSON> Sein </PERSON> <PERSON> Lwin </PERSON> to succeed him. Nationwide anti-government demonstrations followed and turned bloody Aug. 8 when troops fired on crowds. By official count, at least 112 people were killed in <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> alone before <PERSON> Sein </PERSON> <PERSON> Lwin </PERSON> resigned Aug. 12. One week later, <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> became <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>'s first civilian leader in 26 years, but pro-democracy demonstrations continued.

 Princess <PERSON> Beatrice </PERSON>, the newest member of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s royal family, got a king-sized baby shower from this community of the same name. The daughter of <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> and <PERSON> Sarah </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Duke </ORGANIZATION> and Duchess of <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, received in absentia a regal array of gifts, from a college scholarship to a library card and a key to the city of 13,000. <PERSON> Beatrice </PERSON>, born Aug. 8, is fifth in line to the throne.

The cake, festooned with pink frosting roses, spelled out the difference. It read: `` Be-AT-trice welcomes Princess BE-a-trice.'' Her Royal Highness will receive a bevy of bibs, some cross-stitched with her name, others crocheted. There were also baby booties, baby-sized high-topped tennis shoes, a quilt, a rattle, an American flag, an atlas with the town of <LOCATION> Beatrice </LOCATION> marked, a deck of cards, a toothbrush and a miniature pink sand castle, labeled fit for a princess. `` I'm not sure the gifts are the traditional kind, but it's been fun for the community,'' <PERSON> Bayne </PERSON> said. Some residents dropped off cards, including one from a young girl who wished <PERSON> Beatrice </PERSON> the best of luck and added, `` I hope you find a handsome prince to marry.'' The princess has been made an honorary citizen of the community and residents said they hope she'll make it there someday. If she does, she will be able to check out a book from the the town library with her own library card.

 A <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> private and her 9-year-old son are the only Americans identified among 49 people killed in a fiery crash at an air show at a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> base, <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> officials said today. The officials also lowered their death toll from Sunday's disaster Earlier they said 52 people died when three Italian jet fighters collided during the air show and one plowed into a crowd at the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> base in <LOCATION> Ramstein </LOCATION>. West German officials said a badly burned male victim died Thursday, raising the death toll to 49. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and West German officials now have the same death toll, said base spokeswoman <PERSON> Monika </PERSON> <PERSON> Stuppy </PERSON>. `` There was so much confusion at the beginning. Now we are meeting twice a day to coordinate more closely on this,'' Ms. <PERSON> Stuppy </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> identified the two dead Americans as <PERSON> Joshua </PERSON> <PERSON> Frymyer </PERSON>, 9, and his mother, <LOCATION> Pfc </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Genevieve </PERSON> <PERSON> Riggs </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> 110th </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Military </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Pirmasens </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. The child is survived by his father, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Frymyer </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Lewistown </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Penn. </LOCATION>, an <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> statement said. No ages were available for the parents. Mrs. <PERSON> Riggs </PERSON>' husband, <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> Sgt. <PERSON> Myron </PERSON> <PERSON> Riggs </PERSON>, 24, who was severely burned in the disaster, served in the same military police unit as his wife. He was flown Tuesday to <ORGANIZATION> Brooke </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, the unofficial <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military newspaper Stars and Stripes reported. West German officials said 40 of the dead have been identified. In addition to the two Americans, they are 33 West Germans, a Dutch citizen, a French citizen, and the three Italian pilots, according to <PERSON> Juergen </PERSON> <PERSON> Dietzen </PERSON>, spokesman for <LOCATION> Rhineland-Palatinate </LOCATION> state, where <LOCATION> Ramstein </LOCATION> is located. <PERSON> Dietzen </PERSON> said 172 people remained in hospitals, including some who had been released and returned after their condition worsened at home. He said the hospitalized victims were 144 West Germans, 16 Americans, two Britons, and one each from <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>. He did not name the African country. Four more injured victims were not identified because they were `` unable to communicate due to the severity of their injuries,'' he said. Meanwhile, a West German medical expert charged today that rescue work after the air show disaster was seriously flawed and that many burn victims were sent to hospitals incapable of handling their injuries. `` The organizational handling of the catastrophe ... was a scandal and an unbelievable failure of those responsible,'' said <PERSON> Leo </PERSON> <PERSON> Koslowski </PERSON>, an expert on burns and former director of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Surgical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Clinic </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Tuebingen </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Wolfgang </PERSON> <PERSON> Herbig </PERSON>, director of the nearby <LOCATION> Kaiserslautern </LOCATION> hospital, where many of the injured were taken, said there were not enough mobile medical teams available at the air base after the accident. But officials of <LOCATION> Rhineland-Palatinate </LOCATION> state strongly defended the rescue efforts and praised the cooperation between Americans and Germans.

 About 20 Iraqi Kurds occupied the <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> offices of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> today and accused <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> of using chemical weapons against their people, a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> official said.

 A spokesman for Kurdish rebels fighting <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> government troops claimed today that the <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> army slaughtered about 1,300 unarmed men, women and children this week. The official <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> agency quoted Kurdish refugees as saying their houses were set on fire and they fled into the mountains without food. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, a group of 20 Kurds occupied the offices of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>, accusing <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> of using chemical weapons against their people and demanding that <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Secretary-General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> intervene. An official of the Kurdish <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Nicosia </LOCATION> in a telephone interview that the 1,300 victims were arrested Aug. 28 in the <LOCATION> Dahok </LOCATION> region in northwestern <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, killed and buried in mass graves. In addition, 43,000 people trying to get out of the region are being held back by the <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> military, said the spokesman. There was no way to independently confirm the report. He said the refugees were `` suffering from hunger, disease and serious chemical injuries.'' The spokesman, based in a <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> capital, declined to give his name for `` security reasons.'' <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION>, monitored in <LOCATION> Nicosia </LOCATION>, quoted a Kurd identified as 38-year-old <PERSON> Hakim </PERSON> <PERSON> Refaq </PERSON> as saying, `` My house has been set on fire three times and for weeks we had to live in the mountains without food or any other facilities.'' It quoted other men as saying numerous villages had been destroyed by the Iraqi army and that Kurdish families were being imprisoned in camps. The ferocious battles between the Kurdish rebels and the Iraqi army are escalating, the rebel spokesman said. `` Fierce fighting is now taking place around our main base,'' said the spokesman. The base, called The First Branch, is in <LOCATION> Amadiyah </LOCATION>. He said the Iraqi northern-based 1st and 5th army corps as well as the 7th army corps based in the south and the elite Presidential guards were all fighting the Kurds. The rebels estimated Wednesday that 60,000 troops backed by fighter-bombers and helicopter gunships were fighting against them. In addition to burning villages, he said the <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> army used chemical weapons to attack three villages in the <LOCATION> Amadiyah </LOCATION> area Wednesday and Thursday. The spokesman said thousands of Kurdish refugees were trying to flee to <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>, with 90,000 already resettled there. `` We call upon the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> and the international community to intervene and stop this war of genocide against our people,'' he said. The Turkish and Iranian governments have reported that thousands of Kurdish refugees have been streaming across their borders with <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>, Premier <PERSON> Turgut </PERSON> <PERSON> Ozal </PERSON> said Thursday that 60,000 refugees had arrived since the country opened its borders two weeks ago. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> supported the Kurdish guerrillas fighting for autonomy in northern <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> during the 8-year gulf war. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> launched an offensive to crush the Kurdish rebellion after <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> accepted a U.N.-sponsored cease-fire Aug. 20. There are about 20 million Kurds living in the mountains where the borders of <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> meet, and <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> have small Kurdish enclaves. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s 3.5 million Kurds have been fighting on and off for an autonomous homeland for 50 years.

 <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Solzhenitsyn </PERSON>, who was expelled from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> after he chronicled the horrors of <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>'s rule, was asked to join an officially sanctioned committee building a monument to <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>'s victims An organizer said today the move did not necessarily indicate an easing in official attitudes toward the dissident writer, whose works angered the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION>, but reflected the number of Soviet citizens who think <PERSON> Solzhenitsyn </PERSON> is one of the best qualified people to serve on the committee. <PERSON> Solzhenitsyn </PERSON>, who won the 1970 Nobel Prize in literature, wrote `` The Gulag Archipelago,'' which traces the history of political repression in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, especially the purges and repression during <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>'s 29-year reign. <PERSON> Solzhenitsyn </PERSON>, who himself spent eight years in labor camps under <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>, was expelled from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> in 1974 following the publication of the `` Gulag'' trilogy in the West. He now lives in <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION>. Under Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> and his legacy have received increasingly severe criticism. In July, the ruling <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Politburo </ORGANIZATION> approved the building of a monument in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> to <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>'s victims. On Aug. 25, a public council to supervise the construction and maintenance of the monument was formed, as well as an executive committee to submit a blueprint for the memorial's design. Among those selected for the public council were <PERSON> Solzhenitsyn </PERSON>, fellow dissident and Nobel Peace laureate <PERSON> Andrei </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON>, poet <PERSON> Yevgeny </PERSON> <PERSON> Yevtushenko </PERSON> and <PERSON> Boris </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON>, the fiery former <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> party boss. <PERSON> Yuri </PERSON> <PERSON> Samadunov </PERSON>, a member of the executive committee, said members of the public council had been chosen in street polls conducted at two central <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> locations, as well as from names submitted by readers to <ORGANIZATION> Literaturnaya </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gazeta </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Ogonyok </PERSON> and other state-run publications. `` We chose the first 17 people mentioned, and <PERSON> Solzhenitsyn </PERSON> was among them,'' <PERSON> Samadunov </PERSON> said in a telephone interview. This week's edition of <ORGANIZATION> Moscow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> listed <PERSON> Solzhenitsyn </PERSON> as a member of the public council charged with building the memorial. However, <PERSON> Samadunov </PERSON> said the committee had not yet been able to notify <PERSON> Solzhenitsyn </PERSON> that he had been selected for the committee, or to determine whether he would agree to take part in its work. `` We sent him a telegram with news of his selection and that of the others, and asked his agreement, but the telegram was returned to us with a notice that it could not be delivered because the address was not precise enough,'' said <PERSON> Samadunov </PERSON>. <PERSON> Solzhenitsyn </PERSON>'s wife has previously denied that the writer intends to visit the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. In June, the editor of the literary monthly Novy Mir said he was negotiating for the right to print <PERSON> Solzhenitsyn </PERSON>'s novel `` Cancer Ward,'' which would mark the first publication of the author's work in his native land since he was expelled in 1974.

<HEAD>Indictments Announced In $1.6 Billion Drug Ring</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MONTGOMERY, Ala. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A billion-dollar drug ring gunned down the mother of a potential witness, hatched terrorist-like plots to free their jailed kingpin and laundered profits through phony coal companies, prosecutors allege. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> on Thursday announced the indictment of 25 alleged members of the ring on conspiracy, racketeering and obstruction charges. Eighteen were in custody Thursday; the others remained at large. The ring, described as one of the biggest in the Southeast, smuggled 33 tons of cocaine worth $ 1.6 billion into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> over five years, <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> <PERSON> LeQuire </PERSON>, the alleged ringleader, has been in prison since before his conviction in a 1983 smuggling operation involving about 710 pounds of high-grade Colombian cocaine. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Warner </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> agent, said that case launched the probe that resulted in the indictment unsealed this week. Cocaine was brought from <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> into small or remote airports in <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> and hauled to <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> for sale, authorities said. <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> said the ring set up several phony coal companies in <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> and one in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> to launder its profits, which helped finance a lavish life of yachts and <ORGANIZATION> Jaguars </ORGANIZATION> for some members. Members of the ring committed crimes ranging from the machine-gun slaying of a witness' mother to witness tampering and attempting to record grand jury proceedings, prosecutors said. In one of the alleged escape plots hatched to free <PERSON> LeQuire </PERSON> from prison, <PERSON> LeQuire </PERSON> in 1985 came up with a scheme to blow up power lines, airports, dams and Naval vessels to convince authorities that terrorists were active in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, according to the indictment, which gave no further explanation. The organization had profits totaling more than $ 280 million in the year beginning July 1982 alone, and the same amount of cash was buried in vaults on a farm in <LOCATION> Greenback </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> said. `` This is probably one of the biggest -LRB- importation operations -RRB- in the <LOCATION> Southeastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' said <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agent <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Shockley </PERSON>. The indictment, unsealed Tuesday in <LOCATION> Knoxville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>, and announced here Thursday, named <PERSON> LeQuire </PERSON> as the leader of a gang that <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> said smuggled 33 tons of cocaine, one ton of marijuana and 1,200 methaqualone tablets into the Southeast from 1981 to 1986. <PERSON> Ira </PERSON> <PERSON> DeMent </PERSON>, an attorney who along with defense lawyer <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON> is representing <PERSON> LeQuire </PERSON>, had no comment on the indictment.

<TEXT>
 Mothers Against Drunk Driving and other organizations will focus attention this weekend on efforts to end drunken driving with national advertisements, local events and a request that motorists turn on their headlights, officials announced today. Representatives of <ORGANIZATION> MADD </ORGANIZATION>, federal, state and local governments and <ORGANIZATION> Volkswagen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> States </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> asked Americans to promise to not drink and drive on Saturday and to show support for the `` Drive for Life'' program by driving with their headlights on. `` We're asking all Americans to make this pledge with the hope that they will continue their commitment never to drink and drive,'' <PERSON> Norma </PERSON> <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON>, national president of <ORGANIZATION> MADD </ORGANIZATION>, told a news conference. Last year, 23,632 Americans were killed and 560,000 were injured in accidents attributed to drunken driving, according to <ORGANIZATION> MADD </ORGANIZATION>. On last year's Drive for Life day, the traffic fatality rate dropped 28 percent, <ORGANIZATION> MADD </ORGANIZATION> says. `` We must constantly remind the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people of these statistics, and do all we can to mobilize them to stop the carnage,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Burnley </PERSON>. Under a congressional resolution signed by President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, this weekend has been proclaimed National Drive for Life Weekend.

<TEXT>
 A woman who posed either as a sex surrogate or someone bored with sex on three TV talk shows says a sex therapist asked her to `` play the part,'' but the therapist says he did n't intend to deceive anyone. <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dauw </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> clinical psychologist, licensed sex therapist and author, defended himself during an appearance via satellite Thursday on `` The <PERSON> Sally </PERSON> <PERSON> Jessy </PERSON> <PERSON> Raphael </PERSON> <PERSON> Show </PERSON>,'' which is taped here. `` I never intended to perpetrate a ruse. I never said ` Go pretend,''' <PERSON> Dauw </PERSON> said. Appearing in person was <PERSON> Tani </PERSON> <PERSON> Freiwald </PERSON>, 37, a former office manager for <PERSON> Dauw </PERSON> who earlier this year posed as either a sex surrogate or a woman bored with sex on talk shows hosted by <PERSON> Raphael </PERSON>, <PERSON> Oprah </PERSON> <PERSON> Winfrey </PERSON> and <PERSON> Geraldo </PERSON> <PERSON> Rivera </PERSON>. <PERSON> Wes </PERSON> <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON>, 33, also of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, who pretended on one show to be a virgin and on another to be an impotent husband, also was interviewed via satellite. He and Ms. <PERSON> Freiwald </PERSON> have worked together in community theater. <PERSON> Raphael </PERSON> said she decided to do the program with the three, to be broadcast Sept. 8, to give the public a chance to question people who had `` blatantly lied.'' <PERSON> Dauw </PERSON> said he had given Ms. <PERSON> Freiwald </PERSON> some training in sexual surrogacy and `` I thought her to be functioning as a surrogate.'' `` I assumed, perhaps falsely, she was working with my other therapist,'' he said. Ms. <PERSON> Freiwald </PERSON> said she had done some research into sex surrogacy but decided it was not for her, and she charged that <PERSON> Dauw </PERSON> has asked her: `` Do you think you can play the part?'' `` You asked me to dress provocatively for these parts. You asked me to look like I was a sexy girl,'' she said. <PERSON> Dauw </PERSON> said he may also have falsely assumed that <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON>, a friend of Ms. <PERSON> Freiwald </PERSON>'s, was working with his other therapist. `` We were acting in good faith,'' said <PERSON> Dauw </PERSON>. `` It is very easy to have unclear communications or miscommunications.'' Ms. <PERSON> Freiwald </PERSON> said she had decided to play the part of a sex surrogate on <PERSON> Raphael </PERSON>'s show because it was `` an improvisational challenge I did n't think I could pass up'' and an opportunity to see how one of her favorite talk shows is produced. Ms. <PERSON> Freiwald </PERSON> said the deception had an educational value in that it showed `` you have to be a critical, analytical, participatory watcher of television.'' <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON> said he agreed to take part in the trickery because `` I felt it was like going white-water rafting or climbing a mountain.''

<TEXT>
 A burglar dubbed by authorities The Human Fly is apparently scaling high-rise buildings and entering apartments through open balcony doors, police said. The burglar has made nearly 50 nighttime hits in southeast <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> during the last six months. `` He's got to be athletic _ either a mountain climber or someone skilled,'' said Sgt. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Wiederspan </PERSON>. `` We think he's got to have some climbing equipment.'' Earlier this week, in one night, six apartments in a 10-story building were burglarized, police said. The apartments were on the third, sixth, eight, ninth and 10th floors and were entered through balcony doors. Police said The Fly may want thrills as much as money. His high-flying antics have cost his victims an average of only about $ 50, and his takes have ranged from $ 20 to $ 500, police said. The Fly has left some clues _ an occasional shoe print on a balcony railing or a screen door removed from its track. `` Originally, we hesitated to believe the victims,'' <PERSON> Wiederspan </PERSON> said. `` We thought it might have been an internal theft. You get a burglary on the eighth floor of a building you hesitate to believe someone is capable of doing it.'' But as more reports came in, police theorized he scales the sides of buildings and may occasionally exit through a hallway door, police said.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s commander in chief today said <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s claim to the disputed waterway at the southern end of their border was an attempt to rekindle the war, the official <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> reported. In a prayer sermon at <ORGANIZATION> Tehran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Hashemi </PERSON> <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> attacked <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s demand that the waterway _ known as the <LOCATION> Shatt-al-Arab </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> and as the <LOCATION> Arvand </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> _ be dredged and cleared of wreckage. <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON>, also parliament speaker, said <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> started the war `` with the prime goal of gaining control of the <LOCATION> Arvand </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> and was trying to rekindle it by repeating its aborted claim on the waterway,'' the <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION> report said. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> wants a 1975 treaty that split the waterway down the middle to remain in effect, but <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> claims the agreement is void. In <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION>, the government-run daily <ORGANIZATION> Ath-Thawra </ORGANIZATION> said it expected peace negotiations to `` be difficult, exactly like the difficulty of war.'' The newspaper said the Iranian government had nullified the treaty by declaring in 1980 that all agreements signed by <PERSON> Shah </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Reza </PERSON> <PERSON> Pahlavi </PERSON> were invalid. The shah was overthrown by an Islamic revolution in 1979. With regard to the negotiations, `` The most important thing is to realize that this is our chance to get all our rights on land, at sea and in the air,'' the newspaper said. In <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> said soldiers at the front must remain vigilant because there is a chance the war could start again. `` Even if the possibility of war becomes only 10 percent or 20 percent, we must remain attentive.'' <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON>'s remarks also were broadcast by <ORGANIZATION> Tehran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION>. Both reports were monitored in <LOCATION> Nicosia </LOCATION>. `` We want our armed forces to respect and obey the cease-fire, but in case the enemy does not, they -LRB- <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s forces -RRB- have a right to respond,'' said <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON>, echoing remarks he made in a television interview Thursday. Both sides have made repeated belligerent statements over the past few days as U.N.-sponsored peace talks in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> sputtered over troop withdrawals and control of the waterway. The foreign ministers of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> have not met for a week, although talks have continued at a lower level. Negotiations started Aug. 25. In <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>, Iranian Foreign Minister <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Akbar </PERSON> <PERSON> Velayati </PERSON> charged today that <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> has violated the gulf war cease-fire more than 60 times since it took effect two weeks ago, and he said <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> was blocking progress in the peace talks by raising `` new preconditions'' every day. <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> observers have not reported any serious cease-fire violations, only minor problems that they said were resolved.

 Iranian Foreign Minister <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Akbar </PERSON> <PERSON> Velayati </PERSON> today charged that <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> has violated the cease-fire in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> war more than 60 times since it took effect two weeks ago. <PERSON> Velayati </PERSON> also said <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> was raising new conditions every day to block progress in peace talks aimed at ending the eight-year conflict. In <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s commander in chief accused <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> of trying to rekindle the war by claiming the disputed Shatt-al-Arab waterway, the official <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> reported. The commander, <PERSON> Hashemi </PERSON> <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON>, made the remarks during a prayer sermon today at <ORGANIZATION> Tehran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Velayati </PERSON> spoke to reporters as he left the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> building after meeting with <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Eliasson </PERSON>, a Swedish diplomat who is the new <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> special representative for the talks. Shortly afterward, <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> Foreign Minister <PERSON> Tariq </PERSON> <PERSON> Aziz </PERSON> also met <PERSON> Eliasson </PERSON> to brief him on <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s position at the talks. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> is prepared to continue working `` sincerely and seriously'' toward full agreement on implementing the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> cease-fire resolution that forms the basis of the negotiations, <PERSON> Aziz </PERSON> told reporters. He did not comment on <PERSON> Velayati </PERSON>'s allegations. Both sides have traded charges of cease-fire violations. But <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> observers monitoring the truce did not report any serious violations by either side, only `` minor problems'' that were resolved. `` After the establishment of the cease-fire, <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> has had more than 60 kinds of violations of the terms of the cease-fire,'' <PERSON> Velayati </PERSON> said. `` We have some difficulties because day-by-day they raise some new preconditions.'' The two 90-minute meetings were <PERSON> Eliasson </PERSON>'s first talks with <PERSON> Velayati </PERSON> and <PERSON> Aziz </PERSON> on substantial issues. <PERSON> Eliasson </PERSON> was formally introduced to them by <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Secretary-General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> after <PERSON> Eliasson </PERSON>'s appointment Thursday. The two ministers have not met face-to-face since Aug. 26, when the talks stalled. Negotiations have continued at a lower, technical level since. <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON>, who had mediated the talks since they began Aug. 25, left <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> on Thursday because of other commitments. He said he was frustrated by the slow pace of the talks but that he was trying to end the stalemate. He said he would return to <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> if necessary. The talks are stalled over follow-up procedures to the cease-fire that went into effect Aug. 20. The major problem is the Shatt-al-Arab waterway, which forms the southern border between the two nations and is <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s only outlet to the sea. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> wants full control of the waterway and has repudiated a 1975 treaty that gave <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> control of half of the Shatt-al-Arab. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> says any peace settlement must include strict adherence to that treaty. A <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> compromise would guarantee free navigation for both nations in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>, withdrawal to internationally recognized borders and an impartial study of conflicting positions on the Shatt-al-Arab. The cease-fire resolution also calls for prisoner exchange and the work of a commission to determine which side started the war. On Thursday, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> accused <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> of taking more than 750 Iranian troops prisoner in attacks since the cease-fire began. The Iraqi government said <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> continued setting up observation posts and bunkers, moving troops close to the border and launching gunboats into the Shatt-al-Arab. A <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> report Thursday said <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> brainwashed <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> prisoners of war, turning many into fanatical supporters of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. The report also said many POWs from both nations are afraid to return home. The report was compiled by Maj. Gen. <PERSON> Rene </PERSON> <PERSON> Bats </PERSON> of the Belgian army and international law professors <PERSON> Wolfram </PERSON> <PERSON> Karl </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Salzburg </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Torkel </PERSON> <PERSON> Opsahl </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oslo </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION>. POW camps in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> were dominated by Iraqi prisoners who swore allegiance to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> and denounced <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s President <PERSON> Saddam </PERSON> <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> as an atheist, the report said. `` Cultural Committees'' in the camps provided religious and political instruction called `` spiritual guidance,'' it said. `` To us, it is indistinguishable from mental pressure.'' In <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, the report found no mental indoctrination of Iranian POWs but said the prisoners also were worried about going home. The <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> investigators estimated that <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> may be holding up to 70,000 POWs, and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> may have about 35,000 prisoners.

 An `` extremely cautious'' <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lines </ORGANIZATION> pilot aborted takeoff when a panel indicator warned of possible engine trouble on Flight 1141, on which a jet crashed and burned a day earlier. Six people aboard aborted Flight 1141 Thursday were among the 95 survivors of Wednesday's crash at <LOCATION> Dallas-Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>, which killed 13. The doomed plane also was a <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 727. `` He was only at a maximum of 20 knots -LRB- 23 mph -RRB- ... which is pretty slow for an airplane,'' said <PERSON> Glenda </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>. `` Then he gets an indicator on the panel that there is a momentary disruption of air flow'' in one of the engines. `` The captain feels that he had what is called a compressor stall,'' said another <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Berry </PERSON>. `` There was a crosswind blowing across the runway. That can interrupt the smoothness of the airflow that goes into the engine, creating a temporary loss of power.'' Under normal circumstances, a pilot would `` simply increase thrust to see if everything continued to perform right. But based on the incident that happened yesterday, the captain was extremely cautious and elected simply to come back to the gate and let maintenance look at the engine,'' <PERSON> Berry </PERSON> said. On any day, <PERSON> Berry </PERSON> said, captains `` have got to go by their years of experience'' and can abort flights `` if they do n't like what they feel, if they've just got a gut feeling.'' <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> declined to release the pilot's name. Today, <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> Flight 1141 departed Dallas-Fort Worth without incident. The flight was airborne at 8:49 a.m., a few minutes behind schedule. <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> officials at the terminal declined to talk to reporters, but several passengers who regularly take Flight 1141 said the plane carried only about half as many passengers as usual. Wednesday's Flight 1141, bound for <LOCATION> Salt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, crashed and burned shortly after takeoff. Federal investigators said the aircraft may have experienced an engine malfunction as it left the runway. Delta officials said no maintenance problems were found in the engine of the jetliner whose takeoff was aborted. Although officials said there never was any danger, many passengers appeared jolted after the plane returned to the gate. `` We figured this would be the safest flight we could ever take today,'' said <PERSON> Louise </PERSON> <PERSON> Cox </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Baton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rouge </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> La. </LOCATION>, as she waited to board another 727 for <LOCATION> Salt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. `` Evidently not.'' `` It was a routine takeoff until we got almost to the end of the runway,'' said Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Burkhalter </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Jackson </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Miss. </LOCATION>, where the flight originated. `` Then we heard what sounded like bumps and the pilot decelerated. He said there was a problem with the ` compressors,''' <PERSON> Burkhalter </PERSON> said. `` The captain said, and this is a quote, ` It's just one of those things.' We just laughed.'' It was a nervous laughter, said <PERSON> Burkhalter </PERSON>, who was on his way to <LOCATION> Fresno </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, with his wife. Thursday's flight carried 102 passengers and a crew of seven, said <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Conley </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Conley </PERSON> said that to his knowledge, all the passengers got on a substitute plane. A survivor from Wednesday's crash said he had trouble working up the courage to board Flight 1141 _ the flight that was aborted _ a day after the accident. `` You've got to do it sometime,'' said <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Black </PERSON>, 30, of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Monroe </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> La </LOCATION>. `` Ca n't live in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Burkhalter </PERSON> said two of the crash survivors aboard Thursday's flight whom he talked to appeared relatively calm, although one said `` he was a little nervous. Passenger <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Snelling </PERSON>, 30, of <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>, said he missed Wednesday's Flight 1141 because of a faulty alarm clock. Waiting to board the same flight Thursday, <PERSON> Snelling </PERSON> said, `` I'm a little apprehensive, but when the time's up it's up and I would have been on the plane yesterday.

 <LOCATION> WINDHOEK </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South-West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- _ The <ORGANIZATION> South-West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Africa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> today denied it planted a bomb at a hotel patronized by blacks and blamed <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. The blast killed two people and injured 15, police said. The three-story Continental Hotel was severely damaged by the explosion Thursday evening. Witnesses said parked cars were hurled across the street. About one mile away, a mine exploded 90 minutes later on a railroad line, but no one was injured, police said. Hospital officials earlier had said two people were hurt in the blast. The <ORGANIZATION> South-West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Africa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, or <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION>, has fought since 1966 for independence for the South Africa-ruled territory. It issued the denial from its office in <LOCATION> Lusaka </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Zambia </LOCATION>, and called the bombing one of `` <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s dirty tricks.'' The statement said: `` It is not <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION>'s policy to attack soft targets. This bomb attack was aimed at demoralizing white Namibians and setting them against <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION>.'' The explosions occurred on the day <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> said it would begin a voluntary cease-fire. The organization has fought a long guerrilla war against South African control of <LOCATION> South-West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, also known as <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>. The government-run broadcasting network said an anonymous telephone caller claimed responsibility on behalf of the guerrillas, and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s chief representative in the territory, <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Pienaar </PERSON>, blamed the bombing on <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION>. The guerrilla group normally attacks military targets or white residential or shopping areas, but the hotel was patronized by blacks. <PERSON> Pienaar </PERSON> did not explain why the guerrillas would bomb a hotel patronized by blacks. Firefighters needed more than 90 minutes to bring the blaze under control. <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> and other black groups have warned of a possible white backlash in <LOCATION> South-West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> because of preliminary South African proposals for independence elections that probably would result in government by the black majority. <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> said its guerrillas would stop launching attacks in the territory Thursday to contribute to a regional peace initiative involving <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> has administered <LOCATION> South-West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> for 73 years, despite repeated <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> resolutions since 1966 calling for independence in the territory. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> says it will begin withdrawing from <LOCATION> South-West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> on Nov. 1 and allow independence elections June 1, 1989, if <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> pulls its 50,000 troops out of <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> by June 1. On Tuesday, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> said it has pulled all its troops out of <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>, where it was fighting alongside rebels in their battle against <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>'s Marxist government and its <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> allies.

 Investigators are pointing to possible problems with <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> Flight 1141's engine thrust and wing flaps before it crashed on takeoff, and hope to get answers from the crew and the cockpit recordings. <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> investigators said Thursday a flap indicator handle in the wrecked cockpit was found in the wrong position for most takeoffs, raising questions whether the plane's wing flaps were set properly. Incorrectly set flaps led to the fatal crash of a <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> flight last summer. The <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lines </ORGANIZATION> flight's indicator handle, however, could have been accidently jarred during or after the crash, investigators said. The <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 727 got no more than 30 feet off the runway at <LOCATION> Dallas-Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> before it crashed Wednesday, witnesses told the <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION>. Thirteen people were killed. Pilots in planes waiting on adjacent taxiways told investigators `` a white flame or vapor'' came from the left engine, said <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION> member <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Dickinson </PERSON>. A cockpit tape recording recovered from the burned wreckage revealed that the pilots talked about engine trouble seconds before the crash, he said. Further review of the tape and the flight data recorder were planned today at the <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> laboratory. The jetliner crashed as it tried to take off for <LOCATION> Salt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> with 108 people aboard. Ninety-five people survived the crash, most by escaping through emergency exits or torn-open areas of the fuselage. Thirty-three remained hospitalized Thursday. Medical examiners said the 13 died from smoke inhalation. Many were trapped when an emergency door would n't open. The plane's flight engineer, <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Judd </PERSON>, told investigators that right after the plane took off the crew `` began experiencing problems keeping the plane stable and in the air,'' <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> reported today. `` Just before the crash, there was some talk of engine problems,'' <PERSON> Judd </PERSON> added, according to the Times, which attributed <PERSON> Judd </PERSON>'s statement Wednesday to an anonymous source. <PERSON> Judd </PERSON> and the two other members of the cockpit crew remained hospitalized today. Investigators said they had not recovered sufficiently to undergo full-scale debriefings, but that they hoped to interview First Officer <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirkland </PERSON> today. Control tower personnel said the jet may have taken longer than usual to become airborne and that it may have lifted off at a sharper angle than is considered normal, the investigators said. `` Obviously, one of the questions that we will be trying to get an answer to is why the airplne did not lift off the runway until about 8,500 to 9,000 feet down the runway. ... It was too long a distance for a runway takeoff,'' said <PERSON> Dickinson </PERSON>, noting the plane should have begun to take off between 5,500 feet and 6,000 feet. <PERSON> Dickinson </PERSON> said investigators also received maintenance records on the plane Thursday. The flap handle, on the console between the pilot and the first officer, indicates whether the flaps are in the proper position to provide the lift needed for takeoff. <PERSON> Dickinson </PERSON> said the handle was found in the up position, opposite where it should be for most takeoffs. But he said the handle could have been pushed into the wrong position by the impact or during the evacuation of the crew. `` It could have been kicked. It could have been moved. It could have been any number of things,'' <PERSON> Dickinson </PERSON> said. Flight crews of nearby planes told investigators they had `` no clear indication of the flap or slat positions,'' he said. Federal investigators determined that the flaps and slats of a <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> MD-80 were not properly set for takeoff when that plane crashed Aug. 16, 1987, at <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> Metropolitan airport, killing 156 people. Earlier, <PERSON> Dickinson </PERSON> told reporters the crew was warned of trouble by the `` stick shaker,'' which rattles the jet's steering mechanism when a problem develops. `` This indicates the plane may be approaching a point where it wo n't be able to fly,'' he said. `` Shortly after that, there was some conversation about an engine problem.'' But he stressed that the warning could have stemmed from something besides an engine problem. <PERSON> Dickinson </PERSON> said none of the jet's three rear-mounted engines showed signs of external damage, including the right one, which wound up separated from the fuselage. `` It is possible for an engine ... to belch out the rear something that would look to people like fire and smoke and yet to have no visible damage,'' said <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Loeb </PERSON>, deputy director of the <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION>'s bureau of accident investigation. All three of the JT-8D engines eventually will be removed and examined by their manufacturer, <ORGANIZATION> Pratt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Whitney </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Hartford </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn </LOCATION>. The same flight Thursday from <LOCATION> Dallas-Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Salt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> was aborted when the pilot detected a problem with his plane, another <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 727. Most of the 102 passengers, including six survivors of the crash Wednesday, left about two hours later on another jet, <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> said.

<HEAD>Lawmakers Finish Brazil's New Constitution</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRASILIA, Brazil (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Legislators today completed a l9-month process of drafting a new constitution to replace an authoritarian document handed down two decades ago by the military regime. The document shortens presidential terms to five years, abolishes cencorship, guarantees the right of workers to strike and rejects land reform. Elated lawmakers in the constituent assembly sang the national anthem and threw confetti into the air when speaker <PERSON> Ulysses </PERSON> <PERSON> Guimaraes </PERSON> closed the final sesion at 1:49 a.m. `` <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> is a new country,'' <ORGANIZATION> Guimaraes </ORGANIZATION> said. `` This constitution will protect the weak and punish those who abuse power.'' The final version appeared to be a mixture of radical, even nationalistic laws on foreign and domestic business and mainly conservative laws on issues such as land reform. Since February 1987, legislators have been working on the new charter, which replaces the 19-year-old constitution handed down by military generals during a 1964-1985 military regime. The new 245-article charter is to go into effect Sept. 23. It will be <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>'s eighth constitution in 166 years of independence. The 559 representatives and senators chosen in wide-ranging 1986 elections have been voting for several weeks on the more than 1,000 amendments to the 245-article final draft, which was completed in July. The draft itself was the result of more than a year of voting on an initial draft of more than 3,000 articles, derided by many because of its length. Over the past 19 months, legislators engaged in heated and often even violent debate over such controversial issues as land reform, the system of government <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> should adopt, the presidential term and the right to strike. Some of the key decisions are: _ President <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Sarney </PERSON> and future presidents will serve for five years, in contrast to the six-year term of former military presidents _ Censorship, a remnant of military days, was abolished in films, books and television _ The right to strike was guaranteed for all workers Before, `` essential'' sectors of the labor force were not allowed to strike. _ The assembly rejected wide-ranging land reform in a country where four percent of the people own 50 percent of the farmable land This countered a government promise to distribute land to 1.4 million landless peasant farmers. _ Decree law, a powerful tool used by the president to bypass <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and push through legislation, was also abolished _ The voting age was lowered from 18 to 16 years of age The only other country where 16 year olds can vote is <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. _ Maternity leave for new mothers was extended from 90 to 120 days and the work week was cut from 48 to 44 hours _ A 12 percent ceiling was imposed on interest rates charged above inflation Interest rates have been running as high 1,000 percent yearly, while inflation this year is expected to reach 700 percent. _ Mineral mining was nationalized and foreign companies now involved in mining will have to leave <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> in four years or transfer financial control to residents of the country _ New oil risk contracts allowing foreign companies to drill in oil-rich <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> were banned

 Residents of a tourist town outside <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> left overnight as a `` slop-over'' wildfire moved to within 1 -LCB- miles. Elsewhere in the West, campers were barred from the woods as the Labor Day weekend opened. Wildfires also burned over hundreds of thousands of acres in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Yellowstone </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mont. </LOCATION>, residents and tourists filled their gas tanks as flames to the west lit up the sky with an orange glow Thursday night. `` There are some pretty nervous people, no question about that,'' said <PERSON> Dawn </PERSON> <PERSON> Whitman </PERSON>, a gas station owner. The threat came from a quarter - to half-acre `` slop-over'' of a 109,100-acre fire inside the park As the flames progressed, residents watched smoke billow high into the air. Explosions set off by firefighters cutting fire lines periodically shook buildings. `` The town was pretty excited last night,'' <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Morris </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> spokesman in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Yellowstone </LOCATION>, said this morning. `` Things have calmed down a little. No evacuation has been ordered, but we do have an evacuation plan in case one is necessary.'' Earlier Thursday, <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION>'s south gate reopened for the first time in almost two weeks, leaving all park entrances and roads open. In eastern <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>, recreational users were banned from 3.8 million acres of state-protected land beginning today. Already closed are 2.8 million acres in western <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, lighter wind allowed firefighters breathing room on the worst of 17 blazes, but activities were restricted in several forests over the Labor Day weekend. Tight controls also were placed on campfires in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state. `` It's like sitting on a time bomb,'' said <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON>, recreation officer for the <ORGANIZATION> Sawtooth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Recreation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Area </ORGANIZATION> in central <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>. `` If we can get through this weekend without a conflagration, it will be a miracle.'' Progress was reported on two other major series of fires in northeast <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, but the forecast was for hot and dry weather over the weekend, and <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> said, `` All these fires are real worries because any one of them can blow up.'' Crews battling five forest fires in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s mountain ranges hoped to contain the blazes by today, but forest fire danger will remain high throughout the holiday weekend, they predicted. Despite tinder-dry conditions, this year's fires have been much smaller than last year's because there have n't been strong winds. <PERSON> Harley </PERSON> <PERSON> Greiman </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> warned, however, that more lightning and temperatures in the 90s in the mountains are expected during the Labor Day weekend, adding to the danger. In the Absaroka-Beartooth Wilderness along the Montana-Wyoming border, crews had to be pulled back from a fire line Thursday along a flank of a 47,200-acre fire when the blaze flared up and destroyed portions of the line. `` The fire got rolling in there and it got too hot,'' said fire information officer <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Comstock </PERSON>. `` This is the fourth day we've built good line and had to back up and let it go. In <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>, strong ridgetop winds near the Pineview Reservoir fanned a once-controlled fire into a 2,000-acre inferno threatening high-voltage lines that bring power to the Salt Lake-Ogden-Provo metropolitan area.

<TEXT>
 The Soviets are expanding naval facilities in the <LOCATION> Syrian </LOCATION> port of <LOCATION> Tartus </LOCATION> and the neighboring island of <LOCATION> Arwad </LOCATION> to counter the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> presence in the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION>, Israeli analysts said today. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s installations in <LOCATION> Tartus </LOCATION> include submarine and surface ship maintenance facilities and constitute the largest Soviet naval base in the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION>, said <ORGANIZATION> Dore </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gold </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviv </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Jaffee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Strategic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studies </ORGANIZATION>. According to <PERSON> Aharon </PERSON> <PERSON> Levran </PERSON>, editor of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Middle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> East </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Military </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Balance </ORGANIZATION> published this week by the center, the facilities extend to <LOCATION> Arwad </LOCATION> island and include recreation facilities for Soviet crews. <PERSON> Gold </PERSON> said there was no declassified information available on the current or planned size of the Soviet base but said the general trend has been one of expansion at least since 1987. In addition, the Soviets use land installations in <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> for naval and air intelligence-gathering, the two analysts said in separate interviews with The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Gold </PERSON> said that the main objective of the <LOCATION> Tartus </LOCATION> base expansion was to counter the presence of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> 6th Fleet in the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION>. The Soviets had to find new arrangements in the region after <LOCATION> Albania </LOCATION> shifted its alliance to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> in 1961 and <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> abrogated its friendship treaty with <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> in 1976, he said. He said the <LOCATION> Tartus </LOCATION> facility was important for prolonged deployment of Soviet attack submarines in the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION>. In an article published today in the English-language daily <ORGANIZATION> Jerusalem </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Gold </PERSON> noted that the London-based <PERSON> Jane </PERSON>'s Defense Weekly in May referred to <LOCATION> Tartus </LOCATION> as `` the primary maintenance facility for Soviet submarines operating in the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Levran </PERSON> said the Soviets have been using <LOCATION> Tartus </LOCATION> for at least five years and that the base's expansion apparently was a price <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> had to pay for purchasing Soviet weapons. In spite of the <ORGANIZATION> Kremlin </ORGANIZATION>'s recent reluctance to supply <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> with advanced weapons systems, he said, `` <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> is still the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s strategic asset in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>.'' He said the base replaced the Soviet practice of using <ORGANIZATION> Mediterranean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Squadron </ORGANIZATION>'s mother-ships for maintenance. But he said the base was less important than the recently developed Soviet Far Eastern base in <LOCATION> Cam </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ranh </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> navy </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Levran </PERSON> wrote in the 1987-88 <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Military </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Balance </LOCATION>, `` underwent a radical facelift'' due to supplies, training and maintenance cooperation from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. The Soviet base in <LOCATION> Tartus </LOCATION> could `` create a problem'' for <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> in wartime because <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> may be reluctant to harm a Soviet-flagged facility, he said.

<TEXT>
 A teen-ager who was named a high school cheerleader after a member of the squad died in an auto accident was dropped from the squad at the request of the dead girl's mother. The decision to remove <PERSON> Nikki </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheek </PERSON>, 14, from the junior varsity cheerleader squad has sparked controversy at <ORGANIZATION> Magoffin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Christy </PERSON> <PERSON> Michelle </PERSON> <PERSON> Caudill </PERSON>, 14, a popular cheerleader, was killed in a car-truck collision May 27 along with her 16-year-old brother and another girl. <PERSON> Nikki </PERSON> was named to replace <PERSON> Christy </PERSON>, but on July 8, county Schools Superintendent <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> <PERSON> Whitaker </PERSON> removed her from the squad at the request of <PERSON> Christy </PERSON>'s mother, <PERSON> Carrie </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Caudill </PERSON>. Mrs. <PERSON> Caudill </PERSON> said <PERSON> Whitaker </PERSON> acted out of compassion for a mother whose only children had died. <PERSON> Christy </PERSON>'s spot on the squad, she said, should be left vacant in her memory. `` It was a bad situation, a no-win situation,'' <PERSON> Whitaker </PERSON> said today. `` It's hurting both families.'' `` I know it really put him on a spot,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Caudill </PERSON>. `` God knows, I do n't want to hurt another kid, but I just think as hard as my daughter worked at it, and she's gone; in memory of her, they ought to hold it open.'' But <PERSON> Nikki </PERSON>'s mother and father, <PERSON> Patty </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheek </PERSON>, criticized the action. In a letter to the <LOCATION> Salyersville </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Independent </LOCATION>, they expressed `` deepest sympathy'' for Mrs. <PERSON> Caudill </PERSON> but said she and <PERSON> Whitaker </PERSON> had decided `` to hurt another innocent child.'' <PERSON> Nikki </PERSON> received threatening phone calls after being named to replace <PERSON> Christy </PERSON> `` saying she should n't be taking the place of a girl that was killed in the accident,'' the letter said. The letter also said <PERSON> Nikki </PERSON> attended six or seven practices before she was removed. Mrs. <PERSON> Caudill </PERSON> said she discussed the situation with Mrs. Cheek several weeks after <PERSON> Nikki </PERSON> was named a cheerleader. `` I told Mrs. Cheek that <PERSON> Nikki </PERSON> had other years she could be cheerleader,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Caudill </PERSON> said. `` <PERSON> Christy </PERSON> could not try out again.''

<TEXT>
 An <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> cadet who lost part of a leg in an auto accident faces dismissal from the academy because of a rule prohibiting amputees in the service, officials said. Cadet Second Class <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Korslund </PERSON>, 20, of <LOCATION> Tacoma </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION>, has asked that he be allowed to continue his studies and graduate with the Class of 1991 with a bachelor of science degree even though he ca n't receive an <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> commission. A medical review board is studying the case, and an official recommendation has not yet been made to <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Aldridge </PERSON>, said academy spokesman <PERSON> Will </PERSON> <PERSON> Ketterson </PERSON>. But <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> regulations prohibit anyone `` who has lost a limb, including a foot, leg or thigh,'' from military service, and therefore from academy enrollment, <PERSON> Ketterson </PERSON> said. `` It is very unlikely Cadet <PERSON> Korslund </PERSON> will return to the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Ketterson </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Korslund </PERSON> was injured in an accident June 21, and his right leg was amputated 8 inches below the knee. He was a promising defensive tackle on the academy's football team. His possible dismissal drew criticism from a handicapped rights group, which staged a protest Thursday outside the academy's chapel. Members of American Disabled for Accessible Public, many in wheelchairs, handed out leaflets protesting `` the hypocrisy of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government and the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>.'' They cited the 1973 Rehabilitation Act that prohibits any discrimination against the disabled by any agency receiving federal funds. They carried signs reading: `` <ORGANIZATION> USAF </ORGANIZATION> Academy Discriminates,'' `` Disabled and Ready to Serve'' and `` Be All You Can _ Except Disabled.'' Sen. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Armstrong </PERSON>, R-Colo., also has asked the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> to let <LOCATION> Korslund </LOCATION> stay Korslund is a patient at <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> and is expected to be transferred to a Veterans Administration hospital.

 Two gunmen took four people hostage inside a bank this morning, police said. `` Apparently they've broken a window in the back part of the bank this morning and were waiting inside for the employees to come in,'' said Officer <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>. Police surrounded the single-story granite building, and SWAT team members were posted to either side of the front door of the downtown <ORGANIZATION> Third </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> branch after the hostages were taken about 8 a.m., police said. Sgt. W.O. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said police negotiated with the gunmen by bullhorn at the back of the building. Police had been unable to reach the hostage takers by telephone. It was not known if the hostages, thought to be three women and a man, had been injured, <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> said. The curtains in the building were closed. `` What it boils down to is a give and take, just like any type of negotation situation,'' said <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>. `` You give up something to get something.''

<TEXT>
 Iranian Foreign Minister <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Akbar </PERSON> <PERSON> Velayati </PERSON> today said <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> will do its best to help win the release of the British hostages in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Velayati </PERSON> also told the <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> radio he had asked `` friendly groups'' in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> to help free the British hostages and received an affirmative reply. He spoke to the <ORGANIZATION> BBC </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>, where he is participating in peace talks in the Iran-Iraq war. In <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, the weekly magazine <ORGANIZATION> Ash-Shiraa </ORGANIZATION> reported that <ORGANIZATION> Anglican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> envoy <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Waite </PERSON>, one of the British hostages, is suffering from a severe stomach ailment. It said that could speed his release. The weekly quoted unidentified `` highly informed sources'' as saying <PERSON> Waite </PERSON>'s health had `` sharply deteriorated recently, which forced his kidnappers to call in a stomach specialist to treat him.'' `` The same sources said the sudden deterioration of <PERSON> Waite </PERSON>'s health could result in speeding up his release,'' <PERSON> Ash-Shiraa </PERSON> said The magazine gained fame when it broke the story of the secret <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> arms sales to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. But since then, its report about hostages held by pro-Iranian extremists in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> have not all been accurate. There was no way to verify the report on <PERSON> Waite </PERSON>. Many of the 18 foreigners missing in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> are believed to be held by pro-Iranian extremist groups. In addition to <PERSON> Waite </PERSON>, the British hostages are teacher <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Keenan </PERSON>, 36, who also holds Irish citizenship, and journalist <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON>, 31. The British <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> says it also seeks word on <PERSON> Alec </PERSON> <PERSON> Collett </PERSON>, a New York-based British journalist whose Palestinian abductors claim they killed him. His body was never found. <PERSON> Velayati </PERSON> said the matter `` is not in the hand of our government'' but when asked if <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> would help to get the Britons out of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, he said: `` We will do our best.'' He also said he had been informed `` unofficially and informally'' of good news, but he did not elaborate. The longest-held hostage is one of nine missing Americans, <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> Chief Middle East Correspondent <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, who was kidnapped March 16, 1985. <PERSON> Waite </PERSON>, 48, disappeared Jan. 20, 1987 after leaving a west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> hotel for a rendezvous with Islamic Jihad, an underground pro-Iranian Shiite Moslem group that holds two American hostages. No group has claimed it is holding <PERSON> Waite </PERSON>. But an anonymous telephone caller purporting to speak for Islamic Jihad, or Islamic Holy War, claimed the group is holding <PERSON> Waite </PERSON>. The claim could not be authenticated.

 <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, saying `` I want the strongest team I possibly can,'' announced today that <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sasso </PERSON>, who resigned under fire a year ago, was returning to the Democratic presidential campaign as vice chairman. `` Almost a year ago, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sasso </PERSON> made a very serious mistake,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> told a news conference. `` He's paid the price.'' <PERSON> Sasso </PERSON> resigned as campaign manager last Sept. 30 after it was disclosed he was responsible for putting together and leaking a videotape demonstrating that a rival Democratic candidate, Sen. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Biden </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION>, was using without attribution the campaign rhetoric of <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> Kinnock </PERSON>. The questioned passage came from a Kinnock speech in which he described his personal background. <PERSON> Biden </PERSON> incorporated <PERSON> Kinnock </PERSON>'s words to describe his own background <PERSON> Sasso </PERSON> resigned the day after <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> had told a news conference that no one in his campaign was involved in leaking the videotape. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said he told <PERSON> Biden </PERSON> he wanted to bring <PERSON> Sasso </PERSON> back into the campaign, and the senator `` could not have been more gracious.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> denied that <PERSON> Sasso </PERSON>'s return was linked to his decline in public opinion polls in his race against <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> nominee <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. `` I want the strongest team I possibly can,'' he said, noting that Labor Day _ next Monday _ is the traditional start of the stretch drive of the presidential campaign. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> described <PERSON> Sasso </PERSON> as `` a uniquely talented individual who can provide real strength.'' Asked if he thought <PERSON> Sasso </PERSON>'s return would blunt Democratic charges of ethical violations by members of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> replied that `` there was nothing illegal about what <PERSON> John </PERSON> did.'' As new vice chairman of the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign, <PERSON> Sasso </PERSON> will undertake unspecified duties which the candidate said were undetermined. He said <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Estrich </PERSON> would remain as campaign manager, and <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Brountas </PERSON> would continue as campaign chairman. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' announcement came as he wound up a <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> campaign swing stressing his interest in education and accusing the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration of trying to scuttle school programs. The <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor's backers said the battle for <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s crucial 47 electoral votes was `` dead even.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said Thursday that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had undergone `` an election-yar conversion on the subject of education.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was planning to continue that emphasis during appearances today in <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ore. </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Spokane </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION>, as schools open. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said the voters this fall would `` face a choice between two very different ideas of prosperity and two very different records of leadership.'' He said it was a choice `` between those who see education as a lifetime commitment and those who see it as an election year strategy.'' During the speech to teachers and school officials in <LOCATION> Oakland </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration had eliminated remedial math and reading programs for 500,000 poor children, had cut teacher retraining and `` led an assault on college loans and grants.'' By contrast, he said that in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> he had quadrupled scholarship assistance to low - and middle-income students and invested in Professional Development Centers to help teachers update their skills The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration unsuccessfully sought cuts in the remedial programs in 1981. In an April 1988 report, the <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said the number of children in remedial programs had dropped from 5 million in 1979-80 to 4.5 million in the 1985-86 school year. `` While they've invested billions in Star Wars, we've developed a regional network of star schools,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. `` And where was <PERSON> George </PERSON> when all this was going on?'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said, echoing a theme from the Democratic convention last July. `` Where was the man who now says he wants to be the ` education president'? `` He was playing hooky. He was nowhere to be found.'' Meanwhile, <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Podesta </PERSON>, who is running the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, said he now has 70 full-time employees, a number he said would grow to 500 by mid-October. `` We're going to run a field organization beyond the imagination,'' <PERSON> Podesta </PERSON> said. `` We'll have a precinct captain in every precinct in the state _ 29,000 of them.'' <PERSON> Podesta </PERSON> called the race between <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> `` dead even'' in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, an assessment also given by state Democratic Assemblyman <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Hayden </PERSON>. <PERSON> Hayden </PERSON> said <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> voters `` want change'' and that while <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> `` promises change, he's also not a wild man.'' `` <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is the most acceptable <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> candidate we've had in a very long time statewide,'' he said. `` I do n't think <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> conveys an image of change,'' <PERSON> Hayden </PERSON> said. `` He's been in office, he's the vice president, he's the establishment.'' At the same time, <PERSON> Hayden </PERSON> said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> must reassure <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> voters `` he's for stable defense spending,'' because of the large number of defense-related companies in the state.

 The expected announcement that <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> had signed papers to regain control of <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> was abruptly postponed today. <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION>'s bankruptcy trustee said Thursday that <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> was expected to sign a deal today to pay $ 165 million to buy back the TV ministry he lost in a sex-and-money scandal, and that the evangelist could be back on the air by Sept. 9.

<HEAD>Sounds of Silince: Sweden Goes Three Minutes Without Culture</HEAD>

<DATELINE>STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Pavarotti </PERSON> stayed off the stage, movies stopped in midreel, concert halls were hushed and radio programs fell silent. Cultural life in <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION> came to a halt for three minutes at 8:15 p.m. Thursday when actors, musicians, dancers, and even librarians protested what they called the low level of government support. Artists in most countries might be envious of the Swedes. <LOCATION> Stockholm </LOCATION>, capital of a country of 8.4 million people, has as many theaters as <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. Artists can get state grants, but they say it is n't enough to live on. State-supported theaters have launched the careers of director <PERSON> Ingmar </PERSON> <PERSON> Bergman </PERSON> and actors such as <PERSON> Ingrid </PERSON> <PERSON> Bergman </PERSON>, <PERSON> Max </PERSON> <PERSON> von </PERSON> <PERSON> Sydow </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ingrid </PERSON> <PERSON> Tulin </PERSON>. The nation which awards the Nobel prize for literature sells 2.5 million theater tickets a year, nearly one for every third person. In an article published Friday, actress <PERSON> Bibi </PERSON> <PERSON> Andersson </PERSON> protested that the cultural assistance were too low, projects were too vulnerable to cuts, and grants were too snagged in bureaucratic tangles. `` Why do actors have to get swallowed up in bureaucracy? Why do fiery spirits grow tired?'' she wrote in the Aftonbladet daily. `` What we wanted was to make culture an election issue,'' she said, referring to the Sept. 18 national elections. `` It's a question of priorities.'' `` The strike was a success for the artists. They got a lot of attention and managed to get their message across,'' said <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Lindbloom </PERSON>, spokesman of the <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> and Culture. In the west coast city of <LOCATION> Goteborg </LOCATION>, touring opera tenor <PERSON> Luciano </PERSON> <PERSON> Pavarotti </PERSON> delayed the start of his performance by three minutes in support of the strike. His audience stood in silence during that time. One channel of the state-run television broke into its regular program for live reports showing movie theaters with darkened screens, silent stages and a candlelight vigil in <LOCATION> Goteborg </LOCATION> by 400 people. Two radio channels were quiet, while the third played <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> and <PERSON> Garfunkel </PERSON>'s `` Sounds of Silence.'' At <LOCATION> Stockholm </LOCATION>'s National Dramatic Theater, the staging of <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Neill </PERSON>'s `` Long Day's Journey Into Night'' gave the protest a unique twist. At precisely 8:15 p.m., the young artist <PERSON> Edmund </PERSON> delivered his line, `` I'm broke.'' Action froze on stage for three minutes, then <PERSON> Edmund </PERSON>'s father resumed the play with the reply: `` You're always broke, and you always will be.'' Official figures cited by <PERSON> Lindbloom </PERSON> say national support for the arts is nearly as high in <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION> as in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, and more than anywhere else in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. Direct yearly support amounts to $ 400 million, and municipal subsidies to local cutural establishment is about $ 937 million, <PERSON> Lindbloom </PERSON> said. Together with indirect help, such as building new museums or libraries, <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION> spends about 1.5 percent of its gross national product on the arts, he told the <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. Although nothing has been trimmed from the national budget, local authorities slash cultural projects first whenever they run into trouble, complained <PERSON> Ingmar </PERSON> <PERSON> Bjorksten </PERSON>, the cultural affairs correspondent for <ORGANIZATION> Svenska </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dagbladet </ORGANIZATION>. Unemployment among artists is five times the national average of just under 2 percent, <PERSON> Bjorksten </PERSON> wrote. `` The only way for culture to get more money is to make a fuss,'' said <PERSON> Svante </PERSON> <PERSON> Weyner </PERSON>, head of <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sweden </ORGANIZATION>'s cultural division. Last year the radio cut the budget for a popular program of radio plays. The budget was restored only after <PERSON> Ingmar </PERSON> <PERSON> Bergman </PERSON> intervened.

<TEXT>
 The nearly 9-month-old rebellion against <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> has inspired new parents among the <LOCATION> Palestinians </LOCATION> to give their babies such names as Uprising, Revolution, Victory, Struggle and Sacrifice. An official at <LOCATION> Al </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ittihad </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION>, one of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>'s largest hospitals, said that of 247 births in the last two weeks in July, 20 infants were given names connected with the uprising. He cited Freedom and <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> as other new names being given Palestinian children, noting Liberation had been used for both boys and girls. But the official, who asked not to be identified, said some parents were hestitant for fear the names would not be allowed when they went to register births with <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> authorities. <PERSON> Atef </PERSON> <PERSON> Hajouj </PERSON>, of <PERSON> Bani </PERSON> <PERSON> Naim </PERSON> in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, said he ran into trouble when he named his daughter `` Intifadeh,'' the Arabic word for uprising. He said officials at the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> told him the name was illegal. `` They told me to change her name or I will be fined,'' <PERSON> Hajouj </PERSON>, 24, said in an interview. `` ` One intifadeh is enough,' they said.'' <PERSON> Hajouj </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Yussrah </PERSON>, insists the name is perfect for the child, now 5 months old. `` It's very simple. She was born in the victorious intifadeh and she deserves to be named Intifadeh,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Hajouj </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Tova </PERSON> <PERSON> Elinson </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> has no policy of preventing Palestinians from naming their children whatever they wish. `` Everyone is allowed to register newborns, no matter what his name,'' Ms. <PERSON> Elinson </PERSON> said. `` Some names may not be recorded when several are recorded at once, but that's only because the computer abbreviates them.'' <PERSON> Rabah </PERSON> <PERSON> Manasreh </PERSON>, 29, from the same village, had her first baby on April 2 and named the girl Nidaa, the Arabic word for `` appeal,'' because an uprising leaflet titled `` Appeal No. 12'' appeared that day. `` I think it was a special day so I decided to name her Appeal in memory of the intifadeh,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Manasreh </PERSON> said. `` It is the least support that I can give to the intifadeh. In <LOCATION> Bethlehem </LOCATION>, 4-month-old <PERSON> Ansar </PERSON> <PERSON> Abed </PERSON> is named for the prison where her father, <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON>, was jailed when she was born. Her 27-year-old father remains in the <LOCATION> Negev </LOCATION> desert prison camp in <LOCATION> Ketziot </LOCATION>, which Palestinians call <PERSON> Ansar </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> after an Israeli detention center at <LOCATION> Ansar </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> set up during <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s occupation of southern <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> `` It was her father's wish,'' said his wife, <PERSON> Kifayah </PERSON>. `` He sent messages through prisoners leaving the prison asking me to name the baby <PERSON> Thaher </PERSON>, the Arabic word for ` revolutionary' if it was a boy, and <PERSON> Ansar </PERSON> if it was a girl.'' `` The reason I named her <PERSON> Ansar </PERSON> is that the girl must know that when she was born her father was detained in <PERSON> Ansar </PERSON>,'' she said.

<HEAD>Galilee Fishermen Suspected Of Poisoning Fish For Easy Catch</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Thousands of dead fish were found floating on the <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, possibly poisoned by fishermen on the Sea of <LOCATION> Galilee </LOCATION> looking for an easy catch, an official said Friday. `` We suspect large-scale poisoning using agricultural pesticides,'' said <PERSON> Elad </PERSON> <PERSON> Zohar </PERSON>, an area supervisor. <PERSON> Zohar </PERSON> said the pesticides apparently were dumped in the Sea of <LOCATION> Galilee </LOCATION> and killed more fish than the fishermen could catch. Thousands of the poisoned fish then floated from the fresh water lake into the narrow, winding <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, he said. The Bible says the Sea of <LOCATION> Galilee </LOCATION> is where <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> performed his miracle of the fish and loaves, feeding 5,000 people from five barley loaves of bread and two fish. It also is where he walked on water to dispel doubts among his disciples. `` The damage caused by the poisoning is very great,'' <PERSON> Zohar </PERSON> told The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. `` For every fish caught, three others are rotting and washing ashore.'' In addition, those caught still carry the poison in their systems. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio broadcast a warning, saying fresh water fish should not be eaten. <PERSON> Zohar </PERSON> blamed the poisoning on `` marginal elements'' among the Sea of <LOCATION> Galilee </LOCATION>'s 180 commercial fishermen and said it was n't the first time it had happened. `` Poisoning usually takes place during low periods when fish are hard to catch,'' <PERSON> Zohar </PERSON> said. `` It also happens when fishermen do n't feel like going out and working. <PERSON> Zohar </PERSON> said thousands of fish died, primarily carp and <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> Peter </PERSON>'s, named after the fisherman who became an apostle of <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON>. <PERSON> Alma </PERSON> <PERSON> Avni </PERSON>, a senior <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> official, said the mass poisoning may be related to the upcoming month of holy days, including the Jewish New Year and Yom Kippur, during which fish is a popular staple. She said poisoned fish eaten in small quantities would not harm humans because it took much less poison to kill a fish than a human. But she cautioned fish-eaters `` to make certain the fish they buy comes with a certificate showing where the fish were caught and who caught them.''

<TEXT>
 A fiery <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> stepped up his attack on opponent <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' environmental record today, accusing him of trying to pollute the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> waters where sewage has washed up on the beach this summer. The Republican presidential nominee spoke on a sunny beach that in the past has been closed because of medical waste and sewage washing ashore. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> referred to the 1985 request from <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> as governor of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> to dump his state's sewage off the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> coast at a site used by <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told a few hundred supporters in beach attire that the next time <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> visits the state they should `` be sure to ask him why did you want to dump <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> sludge off our coast in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>. ... Why did you pledge a clean ocean to the people of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> when your own state applied to pollute it?'' Speaking on Thursday in <LOCATION> Norwalk </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, of what he called the `` natural heritage that we all have to do something about,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> called himself a ` Teddy Roosevelt Republican'' on the environment. <PERSON> Roosevelt </PERSON> was an avid conservationist responsible for setting aside millions of acres of forests and launching irrigation and reclamation projects. Aware that Republicans and the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration in particular are a target of unrelenting criticism by environmental groups, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> declared nonetheless, `` We're not going to give this constituency away to the Democrats.'' He recalled his acceptance speech at the Republican convention last month when he said he wanted to make the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> `` a gentler nation.'' `` This is part of what I mean, a nation in which all of us treat the environment with greater reverence and greater respect,'' he said. Today <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was continuing his effort to pull votes from the environmentally-minded with speeches to residents of <LOCATION> Belmar </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> and later in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Castle </LOCATION>, Del. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> sought to embarrass <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> on a day when the <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION> headlined a new poll that put him neck-and-neck with the governor in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>. `` Fantastic,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said when reporters showed him the newspaper. `` I ca n't believe it,'' he said. `` In <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>?'' The <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION> survey found <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> tied in the state at 42 percent each. The poll of 400 likely voters conducted Wednesday had a 5-point margin of error. A poll for the <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION> in July found <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> leading by 14 percentage points. In his <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION> tour, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> laid the fault on <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> for failing to clean up the harbor, which has become a major embarrassment to the state, with half a billion gallons of raw sewage being dumped in daily. Construction of new wastewater treatment facilities is now beginning under federal court order. He said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> had been intent on delay, to do `` anything but clean up'' the sewage and sludge and twice sought federal waivers of the Clean Air Act requirement for secondary treatment of sewage. `` I do n't call that leadership, and I certainly do n't call that competence,'' he said in reference to <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' statement that voters should look for competence in this presidential race. In his first term as governor <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> prepared a waiver request to the federal government, but it actually was filed by his successor Gov. Ed King in 1979. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> filed the second waiver request in 1984. In 1985, the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> sued the state to force a cleanup. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also criticized <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> for promising to end the dumping that has left medical waste cluttering <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> beaches, when <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> himself as governor asked for federal permission to dump waste off <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>. `` The stealth candidate is at it again, making promises on one hand but hiding his secret record on the other,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. The 1985 <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> request to the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> was for temporary permission to dump 106 miles offshore where <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> were already dumping. A compromise arrangement allowed <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> to dump further out beyond the continental shelf. Standing on a <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> ferry boat off of <LOCATION> Deer </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, the future site of a new sewage treatment plant near the harbor mouth, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> called for a ban on ocean dumping of sewage sludge after 1991, and for greater <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> efforts and <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> participation in catching violators.

 <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>'s first legal privately owned newspaper in 26 years began publishing Friday, and it said it would present the `` true and unbiased news.'' In its four pages, the People's View printed photographs and accounts of demonstrations in <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> against the authoritarian government, and of student protests last month outside the Burmese embassies in <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION>. It also carried the full text of President <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> <PERSON> Maung </PERSON>'s address to the nation Thursday in which he rejected calls for an interim government to lead <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION> back to democracy, which ended with a military coup in 1962. <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> View </ORGANIZATION> said it would be enlarged and carry foreign news when conditions improved, and declared in its first editorial: `` Under the current conditions of scarcity of newsprint, ink and other materials, the first privately owned newspaper is published to cater to the people with true and unbiased news of the prevailing situation.'' It did not editorialize about the political turmoil in <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>. No price was printed on the front page, but People's View was selling for up to 34 cents, several times the cost of the generally distrusted government newspapers. The new morning paper's owner and publisher is <PERSON> Kyaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Nyein </PERSON> and the editor is Tun Tha, sports editor of the government-run newspaper <PERSON> Kyemon </PERSON>. People's View is licensed by the government but not controlled by it. <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION>'s six other dailies, two in English four in <LOCATION> Burmese </LOCATION>, are owned by the government. Twenty-one privately owned newspapers were published in <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> before the coup by Gen. <PERSON> Ne </PERSON> <PERSON> Win </PERSON>, who nationalized all newspapers, radio stations and television stations. <PERSON> Aye </PERSON> <PERSON> Ko </PERSON>, vice chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, told the legislature Aug. 19 the government would permit privately run newspapers, journals and magazines so as to `` provide an opportunity to bring out the people's wants and desires and accurate news about what's happening at work places and in regions. <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> assumed power the same day as the first civilian leader since Ne Win's military coup. Ne Win resigned late in July and was succeeded by <PERSON> Sein </PERSON> <PERSON> Lwin </PERSON>, a hard-line former general, who was driven from office in 17 days by huge protests against 26 years of isolation and economic disaster. Employees of the government newspapers went on strike last month, demanding greater press freedom, and kept the newspapers off the streets for three days. They returned to work Aug. 28, saying they had been assured their demands would be met. Several unauthorized newspapers have appeared, poorly printed but selling for up to $ 1.

<TEXT>
 An advertising executive who succeeded in getting his Russian wife and 1-year-old son out of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> was convicted today of assaulting them nine days after they arrived in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Kirby </PERSON> <PERSON> Inwood </PERSON> was found guilty of assault causing bodily harm on his wife and of common assault on the boy. Assault carries a maximum sentence of 10 years in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> but offenders are often sentenced to six months or less. Provincial court Judge <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> Hachborn </PERSON> rendered his verdict following a sensational trial that involved tales of sex, greed and violence. <PERSON> Inwood </PERSON>, 44, of <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION>, maintained throughout the trial that his wife, <PERSON> Tanya </PERSON> <PERSON> Sidorova </PERSON>, was a money hungry `` Russian yuppie'' who lured him into marriage to get out of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. He said she fabricated a story of the assault as a way to end their marriage. Ms. <PERSON> Sidorova </PERSON>, 32, told of a vicious beating in which she was punched, kicked, choked and thrown barely conscious from her <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION> home. She said her son, <PERSON> Misha </PERSON>, was also assaulted by a drunken <LOCATION> Inwood </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Hachborn </PERSON> said he felt Ms. <PERSON> Sidorova </PERSON> was exaggerating. But he said he had concluded that <PERSON> Inwood </PERSON> `` was fabricating his evidence. I came to believe that the more I heard him testify.'' <PERSON> Hachborn </PERSON> said there was `` an aura of unreality about what the accused said occurred between him and his wife.'' The trial attracted daily headlines and drew crowds to the courtroom. At one point, women's groups picketed the courthouse, alleging battered women could n't get a fair shake in the justice system. <PERSON> Inwood </PERSON> testified he and Ms. <PERSON> Sidorova </PERSON> slept together the day they met in <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION> in 1986. But he questioned whether <PERSON> Misha </PERSON> was his child, testifying he was often impotent. The couple married soon after Christmas 1986 and <PERSON> Misha </PERSON> was born in September 1987. But the Soviet government refused to let Ms. <PERSON> Sidorova </PERSON> emigrate to <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, claiming she was a security risk. That began a yearlong campaign by <LOCATION> Inwood </LOCATION>, during which he spent thousands of dollars lobbying government officials in both countries and pleaded in the press for her release. When <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> relented, <PERSON> Inwood </PERSON> said he was `` deliriously happy.'' `` I felt like the white knight rescuing the fairy princess,'' he said at his trial. But the fairy tale turned into a horror story. <PERSON> Inwood </PERSON> said Ms. <PERSON> Sidorova </PERSON> changed as soon as she arrived in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>. He said she criticized his home and an emerald ring he gave her and pressured him to buy her a Corvette and a fur coat. Ms. <PERSON> Sidorova </PERSON> painted a picture of <LOCATION> Inwood </LOCATION> as an abusive, violent man who threatened to kill her and <PERSON> Misha </PERSON>. On the night <PERSON> Inwood </PERSON> was arrested, she testified, he `` beat me like a wild animal, like a beast.'' Sentencing arguments were being held following announcement of the verdict.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> should order <ORGANIZATION> Toyota </ORGANIZATION> to directly notify owners of secret warranties on cars made by the Japanese company, the Center for Auto Safety said in a petition filed Friday. `` The Toyota documents clearly show that the company has an internal policy that systematically reimburses consumers for failure of specific components beyond the written warranty,'' said <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Cole </PERSON> of the center, a consumers group often critical of the automakers and their regulators. `` Certainly ... every <ORGANIZATION> Toyota </ORGANIZATION> owner should be made aware,'' of the policy, he said. An internal <ORGANIZATION> Toyota </ORGANIZATION> document, published last month by The <ORGANIZATION> Detroit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION>, listed 41 components for which <ORGANIZATION> Toyota </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sales </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION> could be reimbursed by its Japanese parent company. The document said an attachment was a `` complete ` Secret Warranty' listing.'' After the document was published, <ORGANIZATION> Toyota </ORGANIZATION> said the listing referred to reimbusement beyond the normal warranties under the company's customer satisfaction policy rather than to secret warranties. The center a year ago asked the <ORGANIZATION> FTC </ORGANIZATION> to require all manufacturers to disclose secret warranties.

 Democrat <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, trying to regain momentum for his presidential campaign, said today he was rehiring former campaign aide <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sasso </PERSON> because `` I want the strongest team I possibly can'' for the battle against <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> nominee <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> meanwhile appeared before vacationers on the sands of <LOCATION> Belmar </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, to press his attack on <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' environmental record as <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, he said, `` fought to allow <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> sludge to be dumped off <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>'s shore _ the very shore on which he had the nerve to stand and promise clean water.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> added sarcastically: `` Nice guy.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, winding up a campaign swing through the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION>, announced in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jose </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, that he was bringing back the former campaign manager who had resigned last Sept. 30 after <PERSON> Sasso </PERSON> admitted helping torpedo the campaign of party rival <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Biden </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said <PERSON> Sasso </PERSON>, who will be vice chairman of his campaign, was `` a uniquely talented individual who can provide real strength.'' The governor denied that <PERSON> Sasso </PERSON>'s return was linked to <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' recent decline in public opinion polls in his race against <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> A <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> plans to announce that former campaign manager <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sasso </PERSON> will return to the campaign as vice chairman. <PERSON> Sasso </PERSON> had previously engineered <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>'s successful campaign to recapture the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governorship after a term out of office, and directed <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>'s presidential campaign until he resigned in September 1987. <PERSON> Sasso </PERSON> left after admitting that he circulated a videotape demonstrating <PERSON> Biden </PERSON> had borrowed without attribution some deeply personal remarks by British politician <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> Kinnock </PERSON>. Only two days earlier, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said he had been assured no one on his campaign staff was the source of the video tape. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> took advantage of the timely concerns _ the opening of school and a summer haunted by the specter of waste-strewn shorelines _ to go after voters before the official Labor Day opening of the campaign season. `` While they've invested billions in Star Wars, we've developed a regional network of star schools,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said Thursday in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> while contrasting his achievements as <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor with the inaction of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration. `` Where was the man who now says he wants to be the ` education president'?'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Oakland </LOCATION>. `` He was playing hooky. He was nowhere to be found.'' He charged the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration has eliminated remedial math and reading programs for 500,000 poor children, cut teacher retraining, and `` led an assault on college loans and grants.'' He said that in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> he had quadrupled scholarship assistance to low - and middle-income students and invested in Professional Development Centers to help teachers update their skills The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration sought cuts in the remedial programs in 1981 but was unsuccessful. In an April 1988 report, the <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said the number of children in remedial programs had dropped from 5 million in 1979-80 to 4.5 million in the 1985-86 school year. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was planning to continue that emphasis during appearances today in <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ore. </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Spokane </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION>, as he courts the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> Democrats _ Democrats who voted Republican in the 1980 and 1984 presidential elections. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, after a rally Thursday into <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' backyard, where he charged the governor failed to act swiftly against pollution in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION>, continued his campaign as a `` lifelong environmentalist'' on the <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> shores. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> called <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s newfound commitment an `` election-year conversion.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also criticized <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> for promising to end the dumping that has left medical waste cluttering <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> beaches, when <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> himself as governor asked for federal permission to dump waste off <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>. `` The stealth candidate is at it again, making promises on one hand but hiding his secret record on the other,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. The 1985 <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> request to the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> was for temporary permission to dump 106 miles offshore where <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> were dumping already. A compromise arrangement allowed <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> to dump farther out beyond the continental shelf. Speaking in <LOCATION> Norwalk </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> called himself a `` Teddy Roosevelt Republican'' on the environment. <PERSON> Roosevelt </PERSON> was an avid conservationist responsible for setting aside millions of acres of forests and launching irrigation and reclamation projects. Aware that Republicans and the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration in particular are a target of unrelenting criticism by environmental groups, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> declared nonetheless, `` We're not going to give this constituency away to the Democrats.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s incursion in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> was more than physical. A <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION> poll released published Thursday showed he and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> to be neck and neck in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>. `` Fantastic,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, when given the news. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, meanwhile, was reported today to be resurrecting his fallen campaign manager, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sasso </PERSON>, who resigned last year after it was revealed that he provided videotapes to the news media showing Sen. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Biden </PERSON>, D-Del., The <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION> survey found <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> tied in the state at 42 percent each The poll of 400 likely voters conducted Wednesday had a five percentage point margin of error. A poll for the <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION> in July found <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> leading by 14 percentage points. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Dayton </PERSON> <PERSON> Duncan </PERSON> countered: `` We're very confident <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> will carry <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>. We're also confident he will carry <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s other home states: <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, and any others he claims.'' <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> for a meeting to plan voter registration strategy, tried to put an end to reports that tension was rising between his supporters and the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> camp. `` I would hate to wake up on the morning of Nov. 9 -LRB- the day after the election -RRB- and hate to think that we lost by the lack of my work,'' he said, promising to campaign for the ticket and the party in general. Republican vice presidential nominee, Sen. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, continued his Southern swing today after touring a watch plant in <LOCATION> Little </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rock </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ark. </LOCATION>, and watching a high school football practice in <LOCATION> Jackson </LOCATION>, Miss. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> was asked at one point about a forthcoming article in The <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> which said a public relations firm run by <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s campaign manager, <PERSON> Stuart </PERSON> <PERSON> Spencer </PERSON>, was paid $ 350,000 in 1984-85 to lobby for <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> ruler Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> Advance copies of the article say the firm lobbied against drug investigations of <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> and defended him against allegations of killing former president Dr. <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON> <PERSON> Spadafora </PERSON> in September 1985. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said he did not `` know about the specifics'' of the story. `` From my observation, <PERSON> Stuart </PERSON> <PERSON> Spencer </PERSON> is a political pro,'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said. The Democratic vice presidential nominee, Sen. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, was on vacation.

<HEAD>Israeli Analysts Say Soviets Expanding Tartus-Arwad Base</HEAD>

<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The Soviets are expanding naval facilities in the <LOCATION> Syrian </LOCATION> port of <LOCATION> Tartus </LOCATION> and the neighboring island of <LOCATION> Arwad </LOCATION> to counter the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> presence in the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION>, Israeli analysts said Friday. Soviet installations in <LOCATION> Tartus </LOCATION>, including submarine and surface ship maintenance facilities, constitute the largest Soviet naval base in the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION>, said <ORGANIZATION> Dore </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gold </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviv </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Jaffee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Strategic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studies </ORGANIZATION> <PERSON> Aharon </PERSON> <PERSON> Levran </PERSON>, editor of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Middle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> East </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Military </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Balance </ORGANIZATION> published this week by the center, said the facilities extend to <LOCATION> Arwad </LOCATION> island and include recreation facilities for Soviet crews. <PERSON> Gold </PERSON> said no declassified information was available on the current or planned size of the Soviet base, but that the general and continuing trend has been expansion since 1987. He said the Soviet navy's <ORGANIZATION> Mediterranean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Squadron </ORGANIZATION> is using <LOCATION> Tartus </LOCATION>, about 200 miles north of <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION>, because it is outside <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> territory and has good access to the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION>. The Soviets use other land installations in <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> for intelligence-gathering, Gold and <PERSON> Levran </PERSON> said in separate interviews. <PERSON> Gold </PERSON> said the main objective of the <LOCATION> Tartus </LOCATION> base expansion was to counter the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> 6th Fleet presence in the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has bases in <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> had to find new arrangements after <LOCATION> Albania </LOCATION> shifted its alliance to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> in 1961 and <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> dropped its friendship treaty with <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> in 1976, he said. <PERSON> Gold </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> Tartus </LOCATION> facility was important for prolonged deployment of Soviet attack submarines in the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION>. The London-based <PERSON> Jane </PERSON>'s Defense Weekly in May called <LOCATION> Tartus </LOCATION> `` the primary maintenance facility for Soviet submarines operating in the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Levran </PERSON> said the Soviets have been using <LOCATION> Tartus </LOCATION> for at least five years and that the base's expansion apparently was a price <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> had to pay for purchasing Soviet weapons. Despite the <ORGANIZATION> Kremlin </ORGANIZATION>'s recent reluctance to supply <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> with advanced weapons systems, he said, `` <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> is still the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s strategic asset in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>.'' He said the base replaced the Soviet practice of using <ORGANIZATION> Mediterranean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Squadron </ORGANIZATION> ships for maintenance. But he said the base was less important than the recently developed Soviet Far Eastern base in <LOCATION> Cam </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ranh </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>.

 Saturday's election in <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION> will pass the torch of leadership to a younger generation, but the man who has led this prosperous Asian city-state since 1959 is not expected to retire. The governing <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> is expected to win the parliamentary election by a big margin. Prime Minister <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Kuan </PERSON> <PERSON> Yew </PERSON>, who will be 65 on Sept. 16, is expected to step down in favor of First Deputy Prime Minister <PERSON> Goh </PERSON> <PERSON> Chok </PERSON> <PERSON> Tong </PERSON>, 46. <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>, who called the election `` truly a watershed,'' has been prime minister since 1959 and more than half of the 2.6 million people have known no other leader. He is to remain secretary-general of the <ORGANIZATION> PAP </ORGANIZATION> and, although he has expressed disinterest, is still regarded as the most logical candidate to be the country's first elected president. `` Those who believe that when I have left the government as prime minister, that I have gone into permanent retirement, really should have their heads examined,'' <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> said recently. The proposed elected presidency remained the key issue as the nine-day campaign wound down Friday. It would replace the current appointed ceremonial post with a president holding veto power over spending the nation's ample financial reserves and nominations to senior civil service and judicial positions. Even the most optimistic of opposition leaders do not expect to be able to muster enough votes to form a government. The <ORGANIZATION> Singapore </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> under <PERSON> Chaim </PERSON> <PERSON> See </PERSON> <PERSON> Tong </PERSON>, the only opposition member when the last <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> was dissolved, would settle for denying the <ORGANIZATION> PAP </ORGANIZATION> the two-thirds majority needed to amend the Constitution. `` Save democracy now. Deny them two-thirds,'' is the slogan for the party's 18 candidates. The biggest opposition challenge was posed by the Workers' Party, which fielded 32 candidates But Secretary-General <PERSON> J.B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jeyaretnam </PERSON>, who won election with <PERSON> Chaim </PERSON> at the last polls in 1984, was disqualified from <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> for five years from 1986 for falsifying party accounts. The <ORGANIZATION> PAP </ORGANIZATION> won 77 of the 79 seats in 1984 but was shocked by a 12.6 percent drop in total popular vote to 62.9 percent. The opposition gain was attributed to several issues, including a proposal to bar the withdrawal of savings from the Central Provident Fund, a mandatory Social Security-like program, at age 55. Senior party officials now make regular `` walkabouts'' to press the flesh and sample public opinion. Controversial proposals, such as the elected presidency, are no longer rammed through <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> on the strength of a two-thirds majority. The party has tried to lure voters by promising welfare recipients more money and recommending wage increases after two years of official restraint caused by recession. Parents were told they may use Central Provident Fund savings to finance college educations for their children. The national day celebrations this month were made extra festive with a government-sanctioned street party that attracted 250,000 revelers. `` More good years'' is the <ORGANIZATION> PAP </ORGANIZATION> slogan. The party takes credit for a booming economy that generated 11.2 percent growth in inflation-adjusted terms in the first half of the year. Singaporeans enjoy one of the highest living standards in <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>, and 86 percent of them live in apartments built by a government that is is generally perceived to be efficient and relatively free of corruption. The recently enlarged unicameral <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> now has 81 seats, and the legislators serve five-year terms. The <ORGANIZATION> PAP </ORGANIZATION> already has 11 seats where it was running unopposed. The <ORGANIZATION> PAP </ORGANIZATION> needs to win at least 30 more seats to get a simple majority of 41 to form a new government and run the country for the eighth consecutive term since 1959. It faces 141 candidates from seven opposition parties and four independents. Opposition candidates numbered only 51 in the last election. There are 42 traditional single-member voting districts. But for the first time, each party competing in 13 constituencies had to nominate three candidates, at least one of them from a minority group. Voters select a team of three and each gets a separate vote in <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION>'s 2 million people are 76 percent ethnic Chinese, about 15 percent Malay and six percent Indians. Voting is compulsory for the 1.5 million eligible voters in the 70 contested districts. Voting hours Saturday are from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m., with results expected about midnight.

 Sen. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> attacked <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> nominee <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> on Friday as `` flat wrong'' on defense and foreign policy issues, and promised that <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> candidate <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will be the American farmer's friend. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, who is <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s vice presidential running mate told an <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> audience that farmers should not have to compete against `` illegal subsidies'' that lower the prices of goods produced overseas. `` As long as we can get that level playing field, the American farmer will out-produce and be more competitive than any farmers in the world,'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said. If the <ORGANIZATION> Bush-Quayle </ORGANIZATION> ticket is elected in November, he said, `` we're going to put the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> on the side of the farmer instead being on the side of the trading partners.'' In a blast at <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said the Republican and Democratic candidates disagree most sharply in their approach to national defense. `` We believe in a strong national defense to deter aggression against <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, and he does not,'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said. `` On matters of national defense and foreign policy, believe me, our opponent is not even half right. He's just flat wrong,'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said. He said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> needed `` some education about the defense of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'' because of his opposition to the Star Wars space-based missile defense system, the MX missile and other deterrent weapons systems backed by the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration. `` <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> needs an education _ that's for sure. But the people ... are not about to let him get his on-the-job training in the Oval Office at the expense of our security,'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s schedule called for a visit to <LOCATION> Orlando </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, for a student rally at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION>, a <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> fund-raising event and a tour of a laser research facility.

<HEAD>Downtown Seattle Power Outage Extended to Saturday</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>'s worst-ever power outage will keep many downtown businesses and apartment houses in the dark into the Labor Day weekend, officials said. Utility officials Thursday said replacement of thousands of feet of fire-damaged cable was taking more time than expected. <PERSON> Julia </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenlee </PERSON>, a City Light spokeswoman, said the expected time for restoring electricity to the 40-block area had been pushed back from tonight or Saturday morning to Saturday afternoon or evening. `` Maybe we were being too optimistic in our original estimate,'' Ms. <PERSON> Greenlee </PERSON> said. A smoky fire of undetermined origin wrecked an underground vault containing two transformers and switching equipment Wednesday, cutting electricity to much of the city's retail, financial and hotel core and closing numerous businesses. Many restaurants that tried to stay open with limited service were closed by health inspectors concerned about food spoilage and potential sanitation problems. `` I probably closed 15 to 20 places myself,'' said <PERSON> Janet </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderberg </PERSON>, senior environmental health specialist with the <ORGANIZATION> Seattle-King </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. `` We had places that were cooking with candles and washing their hands without hot water.'' No serious injuries have been reported, nor were there any reports of looting as police increased patrols in the area. At <ORGANIZATION> Stewart </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, residents pooled the contents of defrosting refrigerators and held a barbecue in the courtyard for low-income elderly and disabled residents. Generators were provided by City Light for five hotels with a large share of elderly residents. About 70 City Light workers labored through the night Thursday, Ms. <PERSON> Greenlee </PERSON> said. Authorities have refused to estimate the number of affected businesses, workers and residents, dozens of whom have been relocated until power is restored. <PERSON> Isabel </PERSON> <PERSON> Boldrin </PERSON>, 87, said she walked down 23 flights from her place in a 26-story condominium to wash at a department store just outside the outage area. The power failure left her without elevator service, and residents of the upper 22 floors also were without water, she said. The almost complete blackout of banks in the area could leave many residents who rely on government checks short of cash over the Labor Day weekend. `` I talked to a lot of people today who were down to counting their dimes and quarters,'' said the Rev. <PERSON> Carol </PERSON> <PERSON> Ludden </PERSON>, `` and you ca n't go out to eat on dimes and quarters.''

 Hundreds of thousands of <LOCATION> Burmese </LOCATION> demonstrated for immediate democracy Friday and dissident leaders called for more protests, rejecting President <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> <PERSON> Maung </PERSON>'s pledge of a referendum on one-party rule. A Western diplomat said he had reports that students, <ORGANIZATION> Buddhist </ORGANIZATION> monks and others had taken over about 40 town governments because of continued strikes, demonstrations and defections of officials. In <LOCATION> Moulmein </LOCATION>, the Mon state capital 50 miles east of <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION>, a resident said the government had been paralyzed since early August by strikes of city employees. The report said an 11-member committee formed by the state's <ORGANIZATION> Buddhist </ORGANIZATION> monk organization was running the city and citizen patrols handled security More than 10,000 striking government employees in <LOCATION> Moulmein </LOCATION> rallied Friday against <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> <PERSON> Maung </PERSON>'s referendum plan, denouncing it as an attempt to prolong the 26-year rule of the <ORGANIZATION> Burma </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Program </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. About 300,000 people, including striking government workers and policemen, held a rally for democracy in <LOCATION> Monywa </LOCATION> and rejected the president's plea for a return to work, a resident said. The city is 400 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> expressed sympathy with the protesters in a speech Thursday, but said he must respect constitutional procedures and can not bow to demands for an interim government. He said the party leadership would meet Sept. 12 to consider holding a referendum on one-party rule that could lead to a multiparty system. Protesters from all segments of society blame the party, which a military coup brought to power in 1962, for brutal repression and for rigid socialist policies that have visited economic ruin on a nation rich in natural resources. The Western diplomat said of the reaction to <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> <PERSON> Maung </PERSON>'s speech: `` They think it's not enough They can not trust the government to carry out its promise.'' He said protesters were calling for large-scale demonstrations Sept. 8, but strikes and protests already are daily events and it was not clear what more could be done. Former Defense Minister Tin Oo, a leading dissident, said Friday: `` It is no longer necessary to hold a referendum. The whole country has rejected one-party rule. Only an interim government will be able to reactivate the stalled administration and ease the situation.'' Similar responses came from the new League for Democracy and Peace, made up by elder statesmen and military officers led by former President <PERSON> Win </PERSON> <PERSON> Maung </PERSON>, and the <ORGANIZATION> Rangoon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lawyers </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, a government-sponsored group. A statement by the lawyers said the shooting of demonstrators and indefinite detention of suspects last month violated the constitution. `` It is ridiculous to talk about constitutionality by the government that has violated the constitution on various occasions,'' the statement said. `` The national sentiment against one-party rule is evident by demonstrations throughout the nation.'' <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> said Thursday the government would legalize student unions, banned since 1962, and rebuild the <ORGANIZATION> Rangoon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Student </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Building </ORGANIZATION>, which the army destroyed in suppressing dissent that year. About 3,000 students, rejecting that, marched through <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION>'s streets in the green dress-like school uniforms called longyis Among them were children of kindergarten age. With thousands of other marchers, including government workers, the young Burmese shouted: `` The students' cause and the people's cause are indivisible! A 17-year-old student leader called <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> <PERSON> Maung </PERSON>'s speech `` a cunning trick to divide students from the people,'' and declared: `` We will continue to demonstrate until the one-party regime is replaced by a democratic regime.'' Friday's rallies in <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> were peaceful and far fewer people participated than the estimated 100,000 who turned out the day before. A Western diplomat in <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> said he believes former ruler Ne Win will flee <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>. On Thursday, a senior officer of the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> said members of his entourage had tried to transfer 18 million kyats -LRB- $ 3 million -RRB- to <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> but the bank refused. Ne Win led the 1962 military coup, and after 26 years of rule resigned July 23, taking indirect responsibility for student-led riots in March and June. <PERSON> Sein </PERSON> <PERSON> Lwin </PERSON>, a hard-line former general, succeded him and protests followed. At least 112 people were killed in <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> alone, by official count, but unofficial reports put the toll much higher. After 17 days <PERSON> Sein </PERSON> <PERSON> Lwin </PERSON> resigned and was replaced by <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> <PERSON> Maung </PERSON>, the first civilian leader since 1962.

 A passenger train carrying more than 150 people derailed today, and three of its cars tumbled down a steep embankment, killing six people, police said. A police spokesman said 29 people were injured, including two Americans and at least 13 other foreign tourists. Earlier, police reported seven people were killed. The police spokesman, who spoke on condition of anonymity in accordance with <LOCATION> Greek </LOCATION> practice, said the train was on its way from <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Patras </LOCATION> in western <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION>. The six-car train derailed along a rocky coastline near this resort area 35 miles west of <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION>. `` We were going along and suddenly the train started falling. I fell through the window and broke my arm, that's all I can remember,'' a 23-year-old Czech passenger said from his hosptial bed. The six victims and many of the injured had been sitting in the two end cars, a medic at the scene told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. `` Many of the passengers were crushed to death after they were flung out of the windows. There were dismembered pieces of bodies all over the place,'' said the medic, who declined to give his name. Several of the injured were reported to be suffering from shock. The police spokesman said the injured foreigners included seven Britons, two Czechs, two Spaniards, an Argentine and a Finn. None were in serious condition except for the Finnish woman, who suffered a broken back.

 Scrawling your <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Hancock </PERSON> across the back of a paycheck may not be enough to get it cashed anymore, no matter how large your bank account or how well you know your teller. A new federal law guaranteeing customers faster access to their deposits includes little-known, uniform standards for endorsing checks. Under the regulations, which took effect Thursday, all endorsements must be within a 1 -LCB- - inch section along the edge of the back of the check so they do n't interfere with endorsements from the bank at which the check is deposited Only `` appropriate color ink,'' such as blue and black, may be used by banks for their endorsements, according to the regulations administered by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>. Financial institutions say they have been training employees and mailing out brochures with diagrams to educate customers on the new standards. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Hutchinson </PERSON>, a senior vice president from <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hanover </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, said there have been few problems so far. `` I'm unaware of any excessive long lines,'' he said. `` -LRB- But -RRB- let's be honest, there's going to be an adjustment period. It's going to take time for everyone to understand and adjust to the rules. Some bank employees said privately they were bracing for a few initial headaches. Incorrect customer endorsements, they said, could delay check clearing and might affect subsequent transactions based on money derived from that check. `` It wo n't be the bank's problem; it's the customer's problem. But we'll be hearing about it,'' said one branch manager of a large New York-based bank. Stores also have had to adjust to the new guidelines. Many businesses routinely stamp the backs of checks with a lengthy list of identification items store clerks must obtain from customers. As a result, stores have had to buy new rubber stamps or reprogram cash registers to print within the smaller endorsement area. The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> has defended the new requirements as necessary to speed check-clearing so that bounced checks can be returned quickly to the institution where they were cashed. The new rules require financial institutions to give customers access to deposited funds within one, three or seven days, depending on the type of check. Consumer groups had complained that too many banks were holding funds for periods as long as two or three weeks before making the money available to the depositor, a practice that cost Americans millions of dollars in interest.

 <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s health is excellent and the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> vice presidential candidate suffers only from slightly high cholesterol levels and minor skin and nasal problems, a doctor's report released <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s office said Friday. Based on an Aug. 1 examination and a study of the <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> senator's medical and family history, Dr. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Krasner </PERSON>, senior assistant attending physician at the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Capitol </ORGANIZATION>, pronounced <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> healthy. `` In summary, you are a 41-year-old white male in excellent health without any active problems,'' <PERSON> Krasner </PERSON> wrote in a letter to <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> dated Aug. 29. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s cholesterol level of 228 is `` marginally elevated'' and can be reduced by proper diet and exercise, <PERSON> Krasner </PERSON> wrote. The senator rides a stationary bicycle one to three times weekly and does not smoke, the report said. The doctor said <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> suffers from a minor nosebleeding problem and an unspecified seasonal allergy that causes nasal swelling, for which he uses a nasal spray. The senator also has a slight skin condition on his face caused by exposure to the sun. He treats the skin condition, called actinic keratosis, with liquid nitrogen. The doctor recommended that <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> have the condition examined periodically and that he use a sun screen. The candidate had a small rectal tear in the past, but the August examination found no evidence of the problem persisting. <PERSON> Krasner </PERSON> suggested an anal examination within the next year. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> is 5 feet 10 inches tall, weighs 176 -LCB- pounds, has 20-20 vision and had a precisely normal temperature reading of 98.6 degrees, the report said. The senator's office released <PERSON> Krasner </PERSON>'s letter and summaries of the doctor's findings and the laboratory results.

 `` The A-Team'' fought its last battle on television years ago but won another one in court in a copyright suit by the writer of an unsuccessful TV pilot about another crew of <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> vets. The 9th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday upheld a judge's ruling that <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> had not copied the action-adventure series from a screenplay called `` Cargo'' by <PERSON> Ernest </PERSON> <PERSON> Olson </PERSON>. <PERSON> Olson </PERSON>'s script involved three <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> veterans who had conducted scams during the war and were looking to continue them in civilian life over the opposition of their former superior officers, who had become corrupt drug agents. `` The A-Team'' involved the adventures of four <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> vets, three of whom were unjustly court-martialed in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, escaped from prison and were on the run. Its stars included Mr. T and <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Peppard </PERSON>. A federal jury in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> found that the series was substantially similar to `` Cargo'' and that <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> had access to <PERSON> Olson </PERSON>'s work before putting on `` The A-Team.'' But the judge overruled the jury, finding no substantial similarity. In a 3-0 decision, the appeals court said the two works were action-adventure series designed to show <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> veterans in a favorable light, and there was some resemblance between the leading characters. But the court said the similarities fell far short of the evidence needed for copyright infringement. The court noted also that <PERSON> Olson </PERSON> had defined the characters in `` Cargo'' with descriptions of only a few lines each.

 An explosion rocked downtown <LOCATION> Durban </LOCATION> just after the evening rush hour today, extensively damaging a clothing store and slightly injuring a black woman, police said. In other cities, a hand grenade was tossed at the home of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s leading mixed-race politician, and a bomb exploded in a post office, but no injuries were reported in those attacks. Glass and concrete littered one of <LOCATION> Durban </LOCATION>'s main streets following the 5:45 p.m. blast, witnesses said. The explosion occurred inside a street-level clothing store, causing major damage to the shop and two adjacent stores, witnesses said. The street was largely deserted at the time of the explosion, but had been full of traffic less than an hour earlier. Police initially said no one was hurt, but later said a black woman suffered minor injuries. The grenade attack in the <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Province </LOCATION> town of Uitenhage damaged a parked car but did not hit the house of Rev. <PERSON> Allan </PERSON> <PERSON> Hendrickse </PERSON>. The mine exploded inside a package at the post office in <LOCATION> Stranderton </LOCATION>, southeast of <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION>. No group immediately claimed responsibility for any of the attacks. More than 100 bombings have been reported in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> under the 26-month state of emergency. Police have blamed virtually all of the attacks on the outlawed <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, the main black group fighting to overthrow the white-dominated government. On Wednesday, a bombing destroyed a <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION> office building used by anti-apartheid groups and explosions Thursday in <LOCATION> Windhoek </LOCATION>, the capital of <LOCATION> South-West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. Two people were killed and 15 injured Thursday when a bomb went off at a hotel in <LOCATION> Windhoek </LOCATION>, the capital of <LOCATION> South-West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, and a mine exploded later alongside a railroad track near the city in the South African-ruled territory. No injuries were reported in the railroad bombing. Officials earlier had said two people were injured. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s chief representative in the territory, <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Pienaar </PERSON>, blamed the hotel bombing on pro-independence guerrillas of the <ORGANIZATION> South-West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>. But <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION>, which began observing a voluntary cease-fire Thursday, denied the allegation and blamed it on `` <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s dirty tactics.'' Political and community leaders have expressed fears that the attacks signal an escalation of retaliatory attacks by anti-apartheid militants and by right-wing extremists. <PERSON> Hendrickse </PERSON>, leader of the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> that controls the mixed-race chamber of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, was not at his home when the grenade exploded about 1:05 a.m., but two of his children were in the house. Anti-apartheid activists have criticized <PERSON> Hendrickse </PERSON> for agreeing to mixed-race participation in the white-dominated Parliament, even though the black majority remains excluded. <PERSON> Hendrickse </PERSON> this year also defied President P.W. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> several times by pressing for the abolition of legally-enforced residential segregation. In what one newspaper called `` a humiliating defeat,'' <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday withdrew proposed bills that would have given authorities greater powers to confiscate property and evict and prosecute people living in areas not designated for their race On Aug. 24, a Wimpy hamburger restaurant in <LOCATION> Standerton </LOCATION> also was damaged by a limpet mine blast. Police blamed that attack on the African National Congress. Under apartheid, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s 5 million whites control the economy and maintain separate districts, schools and health services, giving the 26 million blacks no voice in national affairs. State-of-emergency regulations in effect since 1986 restrict reporting about unrest, security force actions, treatment of detainees, some forms of protest, and a broad range of statements the government considers subversive. Enforcement of the regulations has not been comprehensive.

<HEAD>White Anti-Apartheid Leader Visits Mandela in Clinic</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A leading anti-apartheid member of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> brought books, chocolates and fruit on Friday to jailed black leader <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> at the clinic where he is recovering from tuberculosis. The activist lawmaker, <PERSON> Helen </PERSON> <PERSON> Suzman </PERSON>, has met with the <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> leader several times during his 26 years in prison. After the visit, she described <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> as `` very optimistic, very moderate and easy-going.'' `` We did not talk in depth on politics and we did not discuss his possible release,'' she said. She added, however: `` I remain, as over many years, convinced that Mr. <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> is a reasonable man and that he will play a valuable part in any negotiation proceedings.'' <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>, 70, was transferred Wednesday from a state hospital to the <ORGANIZATION> Constantiaberg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Clinic </ORGANIZATION>, a new and relatively luxurious private hospital in a <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION> suburb. <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> was moved Aug. 12 from <LOCATION> Pollsmoor </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Prison </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Tygerberg </LOCATION>, where doctors said he made a good recovery following drainage of fluid from his lungs. <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>, the country's best-known black leader, is serving a life sentence for sabotage and plotting to overthrow the white-led government. Mrs. <PERSON> Suzman </PERSON> met with <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> for about an hour. She took him fruit, chocolates and a book by the late South African writer <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Paton </PERSON>. During the visit she made a quick trip to a shop to buy candied fruit that <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> requested. She said the visit was her first with <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> in more than two years and came about because of persistent requests to Justice Minister <PERSON> Kobie </PERSON> <PERSON> Coetsee </PERSON> following <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>'s hospitalization. <PERSON> Coetsee </PERSON> met with <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> on Thursday and said the prisoner's health had improved considerably A pro-government newspaper, The Citizen, Friday quoted unidentified government sources as saying the move to the clinic was a `` goodwill gesture'' which officials hoped would prompt a conciliatory response from <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> and make his release possible. <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>'s lawyer, <PERSON> Ismail </PERSON> <PERSON> Ayob </PERSON>, has said he does not view the transfer as an indication the government has decided to free <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>. Government officials had suggested previously that <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> would be moved to a clinic, and possibly allowed an increased flow of visitors, before a final decision was made whether to release him outright. Thus far, prison officials have not eased <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>'s visiting priveliges <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>'s full recuperation is likely to take a few months. After that period, the government could choose whether to send him back to prison or grant him freedom. President P.W. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> said two weeks ago he was seriously considering releasing <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> but indicated he wanted <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> to renounce violence. Mrs. <PERSON> Suzman </PERSON>, 71, entered <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> in 1953 and is its longest-serving member. Between 1961 and 1974, she was the only <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> member for the anti-apartheid <ORGANIZATION> Progressive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>.

<TEXT>
 Thousands of people taking shelter from rising floodwaters in <LOCATION> Dhaka </LOCATION>'s streets and parks panicked Friday when monsoon showers hit the city and triggered fears of a deluge. At least 120,000 people have fled homes in the countryside to take shelter in <LOCATION> Dhaka </LOCATION>, a relief official said. `` There was great panic after the rain because for many there was hardly any place to take cover,'' said the official, <PERSON> Abdur </PERSON> <PERSON> Rashid </PERSON>. At least one-third of the country is flooded and newspapers say 758 people have died in house collapses, snake bites and drownings since June, when the annual southwest monsoon hit the subcontinent. The government says only 280 people have died, but its estimates are considered low. More than half of <LOCATION> Dhaka </LOCATION> came under water after the adjacent <LOCATION> Buriganga </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> burst its banks. By Friday evening the river, a tributary of the mighty <LOCATION> Ganges </LOCATION>, was about three inches above flood level, its highest in 34 years. The government has set up 125 relief camps in the city and ordered the closure of all schools and colleges to use the buildings to house displaced people, <PERSON> Rashid </PERSON> said. Floodwaters are 6 feet deep at places, and some residents were reported to be hoarding food. <LOCATION> Dhaka </LOCATION>'s airport remained open for domestic flights, but international airlines were advised to suspend operations for 24 hours. An airport official said up to 2 inches of water covered parts of the complex. The Bengali-language <ORGANIZATION> Sangbad </ORGANIZATION> newspaper said Friday at least 10 more people died in the floods in the northern districts of <LOCATION> Mymnesingh </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Munshiganj </LOCATION>. The Ganges and the <LOCATION> Brahmaputra </LOCATION> rivers and their dozens of tributaries flow from <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> and through <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION> to the Bay of <LOCATION> Bengal </LOCATION>. The rivers flood almost every year after the monsoon showers in <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>. Flooding began in the northern districts about three weeks ago, but areas to the south were affected recently as the waters swirled downstream. International aid for flood victims has arrived in response to an appeal from President <PERSON> Hussain </PERSON> <PERSON> Muhammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Ershad </PERSON>. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has pledged $ 25,000 to help relief efforts and <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> sent four air force helicopters to reach flood-affected areas. <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION> is one of the poorest countries in the world and its 109 million people earn a per capita income of about $ 150 per year. At least 1,500 people died in floods last year. In 1985, more than 10,000 were killed when cyclones and tidal waves hit low-lying islands in the <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bengal </LOCATION>, about 130 miles south of <LOCATION> Dhaka </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Blood Center Chastised Over AIDS Tests</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A blood center has been criticized by federal officials for distributing 22 units of blood before completely ensuring that they were not infected by the virus that causes AIDS, the center's director says. <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> officials inspected the <ORGANIZATION> Belle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bonfils </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Memorial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Blood </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in July and said the center failed to follow standard procedures by releasing blood that initially tested positive for AIDS and hepatitis, said center director Dr. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Chapman </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bonfils </PERSON> supplies blood to regional hospitals. The blood, which went to about 45 people, later tested negative when new chemicals were used in followup tests, said <PERSON> Chapman </PERSON>. Blood center officials also retested all but two of the donors of the blood, and all had negative test results for AIDS and hepatitis, said <PERSON> Chapman </PERSON>. He said transfusion recipients were not contacted, because officials are confident they were not infected. <PERSON> Chapman </PERSON> said the 22 blood units tested positive for the usually fatal AIDS virus and hepatitis during one week in June. `` Ordinarily, we see maybe three to five test positive,'' he said. When any unit of blood tests positive, the center performs two additional tests, said <PERSON> Chapman </PERSON>. If both followup tests are negative, the blood is released. If one is positive, additional tests are done and the blood may be discarded, said <PERSON> Chapman </PERSON>. The 22 units of blood in question did not pass both tests the day after the initial tests read positive for AIDS and hepatitis. But <PERSON> Chapman </PERSON> said laboratory technicians believed the tests were defective and they released the blood. `` This was a really unusual number, and the lab felt something was wrong with the test chemicals,'' the doctor said. `` New chemicals were used the following week, and on retesting all those units were negative'' for the diseases. `` Clearly this shows the tests were faulty,'' said <PERSON> Chapman </PERSON>. `` But ordinarily we would not use a unit when there is any question. ... It's not the safest thing to do.'' The center has instituted a policy requiring supervisors to approve all units of blood that test positive for AIDS, said <PERSON> Chapman </PERSON>. He said lab technicians had made those decisions previously.

 Police fired tear gas into a bank and rushed the building in search of two holdup men who locked four employees in an office as they arrived for work, but the gunmen had apparently fled hours earlier. `` It's ironic the way it worked out,'' said Officer <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>. `` We were here to play it out until the end.

The employees, three women and a man, ran outside about 11 a.m., three hours after the ordeal began. One of the women appeared to be crying.

It was not immediately known if the gunmen stole anything. <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> said he did n't know how the people escaped from the office or whether they realized at that point that the gunmen had apparently gone.

 The <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>'s top army commander chastised Jewish settlers Friday for being too quick to use their weapons after one settler accidentally wounded two soldiers. Palestinians and soldiers fought in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, and hospital officials said 10 Palestinians were injured. Brig. Gen. <PERSON> Amram </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitzna </PERSON> warned the settlers in a 90-minute closed-door meeting to obey army regulations on the firing of weapons, <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION> reported. Settler leaders contended <PERSON> Gedalia </PERSON> <PERSON> Becker </PERSON> was obeying army policy when he opened fire Wednesday after a Palestinian demonstrator threw a firebomb at his car on a <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> road south of <LOCATION> Bethlehem </LOCATION>. Defense Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> recently gave <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers and civilians permission to shoot at firebomb throwers. But <PERSON> Mitzna </PERSON> told the settlers they could open fire only to extricate themselves from immediate danger, the <ORGANIZATION> Itim </ORGANIZATION> news agency said. <PERSON> Becker </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> immigrant, was quoted as saying he acted on instinct honed during service with the American army in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> as a combat helicopter pilot. `` In <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> I walked around with two pistols and a carbine. Whoever thought twice in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> died instantly. Whoever fired survived,'' the Israeli <ORGANIZATION> Davar </ORGANIZATION> daily quoted him as saying. Police released <PERSON> Becker </PERSON> on bail Thursday after he was questioned about the shooting. The gasoline bottle missed <PERSON> Becker </PERSON>'s car and exploded on the road behind it. <PERSON> Becker </PERSON> ran out of the car and opened fire at two figures he spotted nearby, accidentally wounding two soldiers who were chasing the assailant. Since Palestinians began an uprising against <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> rule in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> on Dec. 8, 258 Palestinians have been killed, most by Israeli gunfire. Four Israelis also have died. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> captured the territories in the 1967 <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> war. Palestinians fought soldiers in three towns and refugee camps in the occupied lands. Two Palestinians aged 17 and 18 were wounded by gunfire in a <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> refugee camp after troops opened fire on stone-throwing protesters, said an official at <LOCATION> Shifa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. Five other Palestinians, including two pregnant women and an 18-month-old child, were treated for tear gas inhalation after the clash, said officials in <LOCATION> Ahli </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>. A sixth victim was treated for a two-inch cut in his forehead caused by the impact of a tear gas canister, the official said. The army confirmed one Palestinian was hit by a plastic bullet in the camp after troops fired weapons in response to stonings by protesters. The military had no other reports of injuries. Two other Palestinians were wounded in clashes in and near the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>'s largest city, <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Ghasan </PERSON> <PERSON> Mustafa </PERSON> <PERSON> Ahmad </PERSON> <PERSON> Abed </PERSON>, 16, of <LOCATION> Azzun </LOCATION> village near <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION>, suffered a gunshot wound in the right buttock, said an official at <LOCATION> Al </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ittihad </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Jihad </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamdam </PERSON> <PERSON> Badawi </PERSON> <PERSON> El </PERSON> <PERSON> Zara </PERSON>, 27, was hit by four bullet fragments in the right leg during a separate clash, the official said on condition of anonymity. Also Friday, the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> rejected an appeal by a sentry who was sentenced to 18 months in jail for failing to prevent an attack by a Palestinian guerrilla who rode a hang glider into <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and killed six soldiers in November. The <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> announced that Arabic would be a compulsory subject for all Israeli junior high and high school students this year. The Itim news agency said the requirement would fulfill the army's need for Arabic speakers in the occupied territories. A <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION> district court convicted two Israelis of plotting to murder Arab workers in the nearby suburb of <LOCATION> Or </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Yehuda </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio said. <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON> <PERSON> Saada </PERSON>, 31, and <PERSON> Yaacov </PERSON> <PERSON> Batash </PERSON>, 21, were charged with making firebombs out of beer bottles and planning to throw them at a shack where Arab workers were sleeping on Aug 21. But they panicked and hurled them into an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> backyard instead, the radio said. Earlier in August, three Arabs were killed in an arson attack on a shack where they were sleeping in Or <PERSON> Yehuda </PERSON>. The attack on the Israeli backyard had been blamed on Arabs seeking revenge for the burning deaths. Two other Israelis have been arrested in the Or Yehuda deaths.

 Two brothers in the <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, killed with a third man in a British army ambush, were buried at their home village Friday in a peaceful ceremony watched by 500 riot police. Before dawn, police in <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION> fired plastic bullets to disperse rioters during a third night of violence in Roman Catholic areas. No injuries were reported. The Rev. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Taggart </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> priest who conducted the funeral Mass, spoke of `` disturbing questions'' about British tactics in killing <PERSON> Gerard </PERSON> and <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Harte </PERSON>, aged 29 and 21, and <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Mullin </PERSON>, 26. Police with riot shields and clubs swamped the tiny village 45 miles west of <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION> and flanked the cortege route, making the country lane so narrow some mourners could barely squeeze through. Police said the Hartes and <PERSON> Mullin </PERSON> were well-known <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> men who were armed and dressed for a violent mission when bullets riddled their car Tuesday. Press reports said they were on their way to kill an off-duty soldier. <PERSON> Mullin </PERSON>, who was <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Harte </PERSON>'s brother-in-law, will be buried Saturday in nearby <LOCATION> Dunmoyle </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> supporters say the men could have been given a chance to surrender. The government of the <LOCATION> Irish </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>, although it also has outlawed the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION>, expressed concern and the killings were discussed at a Cabinet meeting Friday. <PERSON> Taggart </PERSON> told the congregation in <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mary </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> the sanctity of human life `` is binding on everyone, not just an ordinary citizen but also on the government and those charged with the administration of the law.'' `` Some disturbing questions have been raised about the circumstances in which these young men died,'' he said. `` It is necessary to point out that the law of the land must obey the moral law.'' Authorities in the Protestant-dominated province appeared determined to prevent the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> from making the funeral a show of anti-British strength. No incidents were reported and no guerrilla paraphernalia was evident, apart from a beret and pair of gloves on each coffin. An <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> statement distributed to news media said it had honored the slain comrades Thursday night by firing a volley in the <LOCATION> Loughmacrory </LOCATION> area. Black flags flew from all the telephone poles in the village and `` IRA the voice of an oppressed people'' was daubed on a wall. A military helicopter hovered low as the coffins, draped in <LOCATION> Irish </LOCATION> flags, reached the graveyard. Its clatter nearly drowned the eulogy delivered by <PERSON> Gerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION>'s legal political wing, <ORGANIZATION> Sinn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fein </ORGANIZATION>. Police say <PERSON> Gerard </PERSON> <PERSON> Harte </PERSON> commanded the mid-Tyrone <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> unit and <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Harte </PERSON> was responsible for choosing targets among police and members of the locally recruited <ORGANIZATION> Ulster </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regiment </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> is fighting to drive the British from <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> and unite it with the <LOCATION> Irish </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>, which is 95 percent <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION>. It acknowledged the three men as members and said they died `` on active service,'' by which it means during an operation, but has given no details of the mission. So far this year, the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> has lost 11 members and has killed 27 British soldiers, including eight with a bomb that blew up their bus Aug. 20 not far from <LOCATION> Loughmacrory </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> responded to the increased attacks by saying new measures would be taken, and the ambush was seen as the beginning of a crackdown. Military officials also have adopted tighter security. Organizers of Sport Aid, a worldwide charity run scheduled for Sept. 11, said the army withdrawn from an event in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Hyde </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>, and the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> explained: `` In the current security climate, regretfully the army can not participate.'' Six British soldiers were killed June 15 by a bomb planted in their van while they participated in a charity run in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>.

 A <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> private and her 9-year-old son are the only Americans identified among the 49 killed when a jet crashed into the crowd at a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> base air show, officials said Friday. More than 600 people attended three private memorial services for the victims, who died after the jet collided with two other fighter jets of the Italian air force precision flying team, crashed and exploded. Two of the 49 killed Sunday at <LOCATION> Ramstein </LOCATION> Air Base remained unidentified, according to police in nearby <LOCATION> Kaiserslautern </LOCATION>. Fourteen children are among the 172 people still hospitalized, officials said. But base spokeswoman Maj. <PERSON> Kathy </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON> said three people remain unidentified. There was no immediate explanation for the discrepancy. She said the identified dead are 39 West Germans, the three Italian pilots, the two Americans and one each from <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION>. `` No more Americans have died that we know of,'' she said. Earlier, officials said they believed six Americans were killed. <LOCATION> Kaiserslautern </LOCATION> police said 40 West Germans were among the dead. One of the dead was a pregnant woman, said a police official who spoke on condition of anonymity. <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> officials identified the two Americans as <PERSON> Joshua </PERSON> <PERSON> Frymyer </PERSON> and his mother, 36-year-old <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pfc </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Genevieve </PERSON> <PERSON> Riggs </PERSON>, who was stationed in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. Mrs. <PERSON> Riggs </PERSON>' husband, <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> Sgt. <PERSON> Myron </PERSON> <PERSON> Riggs </PERSON>, was among seven people evacuated to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> this week for treatment of burn injuries. Ms. <PERSON> White </PERSON> said the bodies of the mother and son were flown back to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, but she did not know where they were being taken. <PERSON> Juergen </PERSON> <PERSON> Dietzen </PERSON>, spokesman for <LOCATION> Rhineland-Palatinate </LOCATION> state where <LOCATION> Ramstein </LOCATION> is located, said 14 children under age 14 are among the 172 people still hospitalized. He also said that 10 to 12 of the hospitalized victims were in `` life-threatening condition,'' but did not say if children were among them. The unofficial <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Armed Forces newspaper Stars and Stripes told of anguish and grieving as more than 600 people attended three private memorial services Thursday night at <LOCATION> Ramstein </LOCATION> and in <LOCATION> Kaiserslautern </LOCATION>. `` As a call went out for a moment of silent prayer heads bowed, some shook as if in disbelief, some quivered from crying,'' the newspaper said of one of the services. West Germans and Americans, including <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> Europe Commander Gen. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON>, attended the services, the paper said. It quoted Chaplain Col. <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> as saying at one service: `` We must rid ourselves of feeling guilty that we live while they died. To survive such ... spiritual pain, we must cry, whether privately or publicly, and vent our anger that our loved ones have been taken from ourselves forever.'' A public memorial service is set for Saturday at a church in <LOCATION> Ramstein </LOCATION>. Top West German leaders and <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Burt </PERSON> are scheduled to attend. In other developments: _ The <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION> said that on the same day as Sunday's tragedy, West German air force officers went ahead with a party after an air exhibition at another site in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> even though they had been informed of what happened at <LOCATION> Ramstein </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Winfried </PERSON> <PERSON> Dunkel </PERSON> said the officers could face disciplinary action. _ <PERSON> Werver </PERSON> <PERSON> Overbeck </PERSON>, chief surgeon at <LOCATION> Kaiserslautern </LOCATION> hospital, angrily rejected allegations that victims with serious burns were not taken to special treatment centers. `` Injured patients that were n't treated in special burn centers had other kinds of injuries such as broken bones, or they had burns that did not need to be treated in special clinics,'' <PERSON> Overbeck </PERSON> said.

Assistant Attorney General <PERSON> Creighton </PERSON> <PERSON> Horton </PERSON> said murder charges in <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>'s death probably will be filed Tuesday. <PERSON> Swapp </PERSON> admitted at trial that he bombed the <ORGANIZATION> Kamas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stake </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, saying it was ordered by <PERSON> God </PERSON> as a sign of the impending collapse of church, state and nation. He said the bombing also was intended to draw attention to the 1979 slaying of polygamist <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Singer </PERSON>, Mrs. Singer's husband and father of <PERSON> Swapp </PERSON>'s wives. The family contends Singer was murdered in a `` church-state conspiracy'' that began with his refusal to send his children to public schools. <PERSON> Jenkins </PERSON> today told <PERSON> Swapp </PERSON> he was being sent to prison `` not for what you say, not for what you believe _ for what you did.'' `` There's no case I know of that more clearly shows the wisdom of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in imposing minimum sentences than this one,'' said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Brent </PERSON> <PERSON> Ward </PERSON>, who said the government may file an appeal for harsher penalties. The Swapp brothers and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Singer </PERSON> were found guilty of attempted murder of <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents, resisting and assaulting agents and firearms counts. <PERSON> Addam </PERSON> <PERSON> Swapp </PERSON> also was found guilty of explosives offenses and damaging the church. Mrs. Singer was convicted of weapons and explosives charges and assaulting and resisting agents.

 A West German freighter carrying 2,100 tons of toxic wastes will unload its cargo in <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, government officials said Friday. The ship, the <PERSON> Karin </PERSON> <PERSON> B </PERSON>, was denied permission to dock in <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>. The wastes originally were shipped from <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> and dumped illegally in <LOCATION> Nigeria </LOCATION>. Environment Minister <PERSON> Giorgio </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruffolo </PERSON> and Civil Defense Minister <PERSON> Vito </PERSON> <PERSON> Lattanzio </PERSON> said after a Cabinet meeting that the wastes probably will be unloaded at an unspecified Italian military port. The ship is anchored in international waters off the coast of <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>. The wastes may have come from as many as 10 European countries, but they were shipped from <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Nigeria </LOCATION>'s military government seized an Italian ship, the Piave, last July to bolster its demand that <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> remove the wastes. The <PERSON> Karin </PERSON> <PERSON> B </PERSON> was the first of two ships sent to pick up the wastes. It sailed from <LOCATION> Nigeria </LOCATION> on July 30. The second ship, The Deep Sea Carrier, sailed from <LOCATION> Nigeria </LOCATION> on Aug. 15 and reportedly is steaming off the coast of <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION>. The Cabinet announcement did not mention the second ship. Officials have said they do n't know the precise chemical content of the cargo. But on Wednesday, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Smeraldi </PERSON>, a spokesman for the environmental group Friends of the <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>, said its lab technicians in <LOCATION> Nigeria </LOCATION> found the drums contained PCBs and were highly flammable. PCBs, or polycholorinated biphenyls, can cause cancer and burns on contact. The plight of the <PERSON> Karin </PERSON> <PERSON> B </PERSON> is similar to that of the <LOCATION> Zanoobia </LOCATION>, the Syrian freighter that was <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>'s first so-called ship of poison. It wandered the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> for four months with a cargo that had once been dumped illegally in <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>.

 The first big radio telescope array in the <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hemisphere </LOCATION> began operating Friday, opening a new window on the little-explored southern sky. `` We'll be looking at the center of our galaxy because it passes right above our head in the <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hemisphere </ORGANIZATION>,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Ekers </PERSON>, the director of the instrument named the <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> Telescope. `` Much of the galaxy and the nearest neighboring galaxy, the <ORGANIZATION> Magellanic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cloud </ORGANIZATION> is not visible to observatories in the Northern Hemisphere.'' Ekers, who for seven years was director of the 27-dish, Very Large Array radio telescope in western <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, said the telescope will study black holes and pulsars. The new $ 40 million instrument located on the windswept plains of western <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Wales </LOCATION>, consists of five new 72.6-foot dishes mounted on 1.86 miles of railroad track. An identical dish on a track 1.86 miles away will make the array equivalent to one dish with a diameter 3.72 miles. When linked to the exisiting 211-foot-dish at Parkes 241 miles to the south and others spread across the continent, the <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Telescope </LOCATION> can be extended like a zoom lens on a camera, to the equivalent of a dish 2,400 miles in diameter. The Commonwealth Scientific and <ORGANIZATION> Industrial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, the government - funded research institution that designed the telescope, said the compact array of seven telescopes had an equivalent resolution to being able to read a telephone directory at a distance of 660 feet When linked to telescopes in space, it would be 10,000 times greater. `` The <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Telescope </LOCATION> is the state of the art in astronomical technology, it is one of the best telescopes in the world,'' Prime Minister <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Hawke </PERSON> told an audience of astronomers and scientists at the inaugural ceremony. <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> der </PERSON> <PERSON> Laan </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Observatory </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION>, said: `` If <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> had n't built it, the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Observatory </ORGANIZATION> would have had to do it in <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION>.'' `` We have the biggest optical telescopes in the <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hemisphere </ORGANIZATION> at <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Silla </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION>, but we had no major radio telescope array.

<HEAD>Jobless Rate Increases to 5.6 Percent</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MATT YANCEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Labor Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Unemployment climbed to 5.6 percent in August as the number of jobless Americans grew by 226,000 and a four-month hiring boom in the nation's factories ended abruptly, the government said Friday. Stock and bond prices soared on the news, and analysts said the softening job market was just the `` cold shower'' than an overheating economy needed. They predicted it will keep a lid on inflation and interest rates through the November elections. The 0.2 percentage point rise from July's unemployment rate of 5.4 percent was characterized by 5,000 layoffs in a manufacturing sector that had put 130,000 more workers on their assembly lines in the previous three months in response to surging foreign demand for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> exports. Last month, when factories reported adding 70,000 workers in July despite a slight increase in joblessness from a 14-year-low 5.3 percent in June, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> applied the brakes to the economy, raising interest rates one-half percentage point. `` This is a case where bad news is good news for an economy that was running hell-bent toward overheating and creating a very worrisome inflationary environment,'' <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> <PERSON> Sinai </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> economic consulting firm, said of the August jobs report. `` A little cold shower here was exactly what was needed.'' <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Rahn </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION>'s chief economist and a frequent critic of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION>'s monetary policies, said the unemployment figures show that the board `` has achieved its goal of slowing the economy.'' `` They now should reduce interest rates to avoid killing the expansion,'' he said. Most other analysts said they doubt that will happen, but they agreed there is now little likelihood that interest rates will be raised again before the election. A separate survey of business payrolls showed employers adding 219,000 new jobs in August, compared with average monthly gains of more than 325,000 the previous three months. <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Chimerine </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> WEFA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, a <PERSON> Bala </PERSON> <PERSON> Cynwyd </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, economic consulting firm, said the smaller payroll growth is consistent with an economy that is still expanding, but at a slower pace. `` Clearly this will delay further tightening by the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>,'' he said. `` They wo n't reverse what they did last month but they can now afford to take a wait-and-see attitude. Clearly there is no evidence of a wage-price spiral. The inflation we are getting is limited primarily to commodity prices, imports and food, and at this point does not threat to become much more widespread.'' `` This is another stroke of -LRB- President -RRB- <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s luck, a one-month cooling down when inflation pressures were building rapidly in a too steamy economy,'' <PERSON> Sinai </PERSON> said. `` There are two more unemployment reports between now and the election, but if the rate stays between 5.4 percent and 5.8 percent, it can only be described as a major accomplishment.'' Despite the increase in the unemployment rate, the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said a record 62.3 percent of the working-age population 16 and over held jobs in August. Campaigning in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, Republican presidential nominee <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> called the rise in the jobless rate `` statistically almost irrelevant. The total work force has been expanding ... it's very encouraging,'' he said <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Estrich </PERSON>, campaign manager for Democratic nominee <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, called the loss of 5,000 manufacturing jobs and the failure of wages to rise above their $ 9.31 hourly average in July `` blows to hopes for prosperity in the nation's heartland -LRB- and -RRB- easing the squeeze on working Americans.'' Wages have risen an average of only 3.1 percent over the past 12 months, decreasing the buying power of workers by one-half percent after taking inflation into account. The <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said most of the 226,000 increase in joblessness to 6,851,000 people in August occurred among adult men, whose unemployment rate rose 0.4 percentage points to 4.9 percent. The unemployment rate also rose among teen-agers, from 15.2 percent to 15.8 percent, but fell from 5.1 percent to 4.8 percent for women and from 11.4 percent to 11.3 percent among blacks. Small employment gains in printing and publishing and export-related industries such as machinery and electrical equipment were more than offset by 9,000 job losses in textile and apparel plants and smaller declines in several other manufacturing industries. On the services side of the economy, large monthly increases in retail trade hiring _ 80,000 in July alone _ slowed to just 23,000 new jobs last month, virtually all of them in grocery stores. Other recent high-growth job areas also slackened. Business services such as temporary help firms added just 16,000 new workers, compared with average monthly increases of 30,000 in June and July. New employment in health services, which the government predicts will be the largest area of job growth in the 1990s as the Baby Boom population ages, slowed to 22,000 in August from its 30,000-a-month average in the past year. <PERSON> Janet </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Norwood </PERSON>, commissioner of labor statistics, said one encouraging sign was that the number of people working part-time because they could not find full-time jobs `` returned to the bottom of the 5.2 million-to-5 .6 million range within which it has been fluctuating for more than a year. Other data in the report, however, suggested the economy might be slowing. The average work week declined by 20 minutes to 34.6 hours and manufacturing overtime fell by 0.1 hours to 3.8 hours a week on average. A separate calculation that includes the 1.7 million active-duty military personnel stationed in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> showed a jobless rate of 5.5 percent last month, up from 5.4 percent in July.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> welcomed former top aide <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sasso </PERSON> back to his presidential campaign Friday, nearly a year after <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> declared that <PERSON> Sasso </PERSON> `` will not be back'' because of his role in torpedoing Sen. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Biden </PERSON>'s bid for the Democratic nomination. The return of <PERSON> Sasso </PERSON> as campaign vice chairman, announced jointly by <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and his senior advisers in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, was widely seen as another signal that the Democratic nominee has decided to mount a more aggressive campaign at a time when Republican <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has pulled even in most polls. `` Almost a year ago, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sasso </PERSON> made a very serious mistake,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> reporters. `` He's paid the price.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said he was rehiring his longtime political alter-ego because he wanted to assemble `` the strongest team I possibly can'' for the final two months of the campaign. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said <PERSON> Sasso </PERSON>'s return had nothing to do with his recent decline in the polls. `` It's simply the fact we're looking at a little more than two months of what is going to be a very tough, very competitive campaign,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. `` It's going to be a battle royal for the presidency of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> chief of staff <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> Fuller </PERSON> said the rehiring of <PERSON> Sasso </PERSON> `` speaks for itself.'' <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> vice presidential nominee <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, campaigning in <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>, said it was `` another sign that the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign is in serious trouble.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said <PERSON> Sasso </PERSON>'s involvement in the <PERSON> Biden </PERSON> incident `` should not obscure a long and well-deserved reputation for character and for integrity.'' In <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Sasso </PERSON> received a thunderous ovation from <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign and state government loyalists when he walked into a news conference with campaign chairman <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Brountas </PERSON> and <PERSON> Sasso </PERSON>'s replacement as campaign manager, <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Estrich </PERSON> <PERSON> Sasso </PERSON> directed <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' gubernatorial comeback in 1982, served as statehouse chief of staff and was architect of the nominee's presidential campaign He resigned in September 1987 admitting that he circulated a videotape showing <PERSON> Biden </PERSON> using a British politician's rhetoric without attribution. News accounts about that incident and charges of plagiarism forced <PERSON> Biden </PERSON> to withdraw from the Democratic presidential contest. At first, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> denied that his campaign staff was responsible for the videotapes, but he later acknowledged that <PERSON> Sasso </PERSON> was behind them. <PERSON> Sasso </PERSON> and political director <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Tully </PERSON>, who helped <PERSON> Sasso </PERSON> prepare the tapes, then resigned. `` What I did back on September was an error in judgment and I am sorry that it hurt Sen. <PERSON> Biden </PERSON> and his family,'' <PERSON> Sasso </PERSON> said Friday. <PERSON> Sasso </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> both spoke to <PERSON> Biden </PERSON> earlier Friday before his return to the campaign was announced, aides said. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said <PERSON> Biden </PERSON> `` could not have been more gracious.'' <PERSON> Sasso </PERSON> dismissed suggestions that his return would give the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign an excuse to accuse <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> of planning a `` sleaze'' campaign. That would be `` outrageous'' of the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> people, he said. `` They certainly have a problem along those lines.'' Although he apologized to <PERSON> Biden </PERSON>, <PERSON> Sasso </PERSON> said there was nothing `` unethical or illegal'' about distributing accurate videotapes showing the similarity of speeches by <PERSON> Biden </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> Kinnock </PERSON>. <PERSON> Biden </PERSON> issued a statement saying he was glad <PERSON> Sasso </PERSON> had agreed that the <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> senator `` never meant to mislead anyone.'' <PERSON> Biden </PERSON> said he still supports <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> for president. `` There are contrasts and weaknesses that are issues in this campaign,'' said <PERSON> Sasso </PERSON>, who will take a leave of absence from his job with an advertising firm. `` I will not shy away from pointing those contrasts out.'' That promise drew applause from campaign workers who have complained that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and his top aides had not counter-attacked vigorously enough when <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> misprepresented <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' record. If nothing else, <PERSON> Sasso </PERSON>'s return energized a campaign staff that has been sobered in recent weeks by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s surge in the polls. Many believe that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' failure to respond to the Republican nominee's salvos has cost the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor the momentum _ and the lead in the polls _ that he took from the Democratic National Convention. <PERSON> Sasso </PERSON> said spoke to <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> on Tuesday and was asked if he would return. `` I said if he thought I could help, of course I'd do it,'' <PERSON> Sasso </PERSON> said. `` Now we've got all of our best players on the field,'' said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> issues adviser <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Herman </PERSON>. <PERSON> Brountas </PERSON> said he, <PERSON> Estrich </PERSON> and <PERSON> Sasso </PERSON> would report directly to <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and that other campaign staff would continue to report to <PERSON> Estrich </PERSON>. Campaign aides insisted that the decision to rehire <PERSON> Sasso </PERSON> was not a sign of dissatisfaction with <PERSON> Estrich </PERSON>'s performance, although several said her role in campaign strategy likely would be reduced somewhat. She put the best light on the announcement. `` Today, a family is reunited,'' she said, introducing <PERSON> Sasso </PERSON> to reporters. `` There's nothing more special, nothing more satisfying, than reaching out to family. And to me, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sasso </PERSON> is family.'' <PERSON> Brountas </PERSON> said <PERSON> Sasso </PERSON> would bring `` additional strength, important political insight and wisdom to a very strong campaign team.''

 Two tremors were recorded Friday at a seismic station here, aftershocks from a deadly earthquake last month which killed more than 1,000 people in <LOCATION> Nepal </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, seismologists said. No damage or injuries were reported in the latest temblors. Seismologists said a tremor registering 4.8 on the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale occured at 3:45 a.m. and another, registering 5 on the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale, took place at 12:20 p.m. The epicentre of the tremors was in <LOCATION> Udayapur </LOCATION>, 35 miles north of the India-Nepal border, the seismologists said. The Richter scale measures the engery released by an earthquake according to the ground motion as recorded by seismographs. A reading of 6 means the earthquake can cause severe damage and a reading of 7 indicates a major earthquake. The earthquake Aug. 21 registered 6.5 on the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale.

<TEXT>
 School officials in a small southwestern <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> town need more guidance before they can respond to a federal order striking down their ban on school-sponsored dancing, according to their attorney. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> ruled last month that the ban on dancing at <ORGANIZATION> Purdy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> was unconstitutional because it promoted the values of those who oppose dancing for religious reasons. The judge said it was not his role to order the district to hold dances, but he said the district could not enforce a no-dance rule that some believe to be a century old. `` Defendants respectfully submit that they do not understand what the court is ordering them to do or refrain from doing,'' wrote school district attorney <PERSON> Ransom </PERSON> <PERSON> Ellis </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> in a brief filed Thursday. But lawyer <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Fleischaker </PERSON>, representing the 21 young people and parents who challenged the ban, said `` there's no question in my mind'' about the order. `` Any efforts by the school district to unreasonably prevent the students from having a dance would be in contempt of that order,'' <PERSON> Fleischaker </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Fleischaker </PERSON> said <PERSON> Ellis </PERSON>' request for a clarification was `` typical of what's gone on all along here _ the school district has abandoned responsibility. They said, ` We ca n't allow dancing because of the rule.' Now they're saying, ` We do n't know what we have to do. Judge, you tell us what we have to do.' They've run for school board, let them use some responsibility.'' The <PERSON> Purdy </PERSON> school system, centered in a town of about 900 people 50 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Springfield </LOCATION>, has about 520 pupils. <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> did not address <PERSON> Ellis </PERSON>' arguments at a hearing Friday, during which the judge considered the amount of attorney fees to be awarded the pro-dance lawyers. The judge said he would make his final ruling in the case by the end of next week.

<TEXT>
 A former engineer's $ 3 billion lawsuits against rocket-maker <PERSON> Morton </PERSON> <PERSON> Thiokol </PERSON>, stemming from his warnings against launching the ill-fated Challenger space shuttle mission, were dismissed Friday by a judge. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Winder </PERSON>'s decision came after more than six months of deliberations on <ORGANIZATION> Morton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Thiokol </ORGANIZATION>'s motions to dismiss the suits filed by <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Boisjoly </PERSON>. Telephone calls to <PERSON> Boisjoly </PERSON>'s <PERSON> Willard </PERSON> residence were answered by a recording. He did not return messages. His attorney, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Levin </PERSON>, said from his office in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, that a decision had not been made on whether to appeal <PERSON> Winder </PERSON>'s ruling to the 10th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>. `` I obviously wish it was better news than we got,'' <PERSON> Levin </PERSON> said. `` -LRB- But -RRB- I have n't seen it yet, and I obviously ca n't comment on a ruling I have n't seen.'' <ORGANIZATION> Morton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Thiokol </ORGANIZATION> officials were elated, said company spokesman <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Snow </PERSON>. `` The dismissal of these two suits completely vindicates <PERSON> Morton </PERSON> <PERSON> Thiokol </PERSON>. We are very happy to have this situation behind us,'' he said. In one of his suits, <PERSON> Boisjoly </PERSON> sought $ 1 billion for the deaths of the seven astronauts killed when Challenger exploded on Jan. 28, 1986, and $ 1 million in compensatory damages for <PERSON> Boisjoly </PERSON>'s own health and career. <PERSON> Boisjoly </PERSON> _ who left <ORGANIZATION> Morton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Thiokol </ORGANIZATION> in July 1986 citing physical ailments and alleged mental torment _ claimed the aerospace company impugned his professional reputation after he and other engineers told a presidential commission investigating the disaster that they had warned against the launch. The <ORGANIZATION> Rogers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> found that a faulty seal in a joint in a solid fuel booster rocket made by <PERSON> Morton </PERSON> <PERSON> Thiokol </PERSON> was to blame for the explosion. <PERSON> Boisjoly </PERSON> and several other <ORGANIZATION> Morton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Thiokol </ORGANIZATION> engineers had argued the night before the launch that temperatures of 53 degrees below Fahrenheit or less could result in failure of the seal. His other lawsuit, filed under the False Claims Act on behalf of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> taxpayers, sought $ 2.075 billion and alleged that <PERSON> Morton </PERSON> <PERSON> Thiokol </PERSON> knowingly provided <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> with defective rocket motors. But <PERSON> Winder </PERSON> ruled that `` the ` conspiracy' alleged in the complaint is not of a nature to support an action for damages on the part of <PERSON> Boisjoly </PERSON> ... neither the conspiracy itself nor the overt acts allegedly done in furtherance of it were directed toward <PERSON> Boisjoly </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Boisjoly </PERSON> also alleged that <PERSON> Morton </PERSON> <PERSON> Thiokol </PERSON>'s setting aside of his recommendation against launching Challenger _ and, after the accident, alleged attempts by the company to discredit him, threaten his employment and its action removing him from the disaster investigation _ left him `` severely injured in his emotional and mental health.'' Company lawyers argued that <PERSON> Boisjoly </PERSON>, who this year won the Scientific Freedom and Responsibility Award from the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advancement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION>, had based his contention that he was defamed on office chatter. But <PERSON> Levin </PERSON> accused company officials of launching a deliberate campaign to defame <PERSON> Boisjoly </PERSON> through pamphlets and interviews, `` not coffee-shop stuff.'' <PERSON> Winder </PERSON> dismissed most counts in <PERSON> Boisjoly </PERSON>'s suits with prejudice, meaning they can not be refiled. However, he said he dismissed two counts of <PERSON> Boisjoly </PERSON>'s first civil suit, which deal with allegations of defamation and conspiracy, without prejudice `` by agreement of the parties.''

<HEAD>Feuding Black Groups Sign Accord</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Rival black political groups signed an accord Friday to end what has been called the country's worst factional fighting this century in which more than 600 people have been killed in 20 months An explosion rocked downtown <LOCATION> Durban </LOCATION> just after the evening rush hour, causing extensive damage to a clothing store and slightly injuring a black woman, police said. In other cities, a hand grenade was tossed at the home of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s leading mixed-race politician, and a bomb exploded in a post office. No injuries were reported in either attack. The agreement signed Friday sought to halt savage fighting in the <LOCATION> Natal </LOCATION> province between supporters of militant anti-apartheid organizations and members of <ORGANIZATION> Inkatha </ORGANIZATION>, a more conservative group headed by <PERSON> Zulu </PERSON> leader <PERSON> Mangosuthu </PERSON> <PERSON> Buthelezi </PERSON>. It was signed at a courthouse in the provincial capital, <LOCATION> Pietermaritzburg </LOCATION>, by <PERSON> Inkatha </PERSON>'s secretary-general <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> <PERSON> Dhlomo </PERSON> and by <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Naidoo </PERSON>, secretary - general of the militant <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> African Trade Unions The labor federation has been allied with the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, a now-banned anti-apartheid coalition, in the feud against <ORGANIZATION> Inkatha </ORGANIZATION>. The agreement condemns violence and establishes an adjudication board to review complaints of harassment or attacks. The board's members would be selected jointly by the two sides and would have disciplinary powers `` Each party recognizes the immediate necessity to make it abundantly clear to its members that <ORGANIZATION> COSATU </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Inkatha </ORGANIZATION> categorically condemn acts of intimidation, forced recruitment and violence,'' the agreement says. `` All political organizations have the right to exist and the <ORGANIZATION> democratic </ORGANIZATION> right to espouse their own particular viewpoint.'' <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Haysom </PERSON>, a lawyer for the labor federation who helped draft the accord, said both sides were cautious about their ability to convince rank-and-file supporters to honor the pact. `` The level of retribution and atrocious violence has made conditions almost impossible to exercise freedom of association,'' he said. <PERSON> Haysom </PERSON> said the adjudication board will be able to judge cases far more quickly than the courts can and will seek to gain the confidence of witnesses who have been fearful of making statements to police. Supreme Court Justice N.S. Page, who had asked the two sides to pursue an accord, said the courts were not abdicating their responsibilities but viewed the new board as a valuable additional tool to help stop the bloodshed. Most of the fighting has been in black townships around <LOCATION> Pietermaritzburg </LOCATION>, although it has spread in recent months to townships near the larger port city of <LOCATION> Durban </LOCATION>. Many of the killings have been to avenge earlier killings. Both Inkatha, which claims 1.5 million members, and the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> Front-labor federation alliance oppose the apartheid policies which enable 5 million whites to dominate 26 million blacks. But their strategies differ markedly. The <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, a predominantly black coalition of some 600 groups, advocates economic sanctions, strikes, and other confrontational measures to bring about sweeping political and economic change. Inkatha opposes sanctions, avoids militant protest and advocates capitalism. Many militants view <PERSON> Buthelezi </PERSON> as a government collaborator because he is chief minister of the <ORGANIZATION> KwaZulu </ORGANIZATION> homeland. However, <PERSON> Buthelezi </PERSON> has rejected invitations by the government to join in negotiating reforms that would expand blacks' political role while leaving whites in ultimate control. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Kerschoff </PERSON>, a social worker in <LOCATION> Pietermaritzburg </LOCATION> who has been involved in past reconciliation efforts, said the agreement was not the final step toward peace. Because of government bans and restrictions, he said in a telephone interview, `` it is extremely difficult for <ORGANIZATION> COSATU </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> UDF </ORGANIZATION> to communicate with grassroots people. This will have to be addressed.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Natal </ORGANIZATION> violence has distressed anti-apartheid campaigners elsewhere in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and sparked debate over whether black political groups could unite effectively to oppose the white-led government. Some commentators viewed the conflict as a harbinger of widespread infighting that might develop as black groups with different ideologies struggled for supremacy.

<HEAD>Iran, Iraq Accuse Each Other of 74 Cease-fire Violations</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> accused each other Friday of violating a two-week cease-fire more than 70 times, and a new <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> mediator sought ways to break a deadlock in talks aimed at ending their eight-year war. The foreign ministers of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> met separately Friday with Swedish diplomat <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Eliasson </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Therese </PERSON> <PERSON> Gastaut </PERSON> said the talks were `` intensive'' but declined to provide further details. <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Secretary-General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> appointed <PERSON> Eliasson </PERSON> mediator on Thursday. The foreign ministers, <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Akbar </PERSON> <PERSON> Velayati </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Tariq </PERSON> <PERSON> Aziz </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, have not met since Aug. 26, the second day of the talks. Since then, the talks have continued at a lower, technical level. They are to continue on Saturday. The talks have bogged down over follow-up procedures to the cease-fire, which took effect Aug. 20. The problems involve the withdrawal of troops and freedom of navigation in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>. After meeting with <PERSON> Eliasson </PERSON>, <PERSON> Velayati </PERSON> told reporters that `` after the establishment of the cease-fire, <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> has had more than 60 kinds of violations of the terms of the cease-fire.'' The Iranian diplomatic mission later released a list of what it said were 74 violations of the cease-fire by <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> as of Aug. 31, which it said were reported to the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> secretary general. The list included alleged violations on every day of the cease-fire except Aug. 28 and Aug. 31. It said there were nine violations on the first day. The last entry said that on Aug. 30, Iraqi forces fired an artillery shell in the <LOCATION> Mehran </LOCATION> area, about 100 miles east of <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION>, in the central front, killing four people. The official <ORGANIZATION> Iraqi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> also said it counted 74 reports of cease-fire violations by <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> since the cease-fire. It said the Iranians aimed, `` through these violations, to reorganize some of their military units, establishing observation posts, firing flares and moving personnel-laden vehicles.'' It repeated previous claims that Iranian gunfire was aimed at <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> positions and that an Iraqi soldier was killed. In addition, Iranian forces `` attempted to approach the border in various sectors, and reinforced their units in forward positions, and redeployed in new areas,'' the agency said. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s commander and chief and <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> speaker, <PERSON> Hashemi </PERSON> <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON>, said <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> is trying to `` rekindle the flames of war'' by claiming sovereignty over the disputed Shatt-al-Arab waterway, a major sticking point in the negotiations. A 1975 treaty split the waterway down the middle, but <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> claims the pact is void and has made ownership of the entire waterway along the southern border a key issue at the peace talks. <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> radio and the official <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, monitored in <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> spoke at a prayer sermon at <ORGANIZATION> Tehran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. `` We call on the armed forces to observe the cease-fire fully, but if the enemy commits an offense, then it is only just that we should answer him,'' he said. `` We should preserve our full preparedness at the fronts until we arrive at a lasting peace.''

Arresting officers found two AK-47 assault rifles and three .38 caliber pistols in the Irishmen's car, <PERSON> Prechtel </PERSON> said.

 A Gulf weather system exploded Friday into Hurricane Debby, the first hurricane of the season, and was bearing down on the east coast of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, National Hurricane Center forecasters said. The Mexican government posted hurricane warnings from <LOCATION> Punta </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jerez </LOCATION> to <PERSON> Vera </PERSON> <PERSON> Cruz </PERSON> for <PERSON> Debby </PERSON>, which had winds of 75 mph, making it a minimal hurricane, said forecaster <PERSON> Hal </PERSON> <PERSON> Gerrish </PERSON>. `` All precautions should be rushed to completion in what little time remains before the center crosses the coast near <LOCATION> Tuxpan </LOCATION> in the next several hours,'' <PERSON> Gerrish </PERSON> warned Friday afternoon. Heavy rains accumulating up to 10 inches can be expected over parts of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, and flash floods and mud slides may occur in the area of the warning and inland Friday and Friday night, he said. <PERSON> Debby </PERSON> surprised forecasters, rapidly developing into a tropical storm early Fridday and then into a hurricane by the afternoon, <PERSON> Gerrish </PERSON> said. On Friday morning, forecasters had expected the storm to fizzle out when it hit <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s coast. But an <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> reconnaissance plane found that <PERSON> Debby </PERSON> was gaining strength as it approached the coast. `` This is a small system and sometimes small systems can strengthen rapidly in this area without much warning,'' <PERSON> Gerrish </PERSON> explained.

<TEXT>
 A court acquitted a 66-year-old man Friday who had walked through the streets of <LOCATION> Graz </LOCATION> cursing Jews and raising his arm in the Nazi salute. Witnesses said <PERSON> Rudolf </PERSON> <PERSON> Hofer </PERSON> had shouted anti-Semitic remarks, the <ORGANIZATION> Austria </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> reported. It said the incident occurred this summer but did not give a date. <PERSON> Hofer </PERSON> also said, `` I am going to finish off all Jews with my 10-man unit and two hand grenades,'' witnesses testified, and was challenged by two passersby who called a policeman. According to the news agency report, the judge said a law against anti-Semitic incitement did not apply because few people were present at the time. The prosecutor appealed.

<TEXT>
 More than 60 Iowans returned home Friday after 10 days in <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> harvesting surplus hay to replace forage the drought has cost them, and they were greeted by friends, relatives and Gov. <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Branstad </PERSON>. `` I just want you to know the people of <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> appreciate what you've done,'' <PERSON> Branstad </PERSON> told the workers. `` As you know, 1988 has been a rough year, and we are proud of the way our farmers have handled it. Sometimes the worst of times bring out the best in people.'' Residents brought out coffee and donuts to greet the 64 workers when the buses rolled in at 7:20 a.m. The workers, all volunteers and including both farmers and non-farmers, said they were tired but enjoyed the experience. `` There were long days and a lot of hard work but a lot of fun to go with it,'' said <PERSON> Lane </PERSON> <PERSON> Schuldt </PERSON>, a livestock farmer from near <LOCATION> Van </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Wert </LOCATION>. The buses also made other stops Friday morning in <LOCATION> Bevington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Osceola </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Chariton </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Albia </LOCATION>. The Iowans boarded buses in those communities Aug. 21 and joined volunteers from other <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> states in harvesting more than 10,000 bales of hay. The hay came from set-aside land that was opened for emergency harvesting by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> in response to the drought that stunted grass in <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> fields. The hay will be distributed first to farmers who made the trip or sent workers on the trip, said <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Belden </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Farm </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> regional manager in <LOCATION> Monroe </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, noting that some farmers could not leave but instead hired workers to go to <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>. Others high on the list for the hay are needy farmers who could not make the trip because of age or health. `` Many <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> livestock producers were faced with potential liquidation of their herds. This hay will maybe held tide them over,'' <PERSON> Branstad </PERSON> said. `` I need some hay,'' said <PERSON> Schuldt </PERSON>, who is n't sure how much he will receive. Some of the workers are not farmers but took the trip anyway. `` I just wanted to help out,'' said <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Pomeroy </PERSON>, who lives in <LOCATION> Pomeroy </LOCATION> and holds a non-farm job in <LOCATION> Webster </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. `` It's been a lot of fun,'' he said. `` It was very nice. I'd never been out there. The project was coordinated by <ORGANIZATION> Farm </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> officials in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>. They arranged free transportation by Greyhound buses and free rail shipment of the hay by <ORGANIZATION> Burlington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Northern </ORGANIZATION>. Food, lodging and haying equipment in <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> were donated by local businesses and farmers. `` It's beautiful country out there, and I could n't believe the way the people treated us,'' said <PERSON> Schuldt </PERSON>. `` They were excellent people,'' <PERSON> Pomeroy </PERSON> said. `` We ate well all the way.'' The hay is not due to arrive for several days, so arrangements must still be made to unload it from the train and haul it to farms, and <PERSON> Belden </PERSON> said more volunteers are being sought for that job. The governor said he called <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Cecil </PERSON> <PERSON> Andrus </PERSON> on Thursday to express his thanks. `` Maybe the time will come when they'll need our help, and we can reciprocate,'' he said.

 Call them the mountain bike cops.

The department began considering the idea after an officer suggested a bicycle would be easier than a car to maneuver on downtown streets and sidewalks. The chosen two will wear helmets and padded bicycle shorts as long as the warm weather lasts. They will carry a gun and radio. With winter approaching, this is not the ideal season to experiment with bicycles, <PERSON> Poole </PERSON> said. `` But if it works in the winter, it will work anytime,'' he said.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Solzhenitsyn </PERSON>, expelled in 1974 for writing about the horrors of <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>'s rule, was invited to join an official committee building a monument to the dictator's victims, an organizer said Friday The move does not necessarily mean an easing in official attitudes toward the dissident writer, but it is due to the number of Soviet citizens who think <PERSON> Solzhenitsyn </PERSON> is one of the best qualified people to serve on the committee, said organizer <PERSON> Yuri </PERSON> <PERSON> Samadunov </PERSON>. The 1970 Nobel laureate's masterwork, `` The Gulag Archipelago,'' traces the history of political repression in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and dwells at length on the purges and widespread repression that marred the 29-year reign of <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>. <PERSON> Solzhenitsyn </PERSON>, who spent eight years in labor camps under <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>, was expelled from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> after the publication of the `` Gulag'' trilogy in the West. He now lives in <LOCATION> Cavendish </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Vt </LOCATION>. Under Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> and his legacy have come in for increasingly severe criticism. In July, the ruling <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Politburo </ORGANIZATION> approved the building of a monument in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> to <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> victims. On Aug. 25, a public council to supervise the construction and maintenance of the monument was formed, as well as an executive committee to submit a blueprint for the memorial's design. Among those selected for the public council were <PERSON> Solzhenitsyn </PERSON>, fellow dissident and Nobel Peace Prize laureate <PERSON> Andrei </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON>, poet <PERSON> Yevgeny </PERSON> <PERSON> Yevtushenko </PERSON> and <PERSON> Boris </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON>, the fiery former <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> party boss. <PERSON> Samadunov </PERSON>, a member of the executive committee, said the members of the public council were chosen in street polls conducted at two central <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> locations, as well as from names submitted by readers to <ORGANIZATION> Literaturnaya </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gazeta </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Ogonyok </PERSON> and other state-run publications. `` We chose the first 17 people mentioned, and <PERSON> Solzhenitsyn </PERSON> was among them,'' said <PERSON> Samadunov </PERSON> in a telephone interview. This week's edition of <ORGANIZATION> Moscow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> listed <PERSON> Solzhenitsyn </PERSON> as a member of the public council charged with building the memorial But <PERSON> Samadunov </PERSON> said the committee had not yet been able to notify <PERSON> Solzhenitsyn </PERSON> that he had been selected for the committee, or to determine whether he would agree to take part in its work. `` We sent him a telegram with news of his selection and that of the others, and asked his agreement, but the telegram was returned to us with a notice that it could not be delivered because the address was not precise enough,'' said <PERSON> Samadunov </PERSON>. <PERSON> Solzhenitsyn </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Natalya </PERSON>, said through a family spokesman that `` no telegram has been received,'' and that they will issue a public statement if they get it. She declined to say whether <PERSON> Solzhenitsyn </PERSON> would accept an invitation to serve on the committee. She previously has said the writer has no plans to visit the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. In June, the editor of the literary monthly Novy Mir said he was negotiating for the right to print <PERSON> Solzhenitsyn </PERSON>'s novel `` Cancer Ward,'' which would mark the first publication of a work by <PERSON> Solzhenitsyn </PERSON> in his native land since he was expelled.

<DATELINE>BELMAR, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Republican <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> kept up his attack on Democrat <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' environmental record, accusing the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor of seeking to pollute the waters of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> where sewage has closed beaches. In fiery remarks, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> stood on a sunny <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> beach and told supporters he has one question for his Democratic opponent: `` Why did you pledge a clean ocean to the people of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> when your own state applied to pollute it?'' Displaying the feisty campaign style he has recently adopted, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> shouted with disdain as he referred to a 1985 application from <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' as governor of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> to dump his state's waste in an ocean dump site 106 miles off <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>. `` For almost two years, he fought to allow <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>'s sludge to be dumped off <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>'s shore _ the very shore on which he had the nerve to stand and promise clean water. Nice guy _ yeah,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said sarcastically. He told the beach-clad crowd of supporters that if <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> comes to their shores on another campaign trip, `` Be sure to ask him, ` Why did you want to dump <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> sludge off our coast in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>?' A compromise allowed <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> to dump further out beyond the continental shelf. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was heckled by <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> supporters who chanted `` Where was <PERSON> George </PERSON>?'' and carried signs ridiculing the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> adminisration's <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> as being weak But the few hundred <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> supporters who had tickets to enter the roped off beach section where he spoke, drowned out the protesters with chants of `` We want <PERSON> George </PERSON>.'' At one point a plane flew over pulling a banner with the words, `` Where was <PERSON> Teddy </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>?'' It was the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> senator one who made the `` Where was <PERSON> George </PERSON>?'' line a Democratic rallying cry in his speech at the party's convention this summer. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> laughed when he saw the plane, saying, `` Where did that guy come from?'' Then he said, `` So I was home with <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON>. What's wrong with that?'' The remark appeared to be an oblique version to a quip making the rounds of Republican circles that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was home, dry and in bed with his wife, a pointed reference to the time <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> drove his car off a bridge at <LOCATION> Chappaquidick </LOCATION> after a party and a young woman passenger drowned. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told the crowd that `` nobody fools nature over the long run.'' He said he would fight `` to ban ocean dumping forever,'' and would `` make the enforcement of Superfund, the prosecution of polluters, and the cleanup of toxic waste a top priority.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was introduced by <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Kean </PERSON>, and later was met on a <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> stop by Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Castle </PERSON> and former Gov. <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> du </PERSON> <PERSON> Pont </PERSON>, who sought the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> presidential nomination earlier this year. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> wen to historical New Castle, <LOCATION> Del. </LOCATION>, for another environmental speech and a crabbling demonstration. In an interview with a group of outdoor reporters and editors <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who has been saying, `` I am an environmentalist'' at every campaign stop in recent days, said he was also a sportsman who has fished and hunted for years. `` Anybody who loves these outdoor sports as much as I do has to be concerned with clean water,'' he said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> avoided reporters' questions about <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' decision to re-hire <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sasso </PERSON>, a former campaign manager who quit last year because he distributed a videotape that helped drive <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Biden </PERSON> out of the Democratic presidential race. `` I have n't thought about it,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said at one point. But later, while bobbing around in boats in the <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> for a crabbing demonstration, reporters shouted questions about <PERSON> Sasso </PERSON> across the water. The vice president at first shook his head and then held up one of the crabs in the boat, saying, `` Speaking of crabs.''

<HEAD>Kentucky Replaces Road Signs Missing Governor's Middle Initial</HEAD>
<DATELINE>COVINGTON, Ky. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> wants signs welcoming travelers at all highway points of entry to be letter perfect. So it is replacing some that dropped the middle initial `` G'' from Gov. <PERSON> Wallace </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilkinson </PERSON>'s name. Transportation Secretary <PERSON> Milo </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bryant </PERSON> said failing to use the `` G'' _ for <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> _ in the governor's name amounts to misspelling the name. `` Obviously, it's not correct. That's not his name that he was sworn in as governor,'' <PERSON> Bryant </PERSON> said. The error occurred earlier this year, <PERSON> Bryant </PERSON> said. He said an alert supervisor noticed that workers were leaving out the `` G.'' The signs the department has made since the discovery bear the initial. <PERSON> Bryant </PERSON> estimated only 10-12 signs are being changed, at a cost of perhaps $ 44 for each. He was unsure of labor costs and other expenses in the replacement project, but said it might be in the $ 200 to $ 300 range. `` It was not a big deal,'' <PERSON> Bryant </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, who recently saw a crew of three men and two trucks working to remove one of the signs on the Suspension Bridge between <PERSON> Covington </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION>, said he thought the action `` was a waste of money.'' `` I figure the money they used on that could have gone out here to help the poor people on the street,'' said <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, a 43-year-old retiree from the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> who rarely uses his middle initial _ `` H'' for <PERSON> Henry </PERSON>. Who ordered the change is unclear. <PERSON> Bryant </PERSON> said he was n't sure. He said he did not receive instructions from the governor or his staff to change them. `` I doubt the governor even knows about it,'' he said.

<HEAD>Anti-Drinking Campaign, Chernobyl Put Soviet Budget in the Red</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s anti-drinking campaign and the <LOCATION> Chernobyl </LOCATION> nuclear plant accident have helped put the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> budget in the red by `` many billions of rubles,'' an economist reported Friday. <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bochkov </PERSON>, writing in the newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Sovietskaya </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rossiya </ORGANIZATION>, said many specialists estimate the deficit as equal to 15 percent to 17 percent of state revenues. The economist did not give a specific figure, but said the Soviet deficit was `` many billions of rubles,'' an amount he said was nearly half of what is being spent to meet the country's social and cultural needs. The <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s policy-making <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, in a July plenary meeting, said that when next year's state budget and economic plan are drawn up it will be necessary to take decisive steps to cut the deficit. The 1988 government budget, as approved by the Supreme Soviet parliament in October, totals $ 773 billion. In his article, <PERSON> Bochkov </PERSON> specifically noted $ 66 billion in unforeseen expenses or revenue shortfalls: _ Lower world prices for oil and oil products, a major Soviet export item, have led to a $ 23 billion drop in foreign income. _ Slashes in the production of vodka and other alcoholic drinks, a key measure in <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s 3-year-old anti-drinking campaign, have resulted in a $ 30 billion drop in state revenue from alcohol sales. _ Finally, an additional $ 12.6 billion have been spent to cope with the aftermath of the 1986 nuclear reactor explosion and fire at the <LOCATION> Chernobyl </LOCATION> power plant, which sparked the evacuation of more than 130,000 residents of the northern <LOCATION> Ukraine </LOCATION> and southern <LOCATION> Byelorussia </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bochkov </PERSON> said that more than 70 percent of Soviet national income is redistributed through the state budget. In line with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s drive to make each sector of the Soviet economy self-sufficient, <PERSON> Bochkov </PERSON> called for a decisive move to self-financing However, many Soviet factories and enterprises are still far from being able to stand on their own feet and meet expenses through their own revenues, and depend on periodic injections of government funds. <PERSON> Bochkov </PERSON> said Soviet warehouses and store shelves are now clogged with $ 746 billion in goods that no one wants to buy, and since the products remain unsold, the state earns no revenue from them. In his article, the economist also issued an indirect call for slimmed-down defense spending, saying: `` As in any sector of the expenditure of budgetary resources, in the military sector there is also the possibility of economy.'' The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s 1988 budget officially allocates $ 32 billion for defense, but Western analysts contend actual Soviet military spending is many times that figure.

 The director of the school lunch program in <LOCATION> Hempstead </LOCATION> allegedly stole hundreds of pounds of cheese and other food donated by the federal government and used it at his cafe, authorities said Friday. <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Eveleno </PERSON>, 56, of <LOCATION> Greenlawn </LOCATION>, was arrested on a federal complaint following an investigation begun in April after an inspector on a routine sanitation inspection is said to have discovered 320 pounds of <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> food at <ORGANIZATION> Eveleno </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> restaurant The food included large commercial packages of American and mozzarella cheese, raisins, vegetables, butter, honey, instant mashed potatoes and refried beans. Eveleno, who was employed by a private food service company under contract to the <ORGANIZATION> Hempstead </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> to run its cafeterias, owns the <ORGANIZATION> Backstage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cafe </ORGANIZATION>, a food concession at the <ORGANIZATION> East </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Side </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Comedy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Huntington </LOCATION>, according to the complaint.

<HEAD>Israel Holds Amal Responsible For Captured Airman</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The Israeli army said Friday it was working for the speedy release of an air navigator captured in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> last year and that it holds the Lebanese Amal militia responsible for his health. A statement from the military command read to reporters by telephone said <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> questioned the `` credibility and source'' of recent reports from <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> that the navigator <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Arad </PERSON>, 30, was in poor health. But it said: `` <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> stresses and reiterates it considers the Amal organization, and its leader, -LRB- Lebanese Justice Minister -RRB- <PERSON> Nabih </PERSON> <PERSON> Berri </PERSON>, responsible for the health and safety of the navigator and hopes all necessary steps will be taken in keeping with this responsibility. `` <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> will continue to work to return the navigator safe and sound as soon as possible,'' said the statement, which also was broadcast by <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION>. Lebanese miltiamen shot down <PERSON> Arad </PERSON>'s phantom fighter with a shoulder-launched SAM-7 missile during an Oct. 16 bombing mission in <LOCATION> south </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. The pilot was rescued by helicopter. After his capture, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> announced that <PERSON> Arad </PERSON> was being held by <ORGANIZATION> Amal </ORGANIZATION>, a Shiite Moslem group and rival to the pro-Iranian <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION>. The army's statement follows a radio appeal by <PERSON> Arad </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Tami </PERSON>, who said she and their 3-year-old daughter had not received any information about her husband in more than a year. `` The hardest thing is the uncertainty and lack of contact,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Arad </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION> on July 21. `` If I could only know how he is, and what he does, and whether he's in good health, it would be easier.'' She also urged her husband to be strong. `` We shall do everything so that we can be together soon,'' she said. `` We believe in you and cross our fingers for you.'' Five other Israelis are missing in action in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. Two, captured in 1986, are believed held by <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>. Three others have been reported missing since a tank battle with Syrian forces in eastern <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> on June 11, 1982.

<HEAD>More MK-6 Rafts Fail Tests, Report Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> has found more MK-6 inflatable life boats that failed to operate properly as the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> continues to investigate a <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> company that produced the rafts, according to a published report. A <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> official who spoke on condition he not be identified confirmed Friday that a small number of the 25-man rafts were tested and that some had safety defects, which he did not identify. The spokesman, however, said he could not confirm a report in <LOCATION> The </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION> Press that each life boat failed the testing. `` Indeed we have started testing the MK-6,'' he said. `` Some of the safety problems ... have been found in the small number that have been tested. I ca n't say each one'' had safety defects. The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> is informing its fleet and is organizing an effort to deal with the problems, the spokesman said. `` Our inspector general has been seriously involved with concerns over the safety of the MK-6 and definitely is soliciting inputs from all the involved agencies in the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>,'' he said. The spokesman said each of those tested was produced by <ORGANIZATION> Rubber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Crafters </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Grantsville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> W. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Va </LOCATION> The company's offices and factory were raided Aug. 8 by agents of the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Criminal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investigative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investigation </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Naval </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investigative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. The newspaper reported at the time that the agents seized records but made no arrests. Company officials declined comment. An affidavit filed in connection with a search warrant obtained by the investigators claimed that Rubber Crafters supplied 63 defective MK-6 rafts to the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> in 1986. The document claimed that Rubber Crafters used inferior materials, falsified test results and altered boat serial numbers in an effort to hide the defects. The investigators found four suspect rafts in <LOCATION> Norfolk </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, and a small number of others were found during within the last two days at <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Mare </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, The <ORGANIZATION> Pittsburgh </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> said. Rubber Crafters was paid more than $ 17 million and made nearly 2,150 MK-6 boats since 1984, when it won the supply contract from <PERSON> B.F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Goodrich </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> has about 12,500 of the boats, which are stocked with water, medical gear and other survival supplies.

 The <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign tried to hire an employee of the <ORGANIZATION> Voice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> to translate statements by the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> nominee into Greek for <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' natural constituency of Greek-American voters, according to agency documents and personnel. The overture to an editor at the federally financed overseas radio network prompted the <ORGANIZATION> VOA </ORGANIZATION>'s general counsel to issue a memorandum warning eployees against violating the 1939 Hatch Act, which bars federal workers from taking part in partisan political activities. <ORGANIZATION> VOA </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Judy </PERSON> <PERSON> Jamison </PERSON> said the agency's chief lawyer `` was prepared to recommend against'' accepting the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign's job offer, but never did because the editor said he was n't interested in taking The employee, <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bistis </PERSON>, said in a memo that he received a call Aug. 23 offering him an eight-week assignment translating several texts of news about <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> or statements by him that were intended for Greek-Americans. In the memo, a copy of which was obtained by The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Bistis </PERSON> said he told the caller, <PERSON> Eva </PERSON> <PERSON> Neterowicz </PERSON>, that believed such an assignment would violate the Hatch Act. `` She answered that in her opinion there is no conflict because the job offered involved translating services rather than engaging in political activity,'' <PERSON> Bistis </PERSON> said. `` After all, she remarked, other people at <ORGANIZATION> VOA </ORGANIZATION> are working for us and they do n't seem to think that there is any conflict with the Hatch Act,'' <PERSON> Bistis </PERSON> quoted her as saying. Ms. <PERSON> Neterowicz </PERSON>, chief of the nationalities department of the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign, confirmed in an interview that she had tried to hire <ORGANIZATION> VOA </ORGANIZATION> employees for part-time jobs providing translations for 26 ethnic groups, including Greek-Americans, at $ 50 per text. She said that `` we were told there was no problem'' with hiring <ORGANIZATION> VOA </ORGANIZATION> personnel. But she said all her translators currently are from private business and none is from the <ORGANIZATION> VOA </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Bistis </PERSON>' supervisor, <PERSON> Andreas </PERSON> <PERSON> Antypas </PERSON>, deputy chief of <ORGANIZATION> VOA </ORGANIZATION>'s European division, wrote the congressional <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> giving details of the incident and mentioning the case of another employee from the <ORGANIZATION> VOA </ORGANIZATION>'s Hungarian service who had performed translations for the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign `` I find it highly objectionable that any political organization should feel free to fish around in the <ORGANIZATION> VOA </ORGANIZATION> for translators of partisan political material,'' <PERSON> Antypas </PERSON> wrote. <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> official <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Atkins </PERSON> said he relayed the Antypas memo to the general counsel of the congressional watchdog agency. <ORGANIZATION> VOA </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Jamison </PERSON> said the agency receives dozens of requests for translators because many of its employees are multilingual. `` In this case, of course, it was different because we're talking about a political campaign,'' she said. She said she did not know of any other agency employees who were approached by the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign, but said a <ORGANIZATION> VOA </ORGANIZATION> engineer had asked for a three-month leave to work for the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign. The <ORGANIZATION> VOA </ORGANIZATION> general counsel's memo said there may be `` very limited and specific'' cases in which outside jobs associated with partisan politics are permissible. But he said employees must receive his written approval in advance before accepting them.

<HEAD>Labor Secretary: Economy Good Despite Unemployment Rise</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Unemployment Bjt</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARK PERKISS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The American work force is in its best shape ever, despite a drop in manufacturing jobs and a dramatic slowdown in service industry hiring, <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> McLaughlin </PERSON> said Friday. `` Employment is still at record levels and that's good,'' Ms. <PERSON> McLaughlin </PERSON> said in the second State of the Workforce address, delivered before the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION>. Her predecessor, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Brock </PERSON>, gave the first such address in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> last year. `` The state of the work force in 1988 is good and getting better _ the best it has ever been. But it is n't as good as it can be,'' she said. `` If workers, managers, government and unions can cooperate ... we can offer a job to everyone in this country who wants one _ provided they're educated, skilled and prepared for the workplace,'' Ms. <PERSON> McLaughlin </PERSON> said. The key labor issue is no longer unemployment, it's the unemployable, she said. `` In the future, more than ever before, the unemployed will be the underskilled,'' she said. Ms. <PERSON> McLaughlin </PERSON>'s speech followed the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s release Friday of unemployment figures for August, which showed the nation's jobless rate rose to 5.6 percent last month. It was the second straight monthly increase. The July rate of 5.4 percent was 0.1 higher than June's 5.3 percent, a 14-year low. Ms. <PERSON> McLaughlin </PERSON> said the jobless rate had been fluctuating between 5.3 percent and 5.6 percent since March. She praised the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration for creating 17 million new jobs in the past five years and called for efforts to educate and train workers with and without jobs. `` The day must never come when we have a worker deficit in this country because we've failed as a nation to provide opportunities for excellence and relevance in education, training and retraining,'' she said. Ms. <PERSON> McLaughlin </PERSON> left out attacks on the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> in a departure from her prepared text, which contained a reference to Democrats in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> who in 1982 tried to pass what she called `` a costly public jobs program'' with a $ 3.5 million price tag. She also did not mention Democratic presidential candidate <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> by name, referring to him only as `` the other candidate'' in acknowledging his endorsement last week by the <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION>, an endorsement supported by the <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> federation. But Ms. <PERSON> McLaughlin </PERSON> criticized the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor as `` not terribly economically astute and literate'' at a news conference after her speech. In 1983, she said <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> lost 45,000 manufacturing jobs while 1 million jobs were created nationwide. The <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> reported the goods-producing side of the economy lost jobs in August for the first time since last January. Employment in manufacturing was down by 5,000 after a 70,000 jump in July. <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Estrich </PERSON>, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>'s campaign manager, said from <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> that the loss of those jobs was a `` blow to hopes for prosperity in the nation's heartland -LRB- and -RRB- to hopes of easing the squeeze on working Americans.''

<HEAD>NLRB Files Complaint Against Writers Guild</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> has filed a complaint seeking to invalidate <ORGANIZATION> Writers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guild </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> rules that limit members' ability to quit the union during a strike. `` It's like an indictment. We are a prosecutor alleging a violation of the law,'' said <PERSON> Sidney </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosen </PERSON>, a regional <ORGANIZATION> NLRB </ORGANIZATION> officer. The unfair labor practices complaint, filed Thursday, supports an action filed by 21 dissident members of the <ORGANIZATION> WGA </ORGANIZATION> during the guild's 154-day strike against movie and television producers. The strike, one of the longest in entertainment industry history, ended last month. The dissidents and the <ORGANIZATION> NLRB </ORGANIZATION> argue that the guild's constitution illegally allows the union to fine writers for working during a strike even if the writers resign from the union before going back to work. The complaint called for a Nov. 3 hearing before an administrative law judge in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, and could eventually lead to a hearing before the labor board in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> WGA </ORGANIZATION> officers said they had n't been served with the complaint. In a statement, however, the guild said it expects to prevail in the lawsuit before the <ORGANIZATION> NLRB </ORGANIZATION> `` or on appeal to the federal courts, if necessary.'' The guild also argued that the issue is moot now that the strike is over. <PERSON> Lionel </PERSON> <PERSON> Chetwynd </PERSON>, one of the 21 writers who signed the original complaint, said a guild official recently urged the dissidents to drop their complaint. But he disputed the notion that the complaint is hurting the guild. `` Clearly, there are deep problems with the guild. You could look at this as a first step in clearing away the debris, and getting our constitution in line with the law of the land,'' <PERSON> Chetwynd </PERSON> said Thursday.

 A <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> Highway Patrol make-believe training memo about <ORGANIZATION> Sandinista </ORGANIZATION> terrorists waging war on law enforcement officers made it into the hands of <LOCATION> Metro-Dade </LOCATION> police, who took it very seriously. So seriously that <ORGANIZATION> Metro-Dade </ORGANIZATION>'s intelligence unit issued a memo of their own, in which they warned officers to be wary of a feared Nicaraguan gang, suspected in the March shooting death of <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> police Officer <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Estefan </PERSON>. `` The attached memorandum from the <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Highway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Patrol </ORGANIZATION> infers that members fo the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinista </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> ... will utilize deadly force against law enforcement officers who come in contact with them,'' the Aug. 11 <ORGANIZATION> Metro-Dade </ORGANIZATION> memo said. `` Due to the large population of Nicaraguans in <LOCATION> Dade </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, the probability of contact with these subjects is great,'' said the memo, which was read to all members of the force at roll call. Oops, <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> Highway Patrol Sgt. <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Farrow </PERSON> said Thursday when told the creative training memo made it to <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>. `` This was not intended to go nationwide and scare people over the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Farrow </PERSON> said. `` It's a training bulletin for our guys.

 Clinging to her 16-month-old daughter after the flight they were on went down, <PERSON> Tammy </PERSON> <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> was paralyzed by confusion and fear. `` Someone was hollering, ` It's gon na blow! It's gon na blow!' ... And I knew that I wanted her out and alive. That's why I passed her out to that man,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON>. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON>, 37, of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Monroe </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> La. </LOCATION>, and her daughter, <PERSON> Sarah </PERSON>, were passengers on the ill-fated <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> Flight 1141, which crashed at takeoff Wednesday at <LOCATION> Dallas-Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>, killing 13 people. Ninety-five others survived. `` That man'' was fellow passenger <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON>, who had scrambled out a gaping hole in the top of the <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 727, reached back into the smoldering wreckage for the baby and slid down the fuselage with <PERSON> Sarah </PERSON> cradled under one arm. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> then managed to get out herself. <PERSON> Sarah </PERSON> was the youngest survivor of the crash, and suffered only minor injuries. She did n't even cry, her mother said. `` I'm just very thankful because I know without -LRB- King's -RRB- help, I would not have gotten her to fresh air,'' <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> said Thursday at <ORGANIZATION> Harris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Methodist </ORGANIZATION> H.E.B. Hospital, where she was recovering from smoke inhalation. `` Thanks to him, she does n't have any scars. `` I think he deserves a gold medal,'' <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> added. `` I consider him a hero. He was concerned about someone else, not only himself.'' King, whose left index finger was almost severed when it caught on something as he and <PERSON> Sarah </PERSON> slid to safety, does n't see it that way. Initially, he declined to speak to reporters because, as he said later, he had n't done anything extraordinary. `` I do n't think there's anything heroic to it,'' said <PERSON> King </PERSON>, 38, a <LOCATION> Carrollton </LOCATION> veterinarian with two young children of his own. `` You're there and it's got to be done and you just do it. I was just glad to be able to help somebody.'' King, released from <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> hospital Thursday, said he looks at the world differently now. `` You think of all the things that could have happened. And to realize they did n't ... there's a lot to be thankful for,'' he said. `` Every day is better now.'' <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> shares his sentiments, especially after playing the details in her mind over and over. `` The good Lord helped us out,'' she said. `` He was there holding my hand. I guess it was n't our time.'' `` Every time I see the plane I ca n't believe we were in it.''

<HEAD>800,000-Ton Corn Sale Reported</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has bought an additional 800,000 metric tons of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> corn for delivery during the 1988-89 marketing year that began Thursday, the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Friday. Sale of 100,000 tons of corn was announced a day earlier, also for delivery in 1988-89. A metric ton is about 2,205 pounds and is equal to 39.4 bushels of corn or 36.7 bushels of wheat or soybeans. The 900,000 tons of corn would be about 35.5 million bushels. Corn prices have been averaging about $ 2.49 per bushel at the farm level, meaning that the two sales could have a farm value of around $ 88.4 million. There was no indication whether the new sales of corn would count under the current long-term grain supply agreement between the two countries or be carried forward separately in case a new pact is forthcoming. The current five-year pact is set to expire Sept. 30 and negotiators are currently trying to work out a new one, or at least an extension of the current agreement, to take effect Oct. 1. <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Homann </PERSON> of the department's <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said it would be determined later how to count the latest corn sales, depending on the actual shipping dates and whether there is a new agreement. Regardless, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has already lived up to terms of the final year of the agreement, which calls for the annual purchase of at least 9 million tons of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> grain. According to the agreement, the annual purchases are supposed to include a minimum of 4 million tons each of wheat and corn. The Soviets have the option of buying the remaining 1 million tons as wheat, corn or soybeans, with every ton of beans counting as two tons of grain _ up to a maximum of 1 million tons of grain equivalent. Prior to this week's sales, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> had purchased 9.05 million tons of wheat and 5.17 million tons of corn for delivery in the fifth year of the agreement, plus 830,000 tons of soybeans and 1.3 million tons of soybean meal.

 The government said Friday leftist guerrillas will be allowed to present their ideas on political, economic and social change to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> if they accept a cease-fire. President <PERSON> Virgilio </PERSON> <PERSON> Barco </PERSON> outlined the proposal in a televised address Thursday night and Government Minister <PERSON> Cesar </PERSON> <PERSON> Gaviria </PERSON> gave details Friday. <PERSON> Barco </PERSON> said guerrilla violence must end before direct contacts are made.

Over the past year the guerrillas have blown up oil pipelines 45 times, attacked 14 towns, set off car bombs, attacked military bases, ambushed army patrols and destroyed bridges, electricity transmission towers and other government facilities. They have kidnapped dozens of ranchers for ransom since the early 1980s and also have a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> captive _ <PERSON> Jake </PERSON> <PERSON> Gambini </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tex. </LOCATION>, owner of <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pipe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co </ORGANIZATION>. He was kidnapped two months ago from an oil company camp in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s eastern plains but there have been no reports of ransom demands. <PERSON> Gaviria </PERSON>, who is in charge of internal security, said preliminary contacts with guerrillas can begin as soon as they end hostilities. After the cease-fire and initial contacts, the rebels would be allowed to give <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> their proposals for change, the minister said in an interview with the <ORGANIZATION> RCN </ORGANIZATION> radio network. <PERSON> Barco </PERSON> said Thursday night the peace plan's objective was disbanding the guerrilla groups, and he repeated an amnesty offer made last month. This is the second time a <LOCATION> Colombian </LOCATION> government has tried to negotiate with the insurgents. In 1982, President <PERSON> Belisario </PERSON> <PERSON> Betancur </PERSON> offered an amnesty and signed a truce with four of <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s six rebel armies. Only about 300 guerrillas accepted pardons and the cease-fire collapsed, with rebels and the military accusing each other of violating it. Barco's plan differs in two important aspects _ provisions for direct negotiations with the government and submission of guerrilla proposals to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Betancur </PERSON> met with guerrilla representatives twice but his negotiators were not government officials, which led the rebels to suspect he did not take the process seriously. <PERSON> Gaviria </PERSON> said the proporsed negotations would be handled by himself and <PERSON> Barco </PERSON>'s personal representative for guerrilla contacts, <PERSON> Rafael </PERSON> <PERSON> Pardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Rueda </PERSON>, who was appointed last year and has met with guerrilla leaders several times. No guerrilla reaction is expected for several days. <PERSON> Gaviria </PERSON> said the insurgents were not given details in advance.

 <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, gearing up for `` a very tough, very competitive'' general election campaign, announced Friday he was rehiring <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sasso </PERSON>, his longtime political strategist who resigned after anonymously triggering events that forced Sen. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Biden </PERSON> out of the Democratic primary campaign. `` It's going to be a battle royal for the presidency of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said, announcing that his pugnacious former campaign manager was returning as vice chairman of his campaign. <PERSON> Sasso </PERSON>'s return came as Republican opponent <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> kept pounding away at the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor, and amid polls that showed <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> were locked in a dead-heat with the Labor Day campaign kickoff just days away. Standing on a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> beach Friday, the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> nominee accused <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> of contributing to its occasional pollution by arranging to have sludge from <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> dumped in nearby ocean waters. `` Almost a year ago, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sasso </PERSON> made a very serious mistake,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. `` He's paid the price.'' <PERSON> Sasso </PERSON> stepped down last year after admitting that he distributed a videotape showing that Sen. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Biden </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION>, then a candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination, had borrowed virtually verbatim excerpts from a speech once delivered by British <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> Kinnock </PERSON>. That videotape and subsequent charges of plagiarism forced <PERSON> Biden </PERSON> to drop out of the race. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said <PERSON> Biden </PERSON> `` could not have been more gracious'' when told that <PERSON> Sasso </PERSON> was returning to his campaign. <PERSON> Biden </PERSON>, in a statement issued by his <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> office, said, `` I continue to support Governor <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Sasso </PERSON>, speaking at a news conference in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> with campaign chairman <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Brountas </PERSON> and manager <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Estrich </PERSON>, apologized for the incident and said he did not intend to raise questions about <PERSON> Biden </PERSON>'s character. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has seen his double-digit lead over <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in the polls evaporate since the Republican National Convention last month, when the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> launched a sustained attack on the Democratic nominee. Nevertheless, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said <PERSON> Sasso </PERSON>'s return was not a reflection of disarray in his campaign. `` It's simply the fact we're looking at a little more than two months of what is going to be a very tough, very competitive campaign,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said, adding that he wanted to assemble `` the strongest team I possibly can.'' <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> Fuller </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s chief of staff, said the return of <PERSON> Sasso </PERSON> `` speaks for itself.'' But <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> vice presidential nominee <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> was more blunt: `` I would say that this is another sign that the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign is in serious trouble.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> stood Friday before a group of supporters clad in beach attire to keep up his attack on <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' environmental record. `` For almost two years, he fought to allow <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>'s sludge to be dumped off <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>'s shore _ the very shore on which he had the nerve to stand and promise clean water,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` Nice guy _ yeah.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> spoke on a beach at <LOCATION> Belmar </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, which has been closed from time to time because of sludge that was dumped off the coast and then drifted ashore. `` Why did you pledge a clean ocean to the people of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> when your own state applied to pollute it?'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> asked. While <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> applied in 1985 to have his state's sludge dumped 106 miles off the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> coast, a later agreement allowed <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> to unload it farther out to sea, beyond the continental shelf. Earlier in the week, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> sailed into heavily polluted <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION> and accused <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> of neglect and stalling and doing too little to clean up the waters of his own home port. The vice president appears intent on wooing members of <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' own Greek-American constituency A <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign official tried without success to recruit an employee of the federally financed <ORGANIZATION> Voice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> to translate the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> candidate's speeches and statements into Greek. The employee, <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bistis </PERSON>, did not accept the offer, and the <ORGANIZATION> VOA </ORGANIZATION> general counsel warned in a memorandum that any <ORGANIZATION> VOA </ORGANIZATION> staffer taking such an assignment would be violating the Hatch Act, which bars federal workers from taking part in partisan political campaigns. `` I find it highly objectionable that any political organization should feel free to fish around in the <ORGANIZATION> VOA </ORGANIZATION> for translators of partisan political material,'' <PERSON> Andreas </PERSON> <PERSON> Antypas </PERSON>, deputy chief of <ORGANIZATION> VOA </ORGANIZATION>'s European division, wrote in a memo obtained by The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>.

<TEXT>
 Playing a good guy is something new for actor <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahoney </PERSON>, who has been in a veritable movie whirlwind for the last year. The actor has turned up as the sinister judge in `` Suspect,'' the drink-splashed teacher in `` Moonstruck,'' a bumbling <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> consul in `` Frantic'' and a white supremacist farmer in `` Betrayal.'' Now, he is <PERSON> Kid </PERSON> <PERSON> Gleason </PERSON>, the manager of the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sox </ORGANIZATION>, in <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sayles </PERSON>' new movie, `` Eight Men Out.'' `` He's a very decent man, and I have n't got to play too many of those,'' noted the Chicago-based actor. <PERSON> Mahoney </PERSON> said he is n't certain why he often is cast as an unsavory character, but thinks it may have something to do with the role that first brought him to attention in the East. His <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> stage debut was in `` Orphans,'' in a role that <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Finney </PERSON> later portrayed in the film version: `` A man you could believe could smack you in two if he wanted to, but he was also a very loving person.'' After filming `` Eight Men Out,'' <PERSON> Mahoney </PERSON> is back to his old tricks: playing a father who tries to break up his daughter's romance in a movie called `` Say Anything,'' and `` a rotten, slimy character'' in a mini-series called `` Favorite Son.

 A man drove his estranged wife's body to police headquarters early Friday and demanded that he be arrested, authorities said <PERSON> Ruhle </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pollard </PERSON>, 36, was distraught when he arrived at the City-County Building about 4 a.m. and told a sheriff's dispatcher that he wanted to be arrested on an outstanding warrant, said <LOCATION> Clark </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Sheriff <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Becher </PERSON>. Dispatcher <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Goodlet </PERSON> could find no warrant for <PERSON> Pollard </PERSON> and refused to arrest him. <PERSON> Pollard </PERSON> then told <PERSON> Goodlet </PERSON> to shoot him, <PERSON> Becher </PERSON> said. `` He told Officer Goodlet that if he was n't going to shoot him and he was n't going to arrest him on the warrant, he -LRB- <PERSON> Goodlet </PERSON> -RRB- should go out to the parking lot _ that his wife was dead in the back seat of his car and that he had strangled her,'' the sheriff said.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Adolph </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and its local distributor on Friday sued a man who claimed to have found a mouse in a 16-ounce can of Coors beer. The lawsuit filed in <ORGANIZATION> Duval </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> accuses <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> of fraud and deceit, product disparagement, defamation and attempted theft by deception in connection with his claims. The lawsuit, which says tests have shown the mouse did not enter the can at the brewery, also accuses the <LOCATION> Jacksonville </LOCATION> man of `` intentional interference with advantageous business relationships.'' No specific cash amount is demanded in the suit. `` What has happened to Coors should not happen to anyone,'' said <PERSON> Cary </PERSON> <PERSON> Baird </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Coors </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman at company headquarters in <LOCATION> Golden </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colo. </LOCATION> `` The public recognition of <ORGANIZATION> Coors </ORGANIZATION>' commitment to quality products and consumer satisfaction is the company's most valuable asset, and <ORGANIZATION> Coors </ORGANIZATION>, and its <LOCATION> Jacksonville </LOCATION> distributor, <PERSON> Neal </PERSON> <PERSON> Tyler </PERSON> and Sons, have incurred severe damage as a result of this incident,'' she said. Coors would have no further comment on the incident until the matter is settled in court, she added. <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON>, whose telephone number is unlisted, could not be reached for comment, and his attorney <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Pajcic </PERSON> was out of town and unavailable. <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON>, 30, a construction worker, has said he purchased a can of Coors July 27 at a <LOCATION> Jacksonville </LOCATION> liquor store, took a few sips and became ill. On Aug. 3, <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> took the can to the <ORGANIZATION> Jacksonville </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> to have the lid removed, and a six-inch mouse was discovered After <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> reported the find to <ORGANIZATION> Coors </ORGANIZATION>, the company offered him $ 1,500 for the can and its contents so they could be analyzed. <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> refused, demanding $ 30,000 to $ 50,000, <ORGANIZATION> Coors </ORGANIZATION> said. <ORGANIZATION> Coors </ORGANIZATION> sued <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> for the right to analyze the can and its contents, and a judge ordered an autopsy on the mouse and allowed <ORGANIZATION> Coors </ORGANIZATION> to take the can to <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> for tests. Ms. <PERSON> Baird </PERSON> said Aug. 18 that an examination of the mouse by a <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> veterinary pathologist found the animal had been dead for only a short time, while the beer can had been sealed in <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> 77 days before the rodent was found. She said that proved that the mouse did not get into the can at the brewery. The UF examination also noted abrasions on the mouse's sides A pathologist hired by <PERSON> Pajcic </PERSON> said the assumptions made by <ORGANIZATION> Coors </ORGANIZATION> on the basis of the autopsy were not necessary correct, and that the alcohol in the beer could have preserved the mouse, thus making it impossible to determine when it died.

<HEAD>Sandinista Leader Says Rebels Beaten But U.S. Threat Remains</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SAN JACINTO, Nicaragua (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 U.S.-backed rebels have been defeated but the Sandinista government will maintain its large army because of the threat of an invasion by American troops, the defense minister said Friday. <PERSON> Humberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> said the rebels are `` strategically defeated'' but the government will not reduce it 80,000-member Armed Forces, the biggest in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. `` We ca n't have a lesser level,'' he said, citing the presence of rebel units across the border in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> and what he called the threat of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military intervention. <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> said the rebels, known as Contras, were in an `` irreversible situation'' with no hope for victory. The Contras began fighting the leftist government in 1981. The Sandinistas came to power in July 1979 in the civil war that ousted President <PERSON> Anastasio </PERSON> <PERSON> Somoza </PERSON> after 42 years of rule by the <PERSON> Somoza </PERSON> family. <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> spoke with reporters after addressing a crowd of soldiers at an Army Day ceremony. With him at <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jacinto </LOCATION>, 25 miles north of the capital of <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION>, were his brother, President <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON>, Vice President <PERSON> Sergio </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramirez </PERSON> and Agrarian Reform Minister <PERSON> Jaime </PERSON> <PERSON> Wheelock </PERSON>. The defense minister said the rebels still hoped to obtain renewed <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military aid, cut off at the end of February, and that the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration was attempting to provoke a conflict between Honduran and Nicaraguan troops to justify direct American military intervention. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> sent more than 3,000 soldiers to <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> in March in response to a Sandinistas border crossing into <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>, but then withdrew the troops. <PERSON> Enrique </PERSON> <PERSON> Bermudez </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Contra </ORGANIZATION> directors, said Friday that a loss of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> support for the rebels `` could mean the blood of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> soldiers.'' A transcript of a rebel <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberaction </ORGANIZATION> broadcast quoted <PERSON> Bermudez </PERSON> as saying the Contras `` are fighting for democracy in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>.'' Most of the rebels fled during the past four months across the northern border to base camps in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> provides non-lethal aid to the Contras at the camps. The Sandinistas and the Contras signed a cease-fire pact March 23. But high-level talks to work out the mechanics of a permanent truce in the 7-year-old war stalemated in June. Both sides accuse the other of violating the March agreement to suspend offensive military operations. The defense minister said that the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> were ready to renew the talks but that they had to be held in <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION>, the capital. The Contras refuse to return to <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION>, saying they were barred from circulating freely. <PERSON> Humbero </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> repeated the Sandinista government's estimate that there are 6,000 Contras and he said 70 percent of them were in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>. Rebel officials say more than 10,000 combatants are in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> and about 2,000 remain in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Dakota Men Calendar Sponsors Accused Of Fraud</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BOB IMRIE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BISMARCK, N.D. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Sponsors of a calendar that featured photos of young, single Dakotas farmers squandered profits on parties rather than keeping a promise to funnel money to financially strapped farmers, the state attorney general said Friday. A lawsuit filed in state district court accused the sponsors of the `` Dakota Men'' calendar of fraud. It seeks to stop sales of the calendar's 1989 edition, freeze the assets of the sponsors' corporation and stop the corporation from claiming non-profit status, said Attorney General <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Spaeth </PERSON> He said an audit of the sponsors organization turned up `` some very questionable transactions.'' `` It is clear that a lot of this money went for elaborate parties, -LRB- at -RRB- which <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> Men were present, -LRB- and -RRB- a lot of food and liquor,'' <PERSON> Spaeth </PERSON> said at a news conference. `` It is clear that, at best, this organization and its principals never made any serious effort to fulfill any charitable purposes,'' <PERSON> Spaeth </PERSON> said. One of the defendants, <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaeger </PERSON>, denied wrongdoing in a telephone interview Friday from the group's office in <LOCATION> Fargo </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Jaeger </PERSON> is former head of the sponsors' non-profit corporation, <ORGANIZATION> FOOD </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, or Farmers of Ongoing Determination. `` We have been operating a good business,'' <PERSON> Jaeger </PERSON> said. FOOD was started in 1986 to solicit charitable contributions to raise money to retrain displaced farmers, help them deal with the stress of tough times and make grants for such things as food and clothing, <PERSON> Spaeth </PERSON> said. A letter printed on the cover of the 1989 calendar, which sells for $ 8.95, claims the corporation has `` returned money to farm relief organizations helping farmers cope with the stress of their business and providing scholarships, job retraining, and immediate food, clothing and shelter.'' But evidence indicates the calendar's sponsors personally profited by the sales, <PERSON> Spaeth </PERSON> said. He also alleged the sponsors used a <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> company to skim off some of the profits. The lawsuit seeks restitution for all `` misappropriated money,'' which <PERSON> Spaeth </PERSON> said could total as much as $ 40,000. Defendants in the lawsuit include FOOD and <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaeger </PERSON>, <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaeger </PERSON>, <PERSON> Perry </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, <PERSON> Ruth </PERSON> <PERSON> Elbert </PERSON> and <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> Tyndall </PERSON>. The <PERSON> Jaegers </PERSON> and <PERSON> Elbert </PERSON> are siblings, said <PERSON> Spaeth </PERSON>, who called the defendants a `` very, very tight-knit group of people.'' For the year ending in April, FOOD earned $ 175,508 in total revenues, but no money was contributed to charity, <PERSON> Spaeth </PERSON> said. Since April, FOOD has given $ 2,000 to the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dakota </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Spaeth </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaeger </PERSON> said Friday his organization had made no other contributions. `` That is getting at questions I ca n't answer at this time. There is a reason.'' The calendars feature a farmer, from <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> each month. <PERSON> Jaeger </PERSON> is `` Mr. February'' on the 1988 calendar. The accompanying copy beneath his photo says in part: `` Look deep into his eyes, and you see a man who appreciates women, honesty, dependability and a good reputation.'' Evidence indicates that <PERSON> Tyndall </PERSON> set up her own company in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> KMGL </ORGANIZATION>, and arranged for FOOD to buy the <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> Men calendars from it, <PERSON> Spaeth </PERSON> said. `` In reality, <ORGANIZATION> KMGL </ORGANIZATION> did nothing other than subcontract the work out to a <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> printing company,'' <PERSON> Spaeth </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Tyndall </PERSON> billed FOOD for $ 60,226, while work done by the printing company cost $ 52,306, he said.

 An <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> plane had to abort its takeoff when it hit and killed two deer that bounded out of the woods adjacent to a runway, an official said Friday. Neither the pilot nor the co-pilot of the twin-engine Beechcraft turboprop was injured in Thursday night's incident at the <ORGANIZATION> Hancock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airport </ORGANIZATION>, said airline spokesman <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Mason </PERSON>. No passengers were aboard the 19-seat plane, which was bound for its home base in <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>. As the plane went down the runway, one deer hit the plane's propeller and a second hit the nose of the plane, <PERSON> Mason </PERSON> said `` The deer just came so quickly and they -LRB- bounded -RRB- out of nowhere,'' he said. The impact disabled the plane, which slid along its nose for `` some distance'' before coming to a stop, <PERSON> Mason </PERSON> said. Damage to the landing gear, propellers and front end was `` substantial,'' he said, adding that the plane was undergoing repairs Friday. <PERSON> Mason </PERSON> said a deer was killed in a similar fashion a few years ago.

The message includes the phrase `` Stand by for emergency information.'' <PERSON> Gough </PERSON> said the announcement was interrupted when the mistake was discovered, and the station resumed the movie with a superimposed message that the bulletin was broadcast in error. He said he did not know how many people called the station. `` We got calls from people right after it happened. They wanted to know for sure that it was n't for real,'' he said.

 The archbishop of <ORGANIZATION> Canterbury </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Runcie </PERSON>, on Friday announced his his support of Roman Catholic calls for Christians to boycott a new American film about <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> <PERSON> Christ </PERSON>. But a conservative <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> newspaper praised a ruling by a senior government law officer that the film, `` The Last Temptation of Christ,'' does not violate <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s blasphemy law. `` Christians have been under attack for almost 2,000 years,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telegraph </ORGANIZATION> said in an editorial Friday. `` It is not emphatically a faith so shallow as to be put at risk by the frivolity of <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION>.'' The film, which has raised angry protests in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, and other places, includes a scene in which <PERSON> Christ </PERSON> hallucinates about marrying prostitute <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Magdalene </PERSON>. The movie by <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Scorsese </PERSON> has been playing to packed theaters in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. It is due to be screened in British movie theaters starting Sept. 9. <PERSON> Runcie </PERSON>, the spiritual head of the <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> England </ORGANIZATION> and 70 million Anglicans worldwide, said Friday that parts of the movie cause `` great offense and distress.'' He said there were `` sensible arguments for wishing the film was n't shown in this country.'' Asked about a call last month by Cardinal <PERSON> Basil </PERSON> <PERSON> Hume </PERSON>, the eader of 5.2 million Catholics in <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Wales </LOCATION>, for Christians to avoid the movie, <PERSON> Runcie </PERSON> said: `` I think that is a reasonable position, and I would support him.'' <PERSON> Runcie </PERSON> spoke at <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Heathrow </LOCATION> airport on his return with his wife <PERSON> Rosalind </PERSON> from a vacation in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. He told reporters he had not seen the film while in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> but said, `` I have been reading the newspapers sometimes on holiday, and obviously there is much debate about it. `` I do n't think that I shall see it -LRB- in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> -RRB- ... It's not something that I want to see on the basis of what I've read and heard about it.'' A senior government official, Director of Public Prosecutions <PERSON> Allan </PERSON> <PERSON> Green </PERSON>, ruled Thursday that the movie does not violate <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s blasphemy law. Activists opposed to the movie have said they will continue trying to get it banned in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Whitehouse </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Viewers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Listeners </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, has said she would try to persuade local authorities to block screening of the movie.

 A sobbing mother warned <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> marshals Friday not to harm her son, who remained a fugitive three days after a federal court ordered him returned to jail on hostage-taking charges. <PERSON> Eddie </PERSON> <PERSON> Hatcher </PERSON>, 30, an American Indian, is accused with <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON>, 20, of taking up to 20 people hostage Feb. 1 at the offices of The Robesonian newspaper in <LOCATION> Lumberton </LOCATION>, in what they said was a protest of alleged corruption and discrimination against minorities by <LOCATION> Robeson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> law enforcement officials. The siege ended after 10 hours when Gov. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> agreed to form a state task force to investigate their allegations. <PERSON> Hatcher </PERSON> failed to surrender at the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Marshal's office in <LOCATION> Raleigh </LOCATION> when his bond was revoked Wednesday, and a federal arrest warrant was issued Thursday, said Chief Deputy <PERSON> Dwight </PERSON> <PERSON> Rich </PERSON>. <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON> surrendered Wednesday. `` If anything happens to my son, I will hold the federal government responsible,'' <PERSON> Hatcher </PERSON>'s mother, <PERSON> Thelma </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON>, said at a news conference outside a hospital where she underwent back surgery this week. Mrs. <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> said her son had followed the terms of his $ 100,000 bond before it was revoked. `` He kept all the rules they gave him,'' she said. `` He is not a criminal.'' <PERSON> Hatcher </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON> spent five months in jail before a three-judge panel of the 4th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> ruled in June they had not been given a bond hearing soon enough after their arrest. <PERSON> Hatcher </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON> were denied bond twice by a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> magistrate and once by a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> judge. They were ordered back into custody when the entire appeals court agreed to reconsider the case at the request of Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON>, who challenged the terms of their release. A lawyer representing <PERSON> Hatcher </PERSON> said Friday he has asked to have the federal warrant revoked because it was issued without a hearing and prosecutors had not demonstrated that <PERSON> Hatcher </PERSON> posed a danger to the community while free on bond. `` He lived where he was supposed to, honored his curfew and travel restrictions, reported religiously to the probation office -LRB- and -RRB- submitted to urinalysis,'' attorney <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Nakell </PERSON> said at a news conference in <LOCATION> Carrboro </LOCATION>, near <LOCATION> Chapel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Nakell </PERSON> refused to comment on whether he had spoken with <PERSON> Hatcher </PERSON> since the arrest warrant was issued or knew of his whereabouts.

<HEAD>Oral Roberts University Trims Medical Missionary Funds</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TULSA, Okla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Oral <ORGANIZATION> Roberts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> has reduced scholarship funds available to medical students and eliminated salaries for graduates who serve as medical missionaries for the university. The move is the latest modification in the medical missionary program that was the object of evangelist Oral <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON>' widely publicized 1987 fund-raising effort, in which he claimed he might die if donors did n't come forward. Under the revised scholarship program, first-year medical students are no longer eligible for scholarship aid offered to those who plan to become missionaries. Other medical students who sign contracts promising to work as missionaries are to receive up to $ 20,000 in scholarship aid while they are in school, university officials said Thursday. Previously, participants were eligible for up to $ 24,000. In addition, the students will no longer be eligible for $ 22,000 salaries after graduation, when they do the missionary work. In January 1987, donations to the medical missionary scholarship program were falling when <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> issued a nationwide plea for $ 8 million. He said if he did not raise the money by April 1, 1987, God would `` call me home'' to heaven. Although Oral <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> officials announced the goal was met, <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> discontinued the scholarship program a year later amid much criticism. Three months after that, he reinstated it. Students who withdraw from the program may continue to attend Oral Roberts, said Dr. <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON>, dean of the medical school. But they have to pay back whatever has been given them in scholarship money. The medical student scholarship program was begun as a pilot project for a few students in 1985. At the end of last semester, 105 students were receiving scholarships. The school now has 168 medical students enrolled, including 46 first-year students. The first-year students are not being offered scholarships, <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> said, because officials want to get to know them during this school year to make sure they are truly called to be missionaries before offering aid.

 Four hostages and heavily armed police SWAT teams spent several tense hours Friday waiting out two holdup men, until the hostages safely made a break for it and police discovered the pair had fled. The hostages spent 3 -LCB- hours inside a closet believing the holdup men were still in the bank, then dashed from the building in a bid for freedom, police said. No one was hurt. Heavily armed officers had spent the morning assuming the four bank employees were being held hostage. After the four ran out, officers fired two rounds of tear gas into the bank, searched it and found no one inside. `` It's ironic the way it worked out,'' said Officer <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Metro </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. `` We were here to play it out until the end. We do n't feel silly.'' An all-points bulletin for two men was issued when police came out of the downtown bank branch around noon without the suspects. The four hostages _ three women and a man _ were being debriefed Friday afternoon at police headquarters. Police did not know how the two burglars were able to enter the <ORGANIZATION> Third </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> through a broken rear window without triggering an alarm. The bank employees told police one man carried a sawed-off shotgun and the other had a knife, <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> said. Police said they did not know if any money was taken. The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> tried to communicate with those inside by using a bullhorn, <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> said, but received no response. Telephone calls to the bank during the four hours went unanswered. The four employees ran from the one-story granite building and were hustled into a police mobile command unit and whisked away. <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> said the burglars apparently were already in the bank when the workers arrived about 7:30 a.m. The burglars forced them into the closet, then apparently fled after another bank worker arrived, saw something was going on and went to a nearby business and called police. `` It was a burglary, and they came in to wait for an armed robbery,'' <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> said. Meantime, the employees in the closet did not know the intruders had left and remained there until their break for freedom. About 25 police officers and <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents surrounded the building and stood atop nearby businesses. Traffic on two streets was blocked off for three blocks. The bank employees were identified as bank manager <PERSON> Lattie </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, 45; assistant manager <PERSON> Trina </PERSON> <PERSON> Chance </PERSON>, 40; loan officer <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, 27; and teller Dot Oats, 51.

Also on Friday an independent team probing allegations of human rights abuses in <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION> concluded its visit. Radio <PERSON> Soleil </PERSON> said <PERSON> Schubert </PERSON> <PERSON> Baptiste </PERSON>, 30, a messenger employed by <ORGANIZATION> Televison </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nationale </ORGANIZATION>, was beaten to death during his detention at the <ORGANIZATION> Dessalines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Barracks </ORGANIZATION>. That is the headquarters of <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION>'s most feared army unit. Radio <PERSON> Soleil </PERSON>, a station operated by the Roman Catholic church, quoted <PERSON> Baptiste </PERSON>'s wife as saying <PERSON> Baptiste </PERSON> was arrested Aug. 20 for failing to repay a $ 1,000 debt to an army officer that the report identified only as Lt. <PERSON> Metellus </PERSON>.

The group also gathered information on the slaying of human rights activist <PERSON> Lafontant </PERSON> <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> who was found stabbed to death in his car on July 11. <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION> has been under the military rule of Lt. Gen. <PERSON> Henri </PERSON> <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON> since June 19 after he ousted civilian President <PERSON> Leslie </PERSON> <PERSON> Manigat </PERSON>. `` We were disappointed not to have met with Lt.

The delegation visited several other towns `` to gather information on human rights violations in those regions,'' according to an <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION> communique that said the group met with several ministers of <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON>'s all-military cabinet. Members of the team arrived Sunday night and are to report to the next session of the <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> on Nov. 14. It was the first mission by an <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION> team to <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION> since January 1987, when <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON> led a provisional government set up after President <PERSON> Jean-Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Duvalier </PERSON> fled to <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> on Feb. 7, 1986, ending a 29-year family dictatorship. <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON> relinquished power on the second anniversary of <PERSON> Duvalier </PERSON>'s flight, but returned in a bloodless coup that ousted <PERSON> Manigat </PERSON>. More than a dozen <PERSON> Manigat </PERSON> followers were held for several weeks without charges. A day after seizing power, <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON> declared himself president and abolished the legislature. A month later he suspended the constitution, which 99 percent of Haitian voters approved in a March 1987 referendum.

<TEXT>
 Critics accused President <PERSON> Augusto </PERSON> <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> on Friday of lifting the exile ban only to gain votes, but whatever the motive, many Chilean artists and performers will be able to work in their own country. Gen. <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>, who seeks to win eight more years in office as the sole candidate in a presidential referendum Oct. 5, announced Thursday that all 430 remaining political exiles may come home. One daughter of the late President <PERSON> Salvador </PERSON> <PERSON> Allende </PERSON>, overthrown in the coup led by <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> in September 1973, already has returned and <PERSON> Allende </PERSON>'s widow and other daughter have said they will come back. Among other people affected is <PERSON> Miguel </PERSON> <PERSON> Littin </PERSON>, an acclaimed movie maker whose `` Acts of Marusia'' was nominated for an Academy Award as the best foreign film of 1985. <PERSON> Littin </PERSON> and thousands of other Chileans went into exile soon after the coup. It will not be <PERSON> Littin </PERSON>'s first return. He spent several weeks here in 1986 shooting scenes for a documentary on <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION>, but he was disguised, used an assumed name and posed as a member of an Italian television crew. That film, `` General Act of <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION>,'' is critical of the Pinochet militry regime and has been shown at several European movie festivals. An account of the secret visit was written later by Colombian author <PERSON> Gabriel </PERSON> <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> <PERSON> Marquez </PERSON>, a Nobel laureate and close friend of <LOCATION> Littin </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> <PERSON> Marquez </PERSON> wrote that <PERSON> Littin </PERSON> visited several Chilean cities and on one occasion stood only a few yards from <LOCATION> Pinochet </LOCATION> while filming a ceremony. On Friday, the <LOCATION> Santiago </LOCATION> newspaper <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Epoca </ORGANIZATION> quoted <PERSON> Littin </PERSON> as saying by telephone from his home in <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION> that he would return to <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION> `` in the next few hours, or in a week.'' <PERSON> Littin </PERSON> now is shooting `` <PERSON> Sandino </PERSON>,'' a film about the late Nicaraguan revolutionary leader <PERSON> Cesar </PERSON> <PERSON> Augusto </PERSON> <PERSON> Sandino </PERSON> with <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> actor <PERSON> Dustin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoffman </PERSON> playing the role of <PERSON> Sandino </PERSON>. Also expected to return is <PERSON> Helvio </PERSON> <PERSON> Soto </PERSON>, a movie maker who has had been working in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>. Two folk groups noted for protest songs, <PERSON> Inti </PERSON> <PERSON> Illimani </PERSON> and <PERSON> Quilapallun </PERSON>, have performed successfully in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> for years. <PERSON> Inti </PERSON> <PERSON> Illimani </PERSON>, now based in <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>, was on a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> tour when <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> made his announcement. <LOCATION> Quilapallun </LOCATION> is based in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>. It was not known if either group planned to return. <PERSON> Patricio </PERSON> <PERSON> Manns </PERSON>, a folk musician who lives in <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>, also can come back. In 1986 he became an `` international spokesman'' for the <ORGANIZATION> Manuel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rodriguez </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Patriotic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION>'s main leftist guerrilla group. <PERSON> Manns </PERSON> announced in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> that the guerrillas claimed responsability for the Sept. 6, 1986, attempt to assasinate <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>, the army commander. The president escaped harm in the ambush of his motorcade on a road in the Andes foothills near <LOCATION> Santiago </LOCATION> but six bodyguards were killed and 11 wounded. <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Epoca </ORGANIZATION> quoted <PERSON> Manns </PERSON>, also a poet and author, as saying he had not decided whether to return and wanted `` security guarantees'' from the government. The Chilean <ORGANIZATION> Journalists </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> said 32 journalists are among the exiles affected. They include <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Miguel </PERSON> <PERSON> Varas </PERSON>, a communist who lives in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> and broadcasts a daily radio program, `` The Voice of <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION>.''

 Relatives of Americans who died in the Soviet downing of a Korean airliner on Friday called for a full congressional investigation into unanswered questions still surrounding the 1983 tragedy. `` It would be a dangerous precedent to let this matter fade into oblivion,'' said <PERSON> Nan </PERSON> <PERSON> Oldham </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Bethesda </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, co-chair of a family members' organization, at a news conference marking the fifth anniversary of the air disaster. The Sept. 1, 1983, downing of <ORGANIZATION> Korean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> Flight 007 claimed the lives of all 269 people aboard, including 63 Americans. The Korean jet, which had strayed more than 350 miles off course, was shot down after passing over Soviet territory while on a flight from <LOCATION> Anchorage </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, to <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. Mrs. <PERSON> Oldham </PERSON>, who lost her 27-year-old son, <PERSON> John </PERSON>, told reporters: `` We feel betrayed by our government whose silence in this case, rationalized by the questionable claim of national security concerns, is beginning to resemble a deliberate cover-up.'' `` It is fitting, indeed imperative, for <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to conduct a full-scale investigation,'' she said. `` Armed with its subpoena power and the right to examine more than 1,200 still-classified documents, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> can uncover the truth.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Oldham </PERSON> cited a March 9 letter from Sens. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kerry </PERSON>, both D-Mass., to Sen. <PERSON> Wendell </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ford </PERSON>, D-Ky., requesting an investigation by <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>'s Commerce subcommittee on The letter was subsequently referred to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. The Soviets officially have said they shot the plane down because they believed it was a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> reconnaissance aircraft violating Soviet airspace. In their letter, <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kerry </PERSON> pointed to a number of unresolved matters involving the Korean airliner affair. _ `` It is our understanding that there is evidence showing that an hour and a half into the flight, the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- controller in <LOCATION> Anchorage </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, knew that <ORGANIZATION> KAL </ORGANIZATION> 007 was off course and heading for Soviet airspace, that he considered warning the aircraft but refrained from doing so.'' _ `` There is also reason to believe that important evidence has been tampered with, that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> records were destroyed and that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Japanese tapes of communications with the airliner were falsified.'' _ `` In addition, it is our understanding that there are two contradictory sets of radar tracks, both attributed to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> radars ... showing KAL 007's course. One of them must be false,'' <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kerry </PERSON> wrote in the letter. <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> <PERSON> Piermarini </PERSON>, a staff member of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said she had no comment on prospects for an investigation by the panel. Earlier Friday, about 100 family members attended an interfaith memorial service at the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cathedral </LOCATION>, which included a reading of the names of all 269 victims, who came from 17 different countries. Among those giving brief eulogies at the service was <PERSON> Lois </PERSON> <PERSON> Bowden </PERSON> of AuGres, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>, who lost her mother, <PERSON> Eleanor </PERSON> <PERSON> Bissell </PERSON>. `` Five years have passed and I have not come to terms with her death,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Bowden </PERSON> said. She added that `` I will not be able to close the book of her life'' until the questions surrounding the tragedy have been resolved. <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Draughn </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Charles </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> La. </LOCATION>, called the loss of her 20-year-old daughter, <PERSON> Sarah </PERSON>, `` a tragedy so powerful that it would change the course of my life.'' `` We can not end -LRB- grieving -RRB- until we have used this tragedy to make a better and safer world,'' she said. <PERSON> Julia </PERSON> <PERSON> Lombard </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Hatboro </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, a <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> suburb, fought to hold back tears as she recalled the loss of her husband, <PERSON> Aiden </PERSON>, and her brother-in-law, <PERSON> Donald </PERSON>. `` How can we explain to our kids what we do n't even know ourselves?'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Lombard </PERSON>, who has four children. Another family member, Canadian <PERSON> Philippe </PERSON> <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Massy </PERSON>, said, `` It may be that we will never know everything that happened.'' <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Massy </PERSON>, who lost his younger brother, <PERSON> Francois </PERSON>, said the tragedy had brought home to him the need for `` a new ethical order in the relationships between people.''

 U.S.-backed Angolan rebels said Friday they shot down a Soviet-built MiG-23 fighter jet, killing its Cuban pilot, and killed 65 government soldiers, losing five of their own men. In neighboring <LOCATION> South-West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, the military said Friday eight pro-independence rebels were killed on the first day of a voluntary cease-fire in the South Africa-controlled territory. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> claims the rebels have no intention of observing the truce. U.S.-supported rebels of the Union for the Total Independence of <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>, known as <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION>, said in reports in <LOCATION> Lisbon </LOCATION> that its anti-aircraft units shot down the plane down Thursday. They said the airplane was bombing guerrilla positions in the central <LOCATION> Bie </LOCATION> province. <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION>, with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> African </LOCATION> support, has been fighting the Marxist government since independence from <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION> in 1975 under the leadership of <PERSON> Jonas </PERSON> <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON>. It has not been party to U.S.-sponsored talks that brought <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> together for negotiations. The rebels have continued fighting despite a cease-fire signed Aug. 22 by the three countries and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s withdrawal of its troops to neighboring <LOCATION> South-West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. Rebels fighting South African soldiers in <LOCATION> South-West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, or <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>, also had played no part in the peace talks but said they would begin a voluntary cease-fire Thursday. The eight guerrillas were killed that day in a skirmish at <LOCATION> Okankolo </LOCATION>, a settlement in the north-central part of the territory, the military said. It gave no report on its own casualties. Military spokesmen said the guerrillas were in a group of 30 that entered <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> on Aug. 26 `` with the aim of continuing the organization's armed campaign and intimidation of the region.'' `` The continued hostile activities by <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> ... indicate that the organization has no serious intentions of adhering to -LRB- the cease-fire -RRB-,'' a statement said. Also Thursday, a bomb at a <LOCATION> Windhoek </LOCATION> Hotel killed two people and injured 15. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s chief representative in the territory, <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Pienaar </PERSON>, blamed the blast on <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> South-West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>.

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Amin </PERSON> <PERSON> Gemayel </PERSON> blocked a move Friday to reinstate a Moslem-led Cabinet in an action that could enable him to put a Maronite Christian in charge. Immediately after the announcement by the presidential office Christian and Moslem militiamen clashed with machine guns, rocket-propelled grenades and 106-mm recoilless cannons across <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>'s dividing Green Line, police said. There was no immediate report of casualties. <PERSON> Gemayel </PERSON> rejected the move earlier in the day by Acting Prime Minister <PERSON> Salim </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoss </PERSON> to withdrew his Cabinet's resignation. <PERSON> Hoss </PERSON> said he was withdrawing the resignation to avert a power vacuum if <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> fails to elect a new president in the next three weeks. `` We inform you that we have withdrawn the Cabinet's resignation, which had been announced by the late Premier <PERSON> Rashid </PERSON> <PERSON> Karami </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Hoss </PERSON>, a Sunni Moslem, said in a letter to the Christian president <PERSON> Karami </PERSON>, also a Sunni, was killed in a helicopter bomb explosion June 1, 1987, 28 days after he announced the resignation of his half-Moslem, half-Christian Cabinet. After <PERSON> Karami </PERSON>'s assassination <PERSON> Gemayel </PERSON> named <PERSON> Hoss </PERSON> acting prime minister of the caretaker <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION>. The presidential palace issued a communique Friday rejecting <PERSON> Hoss </PERSON>' move. The move would leave <PERSON> Gemayel </PERSON> free to name a new interim Cabinet led by a Christian if no new president is in place before his term ends later this month. The developments came during a crisis between pro-Syrian leftists, Moslem factions and right-wing Christians over the election of a new president. When the <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> initially announced its resignation it accused <PERSON> Gemayel </PERSON> of leaning too much toward <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. Parliament failed Aug. 18 to muster the needed quorum of 51 members to elect a president. Syrian-backed warlord <PERSON> Suleiman </PERSON> <PERSON> Franjieh </PERSON>, 78, was the only serious contender. <PERSON> Franjieh </PERSON>'s backers have accused the right-wing <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lebanese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> militia of forcefully preventing deputies from attending the parliamentary session. The Lebanese Forces denied the charge and said the boycotters opposed <PERSON> Franjieh </PERSON>'s candidacy. A Lebanese Forces spokesman, who spoke on condition of anonymity, has said: `` There will be no quorum as long as <PERSON> Franjieh </PERSON> remains a candidate.'' Parliament Speaker <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> <PERSON> Husseini </PERSON>, a Shiite Moslem, adjourned the Aug. 18 session without setting the date for a new meeting to elect a head of state. The independent daily paper An-Nahar said <PERSON> Gemayel </PERSON> would form an interim Cabinet headed by a <ORGANIZATION> Maronite </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> if no president was elected by Sept. 23, when his six-year term expires. <PERSON> Hoss </PERSON>' move also appeared designed to block such an attempt by <PERSON> Gemayel </PERSON>. According to an unwritten national covenant dating to <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s independence from <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> in 1943, the president should be a Christian, the prime minister a Sunni and the house speaker a Shiite Moslem `` The formation of a new Cabinet in the present critical political situation would lead to risky consequences,'' <PERSON> Hoss </PERSON> said in his letter to <PERSON> Gemayel </PERSON>. He said the formation of a <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> headed by a Maronite prime minister would derail the presidential elections. <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s Syrian-backed Moslem and leftist factions also have told <PERSON> Gemayel </PERSON> not to form a Christian-headed Cabinet. It said such a move would rekindle the 13-year-old civil war, which has claimed more than 130,000 lives. <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> is the main power broker in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. It maintains 40,000 troops in eastern and northern provinces as well as west and south <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>New Brazilian Constitution A Mixture of Nationalism And Liberalism</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Inserts 1 graf after 4th pvs: The lawmakers completed... with
no further action needed for adoption.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By SUSANA HAYWARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BRASILIA, Brazil (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Lawmakers early Friday finished work on a new constitution that replaces the authoritarian charter drawn up two decades ago by military generals. The new constitution failed to make major social or economic changes, such as land reform and curbing the role of the military, but it legalizes strikes, abolishes censorship, strengthens <ORGANIZATION> Indians </ORGANIZATION>' rights and environmental laws, and lowers the voting age. `` <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> is a new country. This constitution will protect the weak and punish those who abuse power,'' the constituent assembly's speaker <PERSON> Ulysses </PERSON> <PERSON> Guimaraes </PERSON> said The lawmakers completed the document shortly before 2 a.m. They had begun work in February 1987, two years after civilian rule returned to <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> after 23 years under the military. No further action is required for adoption of the constitution. The document has been sent to proofreaders and it will become effective Sept. 23. The 245-article constitution covers nearly every aspect of daily life: interest rates, education, health, divorce, <ORGANIZATION> Indians </ORGANIZATION>' rights, strikes and minimum wages. A first draft had reduced the military's role to basic keepers of the peace, but rumblings from the still-powerful, behind-the-scenes generals promoted the armed forces to `` defenders'' against foreign or national threats. The nationwide <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ruralist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> lobbied hard against land reform. Its leader, powerful landowner and chiropractor <PERSON> Ronaldo </PERSON> <PERSON> Caiado </PERSON>, convinced thousands of farmers and rural workers that the constitution would expropriate `` productive land.'' Bowing to pressure, legislators excluded productive land from land reform, unless it produces marijuana. In a country where farms are the size of nations and 4 percent of the 143 million people own more than half the fertile land, very little land is expected to go to <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>'s 12 million landless peasants under the constitution. President <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Sarney </PERSON>, who came to power in 1985 in an indirect electoral college election, ardently fought against a parliamentary system of government and won a five-year term in office instead of four. Brazilians have n't voted for president since 1960 and most polls showed they wanted <PERSON> Sarney </PERSON>, a provincial politician closely linked to the military, out of office this year. Brazilians will vote for a new leader in November 1989. New envirnonmental laws are aimed at protecting <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Amazon </LOCATION> rainforest, randomly burned by the landless and speculators. Indians also gained new rights, including `` exclusive'' use of their land and resources. The constitution also: _ Lowers the voting age from 18 to 16 years of age. The only other country where 16 year olds can vote is <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. _ Legalizes strikes for all workers. Before, `` essential'' sectors of the labor force were not allowed to strike. _ Nationalizes mineral mining and gives foreign companies four years to hand over control to a Brazilian resident. _ Bans new oil risk contracts. _ Abolishes censorship of films, books and television. _ Abolishes the decree law, a powerful tool used by the president to bypass <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and push through legislation. _ Gives women 120-day maternity leaves and men five-day paternity leaves. The question Brazilians now must wrestle with is how to implement the constitution in a country with rampant corruption, runaway inflation and vast economic and social inequality. In 1993, Brazilians will vote on whether they prefer a monarch, prime minister or president to run the country.

 A judge Friday sentenced four polygamist clan members to minimum prison terms, enraging prosecutors who said the penalties for a church bombing and fatal police standoff were too lenient and possibly illegal. Chief U.S. District Judge <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Jenkins </PERSON>, amid repeated criticisms of federal mandatory sentencing standards governing bombings and firearms, said he had no choice but to order prison terms of 15 years for clan ringleader <PERSON> Addam </PERSON> <PERSON> Swapp </PERSON> and five years for his mother-in-law, <PERSON> Vickie </PERSON> <PERSON> Singer </PERSON>. `` The sentence imposed is not for what you say, not for what you believe, but for what you did,'' <PERSON> Jenkins </PERSON> told <PERSON> Swapp </PERSON>, who was seriously wounded in the Jan. 28 shootout with <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents that ended one of <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>'s most bizarre church-state confrontations. A state corrections officer was killed. <PERSON> Swapp </PERSON>'s brother, <PERSON> Jonathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Swapp </PERSON>, and Mrs. Singer's son, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Singer </PERSON>, both 21, each received mandatory 10-year sentences for a pair of firearms charges and five years' probation for two other counts. Prosecutors said the maximum penalty for the four counts was 45 years. They said <PERSON> Addam </PERSON> <PERSON> Swapp </PERSON> could have been imprisoned for 75 years and Mrs. Singer for 50 years for their parts in the Jan. 16 bombing of a Mormon chapel in <LOCATION> Marion </LOCATION> and a 13-day siege of their rural stronghold by 100 officers. `` I think once again that everyone involved in this whole process continues to wonder why it ever occurred,'' <PERSON> Jenkins </PERSON> told Mrs. Singer, 45, who tearfully implored the judge to free her. <PERSON> Jenkins </PERSON> said mandatory sentencing laws imposed by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> `` illustrate a crisis of the whole sentencing process ... whether we judge without knowing anything about the case as a matter of social policy.'' The sentences and <PERSON> Jenkins </PERSON>' criticisms of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> infuriated <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Brent </PERSON> <PERSON> Ward </PERSON>. He said prosecutors planned to appeal the sentences as illegal since <PERSON> Jenkins </PERSON> simply declined to impose penalties on some counts and rendered less-than-minimum terms on others. `` I've heard stronger sentencing comments in a drunk-driving case,'' <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> said, adding he had never been involved in a case where the sentence was `` given with apologies to the defendant and criticism of the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>.'' `` There's no case I know of that more clearly shows the wisdom of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in imposing minimum sentences,'' <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> said. State murder charges in the shooting death of state Corrections Lt. <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> House </PERSON>, killed in the shootout, were expected to be filed Tuesday against an unspecified number of the 15-member clan that included nine children under age 18. <PERSON> Swapp </PERSON> said the bombing was ordered by <PERSON> God </PERSON> as a sign of the impending collapse of the <ORGANIZATION> Mormon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> and all government, and that it would trigger the return of family patriarch <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Singer </PERSON>, slain by police nine years before for resisting arrest. The clan maintained Singer was killed in a church-state conspiracy and that the family had been harassed for years by police and neighbors. `` I have to call the state of <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to repentance. If they do not repent, they will be destroyed,'' <PERSON> Addam </PERSON> <PERSON> Swapp </PERSON>, 27, said in court Friday. He and the judge discussed the Constitution, the defendant likening the bombing to the <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tea </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Jenkins </PERSON> ended the exchange by noting <PERSON> Swapp </PERSON>'s intelligence and devotion to his two wives, Mrs. Singer's daughters, and their six children. <PERSON> Jenkins </PERSON> said the case had troubled him. `` It always seemed to me that this whole episode was an unnecessary episode. If one had sought redress in appropriate, peaceful ways, there would have been a forum,'' he said. Mrs. Singer, 45, made a plea for mercy saying she did n't want to be separated from her children. The judge said he could not overlook her culpability. `` Mrs. Singer has to look within herself and recognize that these are consequences of her own doing, no one else's,'' he said. The four clan members were convicted by a federal jury in May of 20 of 23 counts following 13 days of testimony by some 67 witnesses. On the eve of his sentencing, <PERSON> Addam </PERSON> <PERSON> Swapp </PERSON> said in a telephone interview with the <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> that God would intervene. `` We're going to be delivered. We have received the promise that we are n't going to prison. To actually say that I will not go into prison, I really do n't know. I do know whatever time they give me, I'm not going to serve it,'' <PERSON> Swapp </PERSON> said.

 Solidarity leader <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> on Friday pleaded with holdout strikers to return to work at a mine where a wave of labor unrest began 18 days ago. <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s prime minister made a similar mission to a nearby mine. In <LOCATION> Szczecin </LOCATION>, 1,800 dockworkers and 600 bus depot workers offered to end their strike as soon as job security is guaranteed for the bus workers, said <ORGANIZATION> Interfactory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Strike </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> member <PERSON> Artur </PERSON> <PERSON> Balasz </PERSON>. He said strikers idled since Aug. 17 were awaiting management's response. The end of the <LOCATION> Szczecin </LOCATION> strikes would leave the July Manifesto mine in <LOCATION> Jastrzebie </LOCATION> in southwestern <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> the only facility in the country still on strike. Workers there left their jobs on Aug. 16. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> urged strikers at July Manifesto to give up their strike in exchange for a government promise to begin national talks on legalizing the trade union Solidarity. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>'s talks with strikers at the mine continued past midnight. a Polish journalist who asked not to be identified said there was progress in the negotiations and added, `` Everybody is waiting for a happy finale.'' Prime Minister <PERSON> Zbigniew </PERSON> <PERSON> Messner </PERSON> turned up unannounced at the neighboring <LOCATION> Borynia </LOCATION> coal mine to discuss workers' concerns, Polish media said. The mine, within sight of July Manifesto, went on strike from Aug. 20-24 and labor tensions have persisted there. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> began talking to strikers at the July Manifesto mine immediately after arriving in the morning with an aide and his parish priest, Rev. <PERSON> Henryk </PERSON> <PERSON> Jankowski </PERSON>, said management spokesman <PERSON> Antoni </PERSON> <PERSON> Pilny </PERSON>. He also spoke at a rally with workers in the afternoon. <PERSON> Pilny </PERSON> later said the strikers were resisting going back to work until local issues were settled. He said outstanding issues included guaranteeing strikers' job security, raising pay, improving working conditions and reinstating fired Solidarity activists. `` The two sides are still locked in debate over the guarantees of -LRB- strikers' -RRB- personal safety,'' <PERSON> Pilny </PERSON> said. He said he expected a guarantee to be issued by the police chief and prosecutor. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> received a telegram from Roman Catholic Bishop <PERSON> Jerzy </PERSON> <PERSON> Dabrowski </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> promising that the church would defend the personal and job safety of miners who ended their strikes, <PERSON> Pilny </PERSON> said. A man answering the phone in the mine management building, who demanded anonymity, said the miners initially refused <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>'s appeal to end the strike In <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION>, 700 workers gathered at the port this morning after management told about 400 involved in the strike action not to return to their jobs, <ORGANIZATION> Gdansk </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Solidarity </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Bogdan </PERSON> <PERSON> Borusewicz </PERSON> said. Management told the workers to file applications for reinstatement but most of them went back to work, the spokesman said. Strike committee leaders were negotiating with port authorities to secure formal reinstatement. No agreement had been reached, he said. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> called for an end to strikes after meeting Wednesday with Interior Minister <PERSON> Czeslaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Kiszczak </PERSON> and Alternate Politburo member <PERSON> Stanislaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Ciosek </PERSON> to discuss <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s worst labor unrest in seven years. In the meeting _ <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>'s first with with ranking officials in six years _ the government agreed to discuss legalizing the outlawed Solidarity trade union movement and other worker issues in return for an end to the strikes. The communist authorities recognized Solidarity in an agreement signed Aug. 31, 1980, but declared martial law in December 1981 to suppress the first independent union in the Soviet bloc. Solidarity was outlawed in 1982. Government spokesman <PERSON> Jerzy </PERSON> <PERSON> Urban </PERSON> praised <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>'s efforts to end the labor unrest. `` We appreciate any positive and reasonable step. The appeal to stop the strike is such a step. It should be especially valued when it comes from a participant in the strikes,'' Urban said.

 An organization for fat people rallied Friday for an end to job discrimination against the obese, saying dieting is not the answer to the problems they face in the workplace. Members of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> to </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aid </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fat </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Americans </ORGANIZATION> say most workers who are overweight have been or will be refused jobs, promotions or health insurance benefits because of their size. `` Should we follow the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institutes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION>'s obesity panel which says slim down? No. That's not the answer,'' said member <PERSON> Rosezella </PERSON> <PERSON> Canty-Letsome </PERSON>. `` Should we lobby to -LRB- make -RRB- weighty people a constitutionally protected category? Yes.'' The group is holding a convention in <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION> through Monday, and sponsored the rally attended by about 100 people. The organization, founded in 1969 and based in <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, says it is a human rights organization dedicated to improving the quality of life for fat people. `` You're not at a fat people's rally. You're at a civil rights rally,'' said <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, co-chairman of the group's activism committee. <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Gossett </PERSON>, author of `` Fat Chance,'' a book on discrimination against overweight people, borrowed from the `` I have a dream'' speech delivered by the Rev. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Luther </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> 25 years ago. `` We have a similar dream, for people to be judged by their ability and not by their attraction to gravity,'' he said. Comparing prejudice against overweight Americans to discrimination against blacks, <PERSON> Gossett </PERSON> said, `` Today, fat people are assumed to be inherently ugly, unsanitary, stupid, lazy and enslaved by creature comforts.'' The group's president, <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Summer </PERSON>, said surveys show that 85 percent of women weighing about 200 pounds or more reported employment discrimination because of their size. A high percentage of fat women who have jobs told researchers they feel they are overqualified for the tasks they are assigned, she said. Obese workers are frequently hidden in back offices and given work that keeps them away from the public, and many are told they can not be hired because fat people take too much sick leave and drive up insurance rates, Ms. <PERSON> Canty-Letsome </PERSON> said.

 A federal judge Friday reimposed potentially bankrupting fines against <LOCATION> Yonkers </LOCATION> for defying a court-ordered housing desegregation plan, then unsuccessfully tried to reach a settlement in informal discussions. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> <PERSON> Sand </PERSON>, who found the city guilty of racially segregating housing for 40 years, reinstated the fines which were upheld by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday night. Sand said the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> decision `` does not alleviate in any way, indeed one might agree it intensifies, the fiscal crisis that confronts the city of <LOCATION> Yonkers </LOCATION>.'' He added that although the nation's highest court blocked fines and jail terms for four defiant city councilmen `` they -LRB- the councilmen -RRB- still have a responsibility to the citizens they represent who will bear the brunt of these fines.'' Because Monday, Labor Day, is a court holiday, Sand ordered the city to pay $ 192,000 on Tuesday. As previously promised by Sand, more than $ 85,000 of the money due will be earmarked for <LOCATION> Yonkers </LOCATION> public schools and to guarantee the payment of interest on city bonds. The balance of the $ 192,000 will go to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Treasury and is non-refundable. Sand then called on lawyers for all parties to immediately meet with him privately `` to explore informally some ideas we have for a possible solution of this crisis.'' The talks ended after about an hour. `` It was not successful,'' Mayor <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Wasicsko </PERSON> told reporters. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Sussman </PERSON>, attorney for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> for the Advancement of Colored People, said there was no progress and called it a `` hostile discussion.'' `` I have n't changed my position. I will do what I have to do,'' said <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Spallone </PERSON>, one of the councilman opposed to the desegregation plan. On Aug. 1, the council voted 4-3 against incentives to build 800 units of middle-income housing throughout the city as part of the desegregation plan ordered by Sand. The fine had started at $ 100 on Aug. 2 and doubled daily until it was stopped after a week pending appeals. The city has paid $ 12,700 and was to resume paying at $ 12,800 on Friday until the fine reaches $ 1 million a day and stays there, growing in million-dollar jumps. Gov. <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> said he would direct the city's <ORGANIZATION> Emergency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday to begin making the substantial reductions in city spending and services that will be required by Sand's order. The control board, which assumed management of <LOCATION> Yonkers </LOCATION>' finances Aug. 9, passed a resolution the same day saying it would seek the criminal charges against the four councilmen if the fines were reinstated. The charges stem from violating the control board act _ a state law _ by jeopardizing the city's fiscal condition. <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> said last week he would initiate removal proceedings against the four councilmen if the fines were reimposed. However, <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Fryer </PERSON> said Friday that for the time being, the governor would not attempt to oust the recalcitrant councilmen. The high court's ruling was `` raising more questions about removal than already existed and there were already many questions,'' <PERSON> Fryer </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruled late Thursday night to stay a lower court ruling that upheld contempt citations against the four councilmen, who had been paying $ 500-a-day fines and would have been subject to imprisonment this weekend. The court `` has granted the stay for the four council members'' until they have had time to ask the court formally to fully review their cases, <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Toni </PERSON> <PERSON> House </PERSON> said Thursday night. `` The application so far as the city of <LOCATION> Yonkers </LOCATION> is concerned has been denied,'' she said. Even with the $ 1 million daily fine cap, <LOCATION> Yonkers </LOCATION>, the state's fourth-largest city with a population of 200,000 people just north of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, would be bankrupt by November, officials said House said the entire court considered the applications, and Justices <PERSON> Thurgood </PERSON> <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> and <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON> filed a 12-page dissent. `` As the city repeatedly points out in its application, ` <LOCATION> Yonkers </LOCATION> is relatively unique in that most of the governmental power in the city is centralized in the legislative branch.' For this reason the city IS the council,'' <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> wrote in arguing that all the stays be denied. <PERSON> Wasicsko </PERSON>, who favors complying with Sand's housing desegregation order, said the decision troubled him. `` The treasury of the city is going to be exposed and the taxpayers of the city are going to feel the burden,'' he said. `` One thing it denies is the political martyrdom of the councilmen. They were slated to go to jail on Sunday. Their personal fines have ceased. But the city is going to plummet to bankruptcy. So their onus is their duty to the city.'' Two of the four, <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Longo </PERSON> and Vice Mayor <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Spallone </PERSON>, called the decision a `` great victory.'' But Councilman <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Chema </PERSON>, another of the four, called the decision `` a big personal victory, but I have serious concerns about the city.'' `` It's kind of like being administered oxygen while someone strangles you,'' said <PERSON> Chema </PERSON>. `` The relief becomes moot if he decides to bankrupt the city in the interim,'' <PERSON> Longo </PERSON> said. The fourth councilman, <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Fagan </PERSON>, called the decision `` unexpected'' and declined to comment further.

 <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> Clyde </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> on Friday finished his three-year assignment here during which he was accused of meddling in <LOCATION> Paragay </LOCATION>'s internal affairs and was once tear-gassed at a garden party. Before boarding the plane, <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> acknowleged having contacts with people and organizations Gen. <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON>'s government considers subversive, but added: `` We never aligned ourselves with any group.'' He said the goal of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy is `` that <LOCATION> Paraguay </LOCATION> continue being a stable country. ... Thinking of the future, five or 20 years after <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON>, is to think of a transition with someone who knows how to promote development and democracy and justice, without violence.'' <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON>, 75, seized power in 1954 and has ruled this landlocked <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> nation since with the support of the army and the <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> party. <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>'s replacement, <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Towell </PERSON>, is to arrive next week in <LOCATION> Asuncion </LOCATION>. The departing ambassador told foreign reporters: `` When I got here, it was taboo to talk of anyone replacing the president. Now, everything has changed. President <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON>, like all of us, is a little older and I see it as a good step that he himself talks about his succession.'' Relations between <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> and the general's authoritarian government became uneasy soon after the ambassador arrived in November 1985. The 50-year-old career diplomat, whose parents were Calvinist missionaries, traveled through the country advocating human rights and meeting with opposition groups. He pressed for the reopening of <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Color </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Paraguay </LOCATION>'s biggest newspaper, which was closed in 1984 for printing articles the government considered subversive. <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> also had asked the government to track down the source of a signal that jammed broadcasts by <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nanduti </ORGANIZATION>, the country's most popular station before it was forced off the air Allegations about his conduct ranged from interfering in domestic politics to conspiracy and subversion. Interior Minister <PERSON> Sabino </PERSON> <PERSON> Montanaro </PERSON> said last year <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> was close to being declared `` persona non grata.'' Police fired tear gas at a garden party given in his honor in February 1987, but <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> continued to press for human rights and speak his mind _ including a hint in February 1988 that government officials might be involved in drug trafficking.

 Critics accused President <PERSON> Augusto </PERSON> <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> on Friday of lifting the exile ban only to gain votes, but whatever the motive, many Chilean artists and performers will be able to work in their own country. Gen. <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>, who seeks to win eight more years in office as the sole candidate in a presidential referendum Oct. 5, announced Thursday that all 430 remaining political exiles may come home. One daughter of the late President <PERSON> Salvador </PERSON> <PERSON> Allende </PERSON>, overthrown in the coup led by <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> in September 1973, already has returned and <PERSON> Allende </PERSON>'s widow and other daughter have said they will come back. Among other people affected is <PERSON> Miguel </PERSON> <PERSON> Littin </PERSON>, an acclaimed movie maker whose `` Acts of Marusia'' was nominated for an Academy Award as the best foreign film of 1985. <PERSON> Littin </PERSON> and thousands of other Chileans went into exile soon after the coup. It will not be <PERSON> Littin </PERSON>'s first return. He spent several weeks here in 1986 shooting scenes for a documentary on <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION>, but he was disguised, used an assumed name and posed as a member of an Italian television crew. That film, `` General Act of <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION>,'' is critical of the Pinochet militry regime and has been shown at several European movie festivals. An account of the secret visit was written later by Colombian author <PERSON> Gabriel </PERSON> <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> <PERSON> Marquez </PERSON>, a Nobel laureate and close friend of <LOCATION> Littin </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> <PERSON> Marquez </PERSON> wrote that <PERSON> Littin </PERSON> visited several Chilean cities and on one occasion stood only a few yards from <LOCATION> Pinochet </LOCATION> while filming a ceremony. On Friday, the <LOCATION> Santiago </LOCATION> newspaper <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Epoca </ORGANIZATION> quoted <PERSON> Littin </PERSON> as saying by telephone from his home in <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION> that he would return to <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION> `` in the next few hours, or in a week.'' <PERSON> Littin </PERSON> now is shooting `` <PERSON> Sandino </PERSON>,'' a film about the late Nicaraguan revolutionary leader <PERSON> Cesar </PERSON> <PERSON> Augusto </PERSON> <PERSON> Sandino </PERSON> with <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> actor <PERSON> Dustin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoffman </PERSON> playing the role of <PERSON> Sandino </PERSON>. Also expected to return is <PERSON> Helvio </PERSON> <PERSON> Soto </PERSON>, a movie maker who has had been working in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>. Two folk groups noted for protest songs, <PERSON> Inti </PERSON> <PERSON> Illimani </PERSON> and <PERSON> Quilapallun </PERSON>, have performed successfully in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> for years. <PERSON> Inti </PERSON> <PERSON> Illimani </PERSON>, now based in <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>, was on a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> tour when <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> made his announcement. <LOCATION> Quilapallun </LOCATION> is based in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>. It was not known if either group planned to return. <PERSON> Patricio </PERSON> <PERSON> Manns </PERSON>, a folk musician who lives in <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>, also can come back. In 1986 he became an `` international spokesman'' for the <ORGANIZATION> Manuel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rodriguez </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Patriotic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION>'s main leftist guerrilla group. <PERSON> Manns </PERSON> announced in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> that the guerrillas claimed responsability for the Sept. 6, 1986, attempt to assasinate <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>, the army commander. The president escaped harm in the ambush of his motorcade on a road in the Andes foothills near <LOCATION> Santiago </LOCATION> but six bodyguards were killed and 11 wounded. <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Epoca </ORGANIZATION> quoted <PERSON> Manns </PERSON>, also a poet and author, as saying he had not decided whether to return and wanted `` security guarantees'' from the government. The Chilean <ORGANIZATION> Journalists </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> said 32 journalists are among the exiles affected. They include <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Miguel </PERSON> <PERSON> Varas </PERSON>, a communist who lives in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> and broadcasts a daily radio program, `` The Voice of <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION>.''

 A judge Friday reversed her order that a teen-age mother who left her two sons alone in a sweltering apartment for three days, practice birth control throughout her child-bearing years, saying it was unenforceable. <ORGANIZATION> Maricopa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> Lindsay </PERSON> <PERSON> Budzyn </PERSON> had sentenced <PERSON> Debra </PERSON> <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Forster </PERSON> on May 24 to lifetime probation with the birth-control stipulation. At a hearing earlier in the week, Ms. <PERSON> Budzyn </PERSON> refused to revoke the probation even though she learned that Mrs. <PERSON> Forster </PERSON>, 18, is pregnant with her fourth child. She said Mrs. <PERSON> Forster </PERSON>'s pregnancy did n't mean that the court's orders had been ignored, since no method of birth control is foolproof. Mrs. <PERSON> Forster </PERSON> pleaded guilty in April to two counts of attempted child abuse stemming from a May 1987 incident in which she left her two sons, <PERSON> William </PERSON>, 1 -LCB-, and <PERSON> Scott </PERSON>, 6 months, alone in a <LOCATION> Mesa </LOCATION> apartment for three days. Authorities said the apartment had no air conditioning, and both babies were dehydrated and near death when found. The judge said at <PERSON> Forster </PERSON>'s sentencing that the birth control stipulation was the only way to make sure Mrs. <PERSON> Forster </PERSON> did not have other children to abuse. Ms. <PERSON> Budzyn </PERSON>'s ruling Friday came on motions filed by defense attorney <PERSON> Garrett </PERSON> <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON>, Mrs. <PERSON> Forster </PERSON>'s public defender, and attorney <PERSON> Colin </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON>, representing the <ORGANIZATION> Arizona </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, to modify the terms of probation by deleting the birth-control requirement. <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON> argued that the order was invasive, amounted to cruel and unusual punishment and violated freedom of religion for Mrs. <PERSON> Forster </PERSON>, a Roman Catholic. In her ruling Friday, Ms. <PERSON> Budzyn </PERSON> wrote the birth-control requirement was being lifted because of `` its inability to be enforced.'' Instead, the judge ordered that Mrs. <PERSON> Forster </PERSON> undergo urinalysis testing for drugs every two weeks; enroll in a comprehensive counseling program including individual counseling and classes in parenting skills, prenatal care and birth control; receive marriage counseling; and have a complete assessment of her medical condition at the time of the delivery of her child. While awaiting trial this year, Mrs. <PERSON> Forster </PERSON> gave up the rights to her sons and a daughter who was born in jail. According to court records, all three have been adopted.

 The bankruptcy trustee for the <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> religious complex said Friday he's `` very, very skeptical'' about whether founder <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> will come up with the cash to back up his $ 165 million offer for the ministry. M.C. `` Red'' <PERSON> Benton </PERSON> told The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> in a telephone interview from his <LOCATION> Winston-Salem </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, home that he thinks the former television evangelist does have a financial commitment from 28 Greek businessmen who are supposed to be backing the deal. <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> has not identified those businessmen even to <LOCATION> Benton </LOCATION>. But he said <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> seems to be having some trouble getting the cash into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Benton </PERSON> had said Thursday that he expected <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>, who founded the television ministry and theme park but then left after admitting to extramarital sex, to sign a contract to buy <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> on Friday morning. But the money was not available and legal details were not yet worked out, so <PERSON> Benton </PERSON> extended the deadline until Tuesday morning. <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> lawyer <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON> <PERSON> Hovis </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Rock </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>, who met with <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> bankruptcy lawyers Friday at <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Heritage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION> park, said there were no `` serious snags'' in the negotiations and that a $ 3 million letter of credit to back up <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>'s offer would be available by Tuesday. <PERSON> Hovis </PERSON> said the reason the contract was n't signed Friday morning as previously announced is that a lot of legal details must be taken care of for such a large purchase. <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> lawyers who met with <PERSON> Hovis </PERSON> on Friday declined comment on the negotiations. <PERSON> Benton </PERSON> said if the money is n't available by Tuesday, he'll be forced to consider other bids for the ministry's assets. He said offers of $ 120 million, $ 125 million and one ranging from $ 150 million to $ 200 million have been made, as well as <LOCATION> Canadian </LOCATION> real estate executive <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>' standing offer of $ 113 million. He declined to elaborate. <PERSON> Benton </PERSON> has a deadline of Sept. 10 to recommend a buyer to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Bankruptcy Judge <PERSON> Rufus </PERSON> <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON>. `` We ca n't present anything to the judge if we do not have full and complete assurance that he -LRB- <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> -RRB- can fulfill the commitment,'' <PERSON> Benton </PERSON> said. `` I am very, very skeptical about whether he'll come up with the money.'' <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON> has not indicated when he will choose a buyer for <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION>, but he has said during court hearings that he's anxious to pay creditors and to keep <ORGANIZATION> Heritage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION> operating. Any involved parties could appeal <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON>' choice of a buyer to <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Benton </PERSON> said his job is to secure the deal that will pay the most money to creditors, not to determine <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>'s chances of success. <PERSON> Benton </PERSON> said if <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> does come up with the cash and secures the deal, he thinks things will be different this time around. `` I think he would have a financial watchdog to keep him out of trouble,'' he said. `` I really think he's learned his lesson.'' <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> told The Charlotte -LRB- <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION> -RRB- Observer on Thursday that he's confident his new ministry _ <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Covenant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partners </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> _ will succeed `` I see it as a chance to do some of the things better where I've made mistakes and wrong decisions,'' <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> said. `` There will strict financial controls to make sure <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> lives within its budget.''

 Most alligator hunters were disappointed after the first day of <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s month-long gator season, but by Friday morning some lucky ones bagged animals as long as nine feet. Thursday at sunset marked the beginning of the first legal alligator hunt in 26 years for the lucky _ or not-so-lucky _ 230 people granted permits to catch the reptiles with harpoons, nooses, crossbows and almost anything but a gun. The first night of the 30-day hunt netted about 130 alligators in 28 designated hunting areas across the state, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Game </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fresh </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Water </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. Thirty-eight were bagged in the <LOCATION> Everglades </LOCATION>, while 36 were taken in the <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Okeechobee </LOCATION> area, a spokesman said. Two novice hunters, <PERSON> David </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Navin </PERSON>, snaked through a <LOCATION> Dade </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> canal in the darkness looking for the red-reflecting eyes that give away the swimming reptiles, but the gators refused to cooperate. `` There's a few here, but they're not really doing what they're supposed to,'' chuckled <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Navin </PERSON> `` They're a little tougher than we thought.'' His brother <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> called their experience `` on-the-job training.'' To the north on <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Okeechobee </LOCATION>, one of the designated hunting areas, some gator pursuers reported better luck. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Alpern </PERSON>, 25, of <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, the only northerner receiving a permit, bagged a nine-footer despite worrying beforehand that he might be unable to kill the animal even when he captured it. With gator hides selling for $ 42 a foot and meat running up to $ 6 a pound, <PERSON> Alpern </PERSON> and others persevered, though few expected to bag their 15-gator limit the first night. Hide and meat sales from a single alligator can total $ 300 to $ 500. `` We're having fun,'' said <PERSON> Bud </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolfe </PERSON>, an alligator hunter from <LOCATION> Oakland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>. `` Where else but in <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> can you go after a 500-pound animal that can kill you?'' Early success came to <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Donate </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> and his guide, <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Medore </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Clewiston </LOCATION>. They snagged a 8-foot-3-inch animal only 80 minutes after they started hunting on <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Okeechobee </LOCATION>. Once they got the gator reeled up to the side of the boat, they shot it with a `` bang stick,'' a firearm-like gadget that is allowed under the game commission rules. `` We blew one hell of a hole in his head,'' Donate said. `` It was exciting.'' He then taped the gator's mouth shut. `` It's scary putting that tape on his mouth, even with a hole in his head,'' he said. <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> <PERSON> Mackie </PERSON> and <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Prater </PERSON>, who work for the city of <LOCATION> Pembroke </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pines </LOCATION>' utilities department, bagged a 6-foot alligator and another that was 8 feet or longer. <PERSON> Prater </PERSON> showed how he hooked one just beside the alligator's left rear leg with a large hook on a heavy-duty saltwater fishing rod. He said fighting the gator when it was hooked was very difficult, and he snapped the heavy fiberglass rod. `` It was a deep-sea rod and it just plain snapped in two,'' he marveled. Alligator hunting was outlawed in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> in 1962 because wildlife biologists feared overhunting of the ancient reptiles might threaten the survival of the alligator. A small alligator industry has built up in recent years because alligators have increasingly become problems by turning up in urban areas and pestering and occasionally killing humans or their pets. Estimates place the current number of alligators living in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> at 1 million, and game commission officials said they are now far from an `` endangered'' species.

 A spokesman for Kurdish rebels fighting <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> government troops said Friday the <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> army slaughtered about 1,300 unarmed men, women and children this week. Kurdish refugees in a camp in <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> said they fled on foot from <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> chemical bomb attacks that killed about 500 people in their group. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, the human rights group <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> said Friday that <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> had used chemical weapons in a military campaign against Kurdish villages that has left hundreds of civilians dead. The London-based group accused <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> of a `` systematic and deliberate policy'' of killing Kurds. The reports were among many recent accusations of Iraqi atrocities against Kurds, who are fighting for an independent homeland in northern <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Iraqi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> quoted an `` official source'' as denying chemical weapons were used in northern <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. The source identified the Kurds who are fleeing into <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> as `` traitors'' who collaborated with the Iranian `` invaders'' during the eight-year <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> war. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> launched a major offensive against the rebels after accepting a U.N.-sponsored cease-fire in the war last month. Both the Turkish and Iranian governments have reported the arrival of thousands of Kurds. In <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>, Premier <PERSON> Turgut </PERSON> <PERSON> Ozal </PERSON> said Thursday that 60,000 refugees had arrived since the country opened its borders two weeks ago. The official of the <ORGANIZATION> Kurdish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> in a telephone interview that soldiers arrested the victims in the <LOCATION> Dahuk </LOCATION> region in northwestern <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, killed them, then buried them in mass graves Sunday. He also said the <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> military was holding back 43,000 people trying to flee the region. The report could not be independently confirmed. The spokesman, based in a <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> capital, has given information to the AP on several other occasions. He declined to give his name for security reasons. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s 3.5 million Kurds have been waging their separatist struggle on and off for 50 years. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> has supported the Kurdish rebels in their fight against <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. The rebels estimated Wednesday that 60,000 troops backed by fighter-bombers and helicopter gunships were fighting them. One of the refugees in <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>, 64-year-old <PERSON> Salih </PERSON> <PERSON> Zaid </PERSON>, said three bombs fell near his group them as they prepared to leave their village. `` I fainted, and when I came to I saw that my daughter and two sons were dead,'' he said. <PERSON> Zaid </PERSON> said he was partially blinded by gas with a garlic-like smell that he claimed was mustard gas. The <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> has said that <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> has in the past used mustard gas, which is distinguishable by its garlic-like smell. The refugees, most of them from <LOCATION> Zakho </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Duhok </LOCATION> townships in northern <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, said they walked north for three days to reach the Turkish border after the <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> army launched an offensive, heavily bombing their settlements in the last week of August. `` We were under constant bombardment all during our trek. About 500 people from our original group of 10,000 died before reaching the Turkish border,'' said <PERSON> Aziz </PERSON> <PERSON> Taha </PERSON>, 25, a university student who was in his hometown, <LOCATION> Duhok </LOCATION>, when the Iraqi assault started. In other reports, the Iranian government-run <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> quoted Kurdish refugees in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> as saying their villages were destroyed by <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> forces. `` My house has been set on fire three times ...,'' <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION> quoted Iraqi villager <PERSON> Hakim </PERSON> <PERSON> Refaq </PERSON>, 42, as saying. The party spokesman said fighting between the Kurdish rebels and the Iraqi army was escalating. The army used chemical weapons to attack three villages in the <LOCATION> Amadiyah </LOCATION> area Wednesday and Thursday, he said. `` We call upon the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> and the international community to intervene and stop this war of genocide against our people,'' he said. On Friday, <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Nadia </PERSON> <PERSON> Younes </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> that Secretary-General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> had received cables from Kurdish groups and that <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> officials were studying them. About 20 million Kurds live in the mountains where the borders of <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> meet. <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> also have small Kurdish enclaves.

 Lottery machines spewed out tickets by the millions Friday as players scurried for a chance to win Saturday's world-record $ 52 million Lotto jackpot. Tickets were selling at a rate of about 265 per second, said <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> George </PERSON>, spokesman for the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> lottery. For the day, 7.5 million tickets at $ 1 apiece had been sold by 5 p.m., compared to 4.9 million at the same time last Friday when the jackpot was $ 32 million. The jackpot has been climbing because no one has won since Aug. 6. Fridays are the lottery's second-biggest sales day. A full 50 percent of any week's sales are made on Saturdays through 10:30 p.m. when computerized ticket machines shut down for the 11 p.m. drawings. Last week some 32 million tickets were sold. This week, officials expected sales to hit 40 million. It took <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> only four months to break the world record for a Lotto prize, which <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> set in June with a $ 51.4 million prize that was shared by two winners. <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> launched its Lotto game in April. In spite of the 14-million-to-one odds, the record-jackpot was attracting players from bordering states in large numbers, lottery officials said. Eight of the state's top 10 retailers, measured by ticket sales, are located in <LOCATION> Panhandle </LOCATION> or northeast <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> counties bordering <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, neither of which has a legalized lottery, said <PERSON> George </PERSON>. `` We do know that our border retailers are very heavy,'' said <PERSON> George </PERSON>. `` Any one of those retailers will tell you what the tags are on the cars in the parking lots.'' The lottery's telephone hotline has been receiving calls from out-of-state residents wanting to buy tickets without coming to <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. But because <ORGANIZATION> Postal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> regulations prohibit the sale of the lottery tickets through the mail, people must visit <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> to buy their tickets or have someone buy them. `` We've got so many people running in and out of here. I had somebody call at 6 o'clock this morning wanting to know if I was open,'' said <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> McMurtray </PERSON>, manager of a convenience store and service station in <LOCATION> Bradfordville </LOCATION>, about eight miles south of the <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> border. Lotto players select six numbers from one through 49, mark their selections on a computer card, which is read by a ticket machine. The $ 51.4 million <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> prize had been the world record, according to <ORGANIZATION> Terri </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fleur </ORGANIZATION>, a senior editor at Gaming and <ORGANIZATION> Wagering </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Magazine </ORGANIZATION>, a monthly trade publication in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Valenza </PERSON>, publisher of <ORGANIZATION> Lottery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Players </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> magazine </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Moorestown </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, agreed with <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fleur </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>'s `` El Gordo'' lottery gave away $ 56 million in 1983, but it was not a Lotto-style jackpot.

 Democratic nominee <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> jibed at both men on the Republican ticket Friday, labeling <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> a dropout on education and ridiculing the idea of <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> leading the war against drugs. Speaking to an enthusiastic, flag-waving crowd, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> asked, `` Is there anybody here today, is there any citizen in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, who thinks that <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> is qualified to be the nation's drug czar?'' The crowd of 2,000 to 3,000 people in a public park erupted in hoots and cheers. Dressed in shirtsleeves on a bright, sunny day in which the temperature headed toward 100 degrees, the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor noted that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had said he was going to put his vice president in charge of the war against drugs. `` <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> tried that and it failed,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. He also stressed the schools issue, a recurring theme of his speeches during a pre-Labor Day campaign swing up the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION>. `` The future will depend, above all, on the quality of education we provide,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. He accused the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration of seeking to cut funds for remedial programs and teacher training while he had worked to bolster such programs in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>. Then he asked what <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who says he wants to be known as the `` education president,'' was doing at the time. `` I guess he just dropped out,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. In <LOCATION> Spokane </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> kept up his attack on <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, saying at a rally at a steelworkers' union hall: `` Is n't it nice to have a <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> nominee for vice president whose qualifications have never been questioned by anybody?'' The <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION> crowd, which included some anti-abortion demonstrators, was one of the most enthusiastic to greet <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> during the campaign, and he had little trouble drawing partisan responses to his punch lines. Several times the crowd picked up the chant, first heard at the Democratic convention in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, of `` Where was <PERSON> George </PERSON>?'' _ a reference to <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> claims that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> tried to dissociate himself from such controversial <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration activities as arms sales to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. The crowd also loudly booed a reference to President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s Star Wars plan for a space-based missile defense system In another cut at <LOCATION> Quayle </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said that in a Democratic administration, `` we're going to have a vice president who's been a leader in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>.'' In contrast to <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, a 41-year-old senator from <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' running mate, <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, is one of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>'s senior members. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> appeared in <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION> only hours after announcing that <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sasso </PERSON>, forced to resign a year ago as campaign manager, would return with the title of vice chairman. <PERSON> Sasso </PERSON> left the campaign on Sept. 30 because of his involvement in distribution of a videotape demonstrating that Sen. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Biden </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION>, a <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> rival for the Democratic nomination, had incorporated language by a British politician in his own speeches without giving credit. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was introduced at the rally by <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldschmidt </PERSON>, who said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> `` has set the standard for every governor in the country.'' As for the Republican nominee, <PERSON> Goldschmidt </PERSON> said, `` With <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, what you see is all that you get.'' In <LOCATION> Spokane </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> toured a <ORGANIZATION> Kaiser </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aluminium </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> plant and gave his standard `` good-jobs-at-good-wages'' stump speech at the union hall. Later, at the airport, asked again about <PERSON> Sasso </PERSON>'s return, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> replied: `` He is a very talented person. ... <PERSON> John </PERSON> did n't do anything that was illegal or dishonest. It was a mistake in judgment.''

<HEAD>Newspaper Says Nine Arrested In Zia Crash Probe</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 An air force squadron leader and eight other people were arrested in connection with the plane crash that killed President <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> <PERSON> ul-Haq </PERSON>, a published report said Friday. <PERSON> Jang </PERSON>, an Urdu-language daily, quoted `` informed sources'' as saying the nine were arrested Thursday night at <LOCATION> Islamabad </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>, which doubles as a military airbase. It did not name the suspects, identify them further, say where they were held or detail their alleged involvement in the case. It said one was an air force squadron leader. Government offices were closed Friday, the Moslem Sabbath, and officials were not available for comment. <PERSON> Zia </PERSON>'s personal C-130 transport plane took off from <LOCATION> Islamabad </LOCATION> on Aug. 17 to the southeastern city of <LOCATION> Bahawalpur </LOCATION>, where he watched a demonstration of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> M-1 <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> battle tank. The four-engine turboprop exploded after takeoff on the return flight and crashed. All 30 people aboard were killed, including <PERSON> Zia </PERSON>, <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON> <PERSON> Raphel </PERSON> and several top generals. Previous reports said more than 20 Pakistanis have been arrested in the crash investigation, which government officials said is focusing on sabotage. <PERSON> Jang </PERSON> said an airport security officer and some civilian aviation officials had also been detained but were released before the Thursday arrests. No formal charges have been filed. Pakistani newspapers have carried unsourced reports that investigators suspect the plane either had a bomb on board or was hit by an anti-aircraft missile. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> teams are assisting in the probe, but officials said no cause has been determined.

 A <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> officer's court-martial in the drowning of a rescue-swimmer recruit proved that the recruit's rights were violated, regardless of the innocent verdict, the victim's family said Friday A panel of four officers late Thursday found Lt. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Torchia </PERSON>, former officer in charge of the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rescue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Swimmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, innocent on two dereliction-of-duty charges after a seven-day trial. <PERSON> Torchia </PERSON> was in charge of the school at <ORGANIZATION> Pensacola </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Naval </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> station on March 2 when <PERSON> Airman </PERSON> <PERSON> Recruit </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Mirecki </PERSON>, 19, of <LOCATION> Appleton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wis. </LOCATION>, died in a training pool after suffering a fear-induced heart attack. Witnesses testified that instructors threw <PERSON> Mirecki </PERSON> into the pool and that one held his head under water after the panic-stricken recruit climbed out and shouted that he wanted to `` D-O-R,'' or drop on request, <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> jargon for quitting the voluntary training. `` My brother's rights to DOR were totally violated without a doubt,'' said his sister, <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON> <PERSON> Johansen </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Appleton </LOCATION>. `` The law was broken according to the Uniform Code of Military Justice. That comes out loud and clear.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Johansen </PERSON> and her husband, <PERSON> Larry </PERSON>, sat through most of the trial. <PERSON> Mirecki </PERSON>'s mother, <PERSON> Elaine </PERSON> <PERSON> Kitowski </PERSON>, of Manitowish Waters, <LOCATION> Wis. </LOCATION>, and her husband, <PERSON> Mel </PERSON> <PERSON> Kitowski </PERSON>, also attended. `` It is a very stressful thing for our family to be here,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Johansen </PERSON> said. `` The verdict is not the most important thing for us.'' Most important, she said, is finding out how her brother died. Family members declined to express an opinion on the verdict, but said they were satisfied with the prosecution of the case, led by Lt. Cmdr. <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Wynne </PERSON>. Mrs. <PERSON> Kitowski </PERSON> said she believed the court-martial panel thought the defendant's ignorance of what the instructors were doing to her son was insufficent reason `` to make him a criminal.'' <PERSON> Torchia </PERSON> testified he was on the telephone in his office overlooking the pool but neither heard nor saw anything to indicate something was wrong. If present, he said, he would have stopped the instructors. <PERSON> Torchia </PERSON>, 32, of <LOCATION> Princeton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, said he intended to continue his <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> career as an aviation maintenance officer. <PERSON> Mirecki </PERSON>'s family is staying in <LOCATION> Pensacola </LOCATION> for the court-martial of a second defendant, Petty Officer 2nd Class <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Combe </PERSON>, 28, of <LOCATION> Tempe </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ariz. </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Combe </PERSON>, an instructor, is charged with involuntary manslaughter, battery and conspiracy to commit battery charges He is accused of holding <PERSON> Mirecki </PERSON>'s head under water. A five-member panel of officers was seated Friday night to hear the case, beginning Tuesday. Also, a motion to dismiss the charges was denied by the military judge who has handled both trials. Cmdr. <PERSON> Newell </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Krogmann </PERSON> made a similar ruling in the <PERSON> Torchia </PERSON> case. Defense lawyer W.H.F. <LOCATION> Wiltshire </LOCATION> of <LOCATION> Pensacola </LOCATION> argued that Vice Adm. N.R. Thunman, chief of naval education and training, was unqualified to convene the court-martial because there was an appearance he had a personal interest in the outcome of the case. He contended <PERSON> Thunman </PERSON>'s interest stemmed from the adverse attention his command has received as a result of the death. <PERSON> Wynne </PERSON> argued against the motion, saying that extending <LOCATION> Wiltshire </LOCATION>'s theory up the chain of command would prohibit anyone, including the chief of naval operations, from convening a court-martial in such a high-visibility case. <PERSON> Thunman </PERSON> testified Wednesday that he had wanted to correct what he said were erroneous press reports that the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> failed to begin investigating the case until receiving outside pressure from the victim's family, their congressman and the media. He also was concerned about initial reports released by <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> spokesman who incorrectly said the death was from natural causes.

 President <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> appointed a new economy minister and also changed four other Cabinet posts, the government said Friday, in the struggle to combat inflation. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Statistics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> said Friday that consumer prices increased 243 percent from January through August, the biggest such rise in Peruvian history. The Cabinet shakeup was the fourth in the three-year-old <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> government. Energy Minister <PERSON> Abel </PERSON> <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> was appointed late Thursday to replace Economy Minister <PERSON> Cesar </PERSON> <PERSON> Robles </PERSON>, who resigned, according to the official gazette <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peruano </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Jorge </PERSON> <PERSON> Carrasco </PERSON>, a congressional deputy and president of the <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deputies </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, was named to head the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>, according to the report. Late Friday, <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> named Justice Minister <PERSON> Camilo </PERSON> <PERSON> Carrillo </PERSON> to head the <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>, replacing <PERSON> Francisco </PERSON> <PERSON> Maury </PERSON>, who resigned, and Sen. <PERSON> Cesar </PERSON> <PERSON> Delgado </PERSON> was named justice minister. <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON> <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON>, president of the state steel company <LOCATION> Sider </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>, was appointed to replace industry minister <PERSON> Guillermo </PERSON> <PERSON> Arteaga </PERSON> who left the <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON>, head of the center-left <ORGANIZATION> Aprista </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, said other posts in the 15-member Cabinet would not be changed. The five ministers were sworn in to their posts late Friday, according to the government. <PERSON> Robles </PERSON> was the third economy minister in <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON>'s government and served only three months. Manufacturing has continued to decline and shortages of basic consumer goods are widespread. The 39.9 percent cost of living increase in July was the highest one-month total in Peruvian history. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Statistics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> said in a statement published in Friday's gazette that prices increased 21.7 percent in August over July and the total for the year so far was 243 percent. Government officials have said inflation may reach 400 percent for all of 1988 but independent analysts predict at least 500 percent. The previous high was 158.3 percent in 1985 and the inflation rate for 1987 was 114.5 percent. Analysts said <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> is expected to introduce new austerity measures.

 Unemployment climbed to 5.6 percent in August as the number of jobless Americans grew by 226,000 and a four-month hiring boom in the nation's factories ended abruptly, the government said Friday. Stock and bond prices soared on the news, and analysts said the softening job market was just the `` cold shower'' than an overheating economy needed. They predicted it will keep a lid on inflation and interest rates through the November elections. The 0.2 percentage point rise from July's unemployment rate of 5.4 percent was characterized by 5,000 layoffs in a manufacturing sector that had put 130,000 more workers on their assembly lines in the previous three months in response to surging foreign demand for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> exports.

 What's in a name, you ask? At the <ORGANIZATION> Edinburgh </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Festival </ORGANIZATION>, a lot. With 913 shows on the unofficial Festival Fringe competing for theatergoers' time and money, participants found it's the name of the event, not necessarily the work itself, that often is the thing. `` If it's an unknown play, the name can make people look twice,'' playwright <PERSON> Eleanor </PERSON> <PERSON> Zeal </PERSON> said of her show `` The Tainted Honey of Homicidal Bees,'' just one of numerous Fringe offerings whose title immediately catches the eye. Indeed, visitors to the 42nd Festival Fringe, which ended on Sept. 3, and which played alongside the Scottish capital's higher-profile mainstream cultural binge, are besieged by any number of suggestive, pun-filled or just plain odd titles chosen to make one event stand out from the next This year's entries ranged from take-offs on popular movies: There's both a `` Futile Attraction'' and a `` Fatal Distraction,'' based on the box-office hit `` Fatal Attraction,'' as well as a `` <ORGANIZATION> Jean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> de </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Toilette </ORGANIZATION>,'' based on the critically acclaimed `` Jean de Florette.'' There also are Shakespearean send-ups such as `` Not Much of Ado'' and `` Jesus Christ! It's <PERSON> Julius </PERSON> <PERSON> Caesar </PERSON>.'' Any title is permissible on the Fringe as long as it's not libelous. <PERSON> Trisha </PERSON> <PERSON> Emblem </PERSON>, the Fringe assistant administrator, defined a good title as one that's `` memorable, even if it's nothing witty.'' She cited `` The Life and <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hieronymus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bosch </ORGANIZATION>'' as a title that was effective because of its distinctiveness. Sometimes, people do n't realize how distinctive their title is. `` We did n't actually choose it to cause a stir,'' said <PERSON> Carolyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Davies </PERSON>, co-director of `` Straight Laced, <PERSON> Jo </PERSON> <PERSON> Orto </PERSON> n't, <PERSON> Jo </PERSON> Should n't, <PERSON> Jo </PERSON> Would n't, <PERSON> Jo </PERSON> Could n't, <PERSON> Jo </PERSON> Did n't,'' a satirical comedy that had this year's longest name. `` We all sat around and thought, ` OK, what are we going to call it?' And suddenly, it arrived,'' <PERSON> Davies </PERSON> recalled, aware that length has its disadvantages. `` We could n't fit the name on the tickets,'' she said, `` but it's on all the posters and leaflets.'' One playwright was worried his title was too distinctive. `` I have a feeling a lot of people are going to say it's strident,'' <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> <PERSON> Harries </PERSON> said of the title to his show `` Hold Your Horses, <PERSON> Mussolini </PERSON>,'' a comedy with music and dancing about one King Zog of <LOCATION> Albania </LOCATION> But <PERSON> Harries </PERSON>, a 36 year-old marketing director who last wrote a Fringe play 10 years ago, stood by his choice: `` It's honest; it really does say what you need to know about the play. It's immediately arresting and surprising. And what if the title's good but the play itself is n't? All agreed that there's the rub. `` There has to be something behind a title, an interesting concept in the play itself,'' said <PERSON> Trisha </PERSON> <PERSON> Emblem </PERSON>. Speaking by telephone from his office in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> <PERSON> Harries </PERSON> said, `` I shall be there -LRB- in <LOCATION> Edinburgh </LOCATION> -RRB- every day ... talking to people to find out why they came to see my show.''

 Having made films about political violence on three continents, Greek-born filmmaker <PERSON> Costa-Gavras </PERSON> now turns his attention to racial terrorism in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The movie is `` Betrayed,'' in which Debra Winger portrays an undercover <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agent who becomes the lover of <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Berenger </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> farmer who leads a paramilitary white supremacy sect. The story begins with the murder of a controversial radio talk-show host and includes the robbing of banks to finance the movement. Once again a Costa-Gavras film has paralleled news events. His most famous films portrayed <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> involvement in the overthrow of <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION>'s military regime -LRB- `` Missing'' -RRB-, and military despotism in <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> -LRB- `` Z'' -RRB-. He has also dealt with torture in <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> in `` State of Siege,'' <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> Stalinism in `` The Confession'' and the Palestinian issue in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> with `` <PERSON> Hanna </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON><PERSON> '' </PERSON> <PERSON> Costa-Gavras </PERSON>, who has lived in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> for many years, is no stranger to controversy. He recently talked with accustomed frankness about his work and politics during a visit to <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> for the <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> opening of `` Betrayed.'' Q. Is there something unique about racism in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>? A. Here it's different. The expression of racism is probably much more violent. The ideology of racism is the same everywhere, unfortunately. Q. Did you do a lot of research for `` Betrayed''? A. Yes. The moment I started to do the movie, which means three years ago, I started doing research in the different fields. You find everything in television or in books or in newspaper interviews. It's extraordinary; everything is there. I saw hours of tapes. A lot of things happened during and after my research. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Beach </PERSON> happened while I was researching. Then the <PERSON> Bernhard </PERSON> <PERSON> Goetz </PERSON> story. All those things are extraordinary. I think the last 10-15 years is a kind of wave of racism. -LRB- Costa-Gavras was referring to a Dec. 20, 1986, incident in the <LOCATION> Howard </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> section of <LOCATION> Queens </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, in which a group of young whites beat and chased some blacks, resulting in the death of one black. <PERSON> Goetz </PERSON>, who is white, was convicted in June 1987 of a weapons violation in the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> subway shooting of four black youths he said he thought were going to rob him. -RRB- Q. Do you think racism has become more prevalent than before? A. Yes, I think so. I do not know the reasons. I try to understand why. I think it always was there, somehow. But people feel authorized to express themselves much more openly. Q. The most shocking scene in `` Betrayed'' is when the farmers, armed with automatic guns, stage a kind of nighttime foxhunt of a young black. Do you think that could happen in this country? A. No, I do n't have any direct evidence that it happened. What I'm trying to do there is make the scene as strong as possible, just to show how unbearable, how frightening can be racist murder. ... I do n't see much difference between killing a man on the street because he is black or has a different religion, or hunting him. I tried to dramatize how unacceptable that can be. Q. Why did you choose Debra Winger? <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Debra </PERSON> has the quality of being a strong person as a character and an excellent actress. She also has a very personal involvement in what is going on in the world. Those three elements are essential for someone to play that kind of role. Q. And <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Berenger </PERSON>? A. I like <PERSON> Tom </PERSON>'s cowboy style _ handsome and clean, he has that kind of face. And then it's like the moon: He has a dark side. All of us have our dark side. The important thing is how far we go with our dark side. Q. As an outsider, do you think you have a better view of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>? A. Maybe not better. Different, surely, because I have so much curiosity about your society. Everything that happens here has a direct effect on where we are coming from, the smaller countries of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, socially and artistically. We have a curiosity and also a tenderness about your country, because you have given us some many things: movies, theater, literature, music. These things we grew up on. Q. Your films always seem to have political overtones. Is this because of your particular psyche? A. I prefer to say `` ethical,'' a more hopeful view. But if we say `` political,'' I think all movies contain political meaning.... Every movie reflects the philosophy or the ethics of its authors Mine are no exception. Q. Do you deplore that outpouring of mindless violence and silly comedies that pour forth from the studios, especially in the summertime? A. Oh yes, yes. ... Let's take an example: the last `` Rambo.'' Everybody says, `` Let's be peaceful, let's try to understand each other, East-West.'' Then you have something that exploits passion and hate and all those things. But on the contrary, there is in the summertime some extraordinary qualities -LRB- in films -RRB-. I like very much the light movies. I like to go and have fun; it's very pleasant.

 The infant gingerly reaches for <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Belling </PERSON>'s mustache Their eyes meet and a big baby grin spreads across the 2-month-old's face. The boy's teen-age parents, homeless and drug addicted, are n't there to capture the moment But <PERSON> Belling </PERSON> is. He is one of a growing number of 60-minute dads and moms. They give their time and love to help cuddle and care for the city's small army of boarder babies _ infants forced to live in sterile hospital settings Looking around the crowded nursery at <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Luke </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Belling </PERSON>, an unmarried box-office clerk, prefers to dwell on the positive: `` What I've done is given a tiny baby some nourishment, some comfort, even if it is only for an hour.'' The babies wind up in hospitals for various reasons. Some have been abandoned or have parents who ca n't afford to take care of them. Most have parents who `` are n't fit to take care of them,'' usually addicts, says <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> <PERSON> Ormsby </PERSON> of the city's <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, which oversees the boarder baby program. There are about 300 such infants in the city, most of them black or Hispanic; children who, at one point, spent as much as three months lying in steel-sided cribs and plastic bassinets, waiting to be put in foster homes. Reforms in the system have since helped reduce that wait to an average of five days for healthy infants. But those with special needs can stay as long as eight months, says <PERSON> Carolyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Yordan </PERSON>, of the <ORGANIZATION> Greater </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, which represents 70 hospitals. Boarder babies are fed and changed at regular intervals by already overburdened staff nurses. But what about love? That's where people like <PERSON> Belling </PERSON> come in. They're part of <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Luke </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> - <ORGANIZATION> Roosevelt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>'s volunteer program to give the infants the human touch Nine women and eight men donate an hour each week to care for the hospital's boarder babies. `` Before the volunteers came up to hold the babies in the nursery, the babies were not reactive to anything,'' said <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Crosby </LOCATION>, director of volunteers at the medical center. `` They would just lie there. `` The staff would go in and feed them when they could. The babies did n't even react to sound after a while. `` Once the volunteers started, it was totally different,'' Ms. <PERSON> Crosby </PERSON> said. `` They began to react to the love and you could see a real difference.'' It was there in the face of the month-old boy <PERSON> Loretta </PERSON> <PERSON> Donato </PERSON> gently rocked in a dilapidated rocking chair inside St. <PERSON> Luke </PERSON>'s boarder baby nursery, a small, gray-walled room that would be cheerless if not for the efforts of the staff nurses who used their own money to decorate it Eight tiny `` cribs'' _ actually, miniature hospital beds, their iron sides disguised with white paint and brightened with colorful mobiles _ dominate the room. The desolate hospital walls are masked with a wallpaper border of skating bunnies. The `` Alice in Wonderland'' curtains remind Ms. <PERSON> Donato </PERSON> of the story of <PERSON> Alice </PERSON>'s tumble down the rabbit hole, and she tells it to the baby content in her lap. Across the room, <PERSON> Ian </PERSON> <PERSON> McCart </PERSON>, who like <PERSON> Belling </PERSON> is single, expertly changes a 2-week-old girl's diaper. <PERSON> McCart </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> banker who lives in <LOCATION> Westchester </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, went to the hospital 18 months ago to volunteer to help AIDS patients and met Ms. <PERSON> Crosby </PERSON>. One day, she coaxed him into going upstairs to look at the babies. `` I was hooked,'' he said. Now, every Thursday after work, he takes care of AIDS patients for an hour and then goes up to the nursery. `` I just love to sit quietly with the child and play -LRB- tape-recorded -RRB- classical music,'' <PERSON> McCart </PERSON> said. `` It's the first peace I have all day long.'' For <PERSON> Mel </PERSON> <PERSON> Heiko </PERSON>, a 65-year-old lawyer with two grown daughters and a 9-month-old grandson, the volunteer program is a second chance to experience fatherhood. When his own children were young, he said, `` I was too busy trying to carve out a career.'' `` Sometimes you sit there and wonder what's going to happen to them,'' said the 41-year-old Ms. <PERSON> Donato </PERSON>, a married advertising executive who would like to have children but says `` nature has not been so kind.'' `` I often sit there and create whole futures for them,'' she said. `` I like to think positive things. Maybe in some small way it will rub off.'' The volunteers never know where the babies go once they leave. `` I do n't think I want to know, to tell the truth,'' said <PERSON> Belling </PERSON>. `` A couple of times I've seen -LRB- the babies' -RRB- parents up there _ it's scary. `` I just think it's better for us and better for the babies if we just spend that time with them, make that little bit of difference.''

<HEAD>Last Survivor of Last U.S. Indian Massacre Looks Back</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NICHOLAS K. GERANIOS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>YAKIMA, Wash. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The last survivor of what many historians regard as the last massacre of Indians in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> history thinks returning to the site after more than seven decades may finally bring the scope of the tragedy home to her. `` It would be strange because I feel like I stand off from all of it,'' said <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Jo </PERSON> <PERSON> Estepp </PERSON>, who was an 18-month-old child when taken from her dead mother's back after the ambush in <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> in 1911. `` It's in the distance, you know.'' Though she is now making plans for the visit with friends, she lived most of her 78 or so years with only an outline of her past. Many details were finally supplied a few years ago by the author of a book about her grandfather, an Indian named <PERSON> Shoshone </PERSON> <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> who refused to live on a reservation. The ambush, by a white posse, left <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> and seven other Indians dead in the snow near <LOCATION> Winnemucca </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nev. </LOCATION>, on Feb. 26, 1911, 21 years after the last major <LOCATION> Indian </LOCATION> massacre, at Wounded Knee, S.D. According to researchers, <PERSON> Shoshone </PERSON> <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> refused to settle on the Fort Hall Indian Reservation in <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> and instead roamed the mountains near Twin Falls with his sons, daughters and grandchildren. The Indians lived off the land and worked for farmers, living in peace. But in 1910 one of <PERSON> Mike </PERSON>'s sons was killed by a white horse thief, and the family retaliated by killing the killer. Not trusting white justice, <PERSON> Shoshone </PERSON> <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> took his family and fled into <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION>. The 12 Indians survived a brutal winter by stealing cattle for food. When four ranchers discovered the loss, the Indians killed them and took their horses. Posses from <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> pursued the Indians for 300 miles until Feb. 26, when they caught the ragged band sleeping and slaughtered four men, two women and two boys during a brief battle. One posse member was killed. The four surviving children were put in the <PERSON> Reno </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Nev. </LOCATION>, jail because there was no place else to put them. In his 1973 book about <PERSON> Shoshone </PERSON> <PERSON> Mike </PERSON>, titled `` The Last Free Man,'' author <PERSON> Dayton </PERSON> <PERSON> Hyde </PERSON> noted the four surviving children, but he was unable to find out what happened to them. A friend of Ms. <PERSON> Estep </PERSON> contacted <PERSON> Hyde </PERSON> after reading his book, and <PERSON> Hyde </PERSON> traveled to her home in <LOCATION> Yakima </LOCATION>. There is still much Ms. <PERSON> Estep </PERSON> does n't know about the time before she was lifted from that blood-soaked cradleboard after falling face-down in the snow. The identity of her father is unclear, as is her age and whether she was born a Shoshone or a Bannock Indian. Still, she said, `` They know my mother was one of Shoshone <PERSON> Mike </PERSON>'s daughters. Her name was Snake.'' The massacre in <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> appears to have been the last of its kind in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Bergon </PERSON>, a professor of Native American cultures at <ORGANIZATION> Vassar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Poughkeepsie </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, whose novel, `` Shoshone <PERSON> Mike </PERSON>,'' was recently published by <PERSON> Viking </PERSON>. <PERSON> Hyde </PERSON> agrees. Many massacres of whites and Indians occurred in the 19th century. `` What makes this significant is it occurred in 1911, when there were automobiles, airplanes and movies,'' <PERSON> Bergon </PERSON> said. `` The fact that it did occur in the 20th century makes the whole thing surreal.'' After the massacre, the federal government ordered <PERSON> Evan </PERSON> <PERSON> Estep </PERSON>, then the superintendent of the <ORGANIZATION> Fort </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Indian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reservation </ORGANIZATION>, to pick up the children. Ms. <PERSON> Estep </PERSON>'s memories begin with the train trip north in November 1911. `` I remember when we went to the dining car I would n't eat the food,'' she said. The exception was raisins in the raisin bread, which tided her over. They may have reminded her of food her family ate, but she is n't sure. The other three children died of illnesses within a year. The toddler survived tuberculosis and was adopted by <PERSON> Estep </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Rita </PERSON>, who were childless. They guessed she was about 18 months old when she was found. She moved with the family to reservations in <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, finally settling at <LOCATION> Toppenish </LOCATION> on the <ORGANIZATION> Yakima </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Indian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reservation </ORGANIZATION> in 1924. Although her adoptive parents told her about the massacre, she never asked for details and they never talked much about <PERSON> Shoshone </PERSON> <PERSON> Mike </PERSON>, she said. She was treated as a white person and noted, `` Most of my friends are non-Indians.'' The family moved to <LOCATION> Yakima </LOCATION> in 1930, after <PERSON> Estep </PERSON> retired. Ms. <PERSON> Estep </PERSON> still lives in the house purchased by her adoptive parents, who died in the 1950s. She graduated from <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> with a music degree and spent 40 years teaching school before retiring in 1974. She never married. Her only tangible link with her Indian past is a single black-and-white photograph of the four surviving children taken in front of the Reno jail. It shows the children she had thought were siblings until <PERSON> Hyde </PERSON> identified them: an aunt, <PERSON> Hattie </PERSON>, age about 4; an uncle, <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION>, about 7; and another aunt, <PERSON> Heney </PERSON>, who appears to be about 18. And, of course, the haunting photo shows herself, wearing a white hat and crying.

<TEXT>
 If you're a 6-foot-tall 13-year-old who ca n't dribble a basketball, one of your options is to crack wise For <PERSON> Brad </PERSON> <PERSON> Garrett </PERSON>, now 6-foot-9 and the star of CBS' `` First Impressions,'' making jokes to make up for two left feet became a successful career as a standup comedian. Now he's joined a growing legion of comics _ <PERSON> Garry </PERSON> <PERSON> Shandling </PERSON>, <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Reiser </PERSON>, <PERSON> Roseanne </PERSON> <PERSON> Barr </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Saget </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Coulier </PERSON>, for instance _ who have made the transition from standup comedy to situation comedy. `` It's funny,'' <PERSON> Garrett </PERSON> said. `` The transition a comedian has to make, it seems, from the standup to the acting is trusting the silence, not getting that immediate reaction and being comfortable with that, because we're trained to be on the defense and always have something to say.'' What <PERSON> Garrett </PERSON> has to say often comes out in other people's voices `` First Impressions'' revolves around its star's ability to mimic everybody from <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Cosby </PERSON> to <PERSON> Hulk </PERSON> <PERSON> Hogan </PERSON>. <PERSON> Garrett </PERSON> plays a voiceover actor in a small <LOCATION> Omaha </LOCATION> ad agency. He's also a single parent trying to raise a teen-age daughter -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Brandy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gold </ORGANIZATION> -RRB-. `` First Impressions'' was to have been a summer replacement series, but the writers strike pushed it into a more important role as a quasi-fall series. It premiered Aug. 27 and runs until Oct. 22. The show is <PERSON> Garrett </PERSON>'s second attempt at a sitcom. He made a pilot a couple of years ago called `` Super Tomato.'' `` It was about a grocery store,'' he said. `` Yeah. Wonderful. And I was a clerk. ... I could send you a tape of that, really whip your weekend into a frenzy, I think.'' Before that, <PERSON> Garrett </PERSON> honed his standup skills, eventually landing on the <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION> casino circuit. He chatted at a restaurant in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> on a break as the opening act with the <PERSON> Julio </PERSON> <PERSON> Iglesias </PERSON> tour. <PERSON> Iglesias </PERSON>, he said, watched his act, but did n't always get it since the Spanish singer does n't speak much English. `` Unless you do an impression of <PERSON> Tito </PERSON> <PERSON> Puente </PERSON>, he's totally lost,'' <PERSON> Garrett </PERSON> noted. The tour included 11 nights at Radio City Music Hall, not bad for a 28-year-old comic. `` It's a dream to be able to walk out there without a flashlight,'' <PERSON> Garrett </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Garrett </PERSON> is pretty darn noticeable even in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>, just by virtue of his height, but he was sporting a large, scraggly scar down the middle of his nose that would draw a second look even in this tough town. He had fallen off <PERSON> Iglesias </PERSON>' tour bus on a stop in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>. Clumsiness is what propelled <PERSON> Garrett </PERSON> into comedy, he said. He moved around a lot as a kid. Imagine the reaction of basketball coaches when he would arrive on the scene. `` I was n't a jock. I mean, I ca n't walk and talk. ... I never had the moves. Jews do n't dribble anyway. It's the heritage. `` Everytime I'd go to a new school they -LRB- the coaches -RRB- would say, this is it, this is the guy we've been waiting for, and when I'd get on the court it was embarrassing So I got into theater.'' Getting into television was a little harder, a matter of getting through the door _ literally. The producers of `` First Impressions'' were so impressed by their 6-foot-9 find, they constructed a special set to tone down the impact of his height on screen. `` They had to make the set like 3 inches taller, enlarge the doors and the countertops and the chairs,'' <PERSON> Garrett </PERSON> said. `` The ` elephant man' set I call it.'' `` First Impressions'' airs Saturdays at 8 p.m. EDT.

<HEAD>Interest Rates Worry The Market</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The big `` whew'' from the stock market last Friday came from evidence that inflationary pressures, and therefore interest rate increases, might possibly be easing. As has happened a hundred times in the past, Wall Street once again is mesmerized by inflation and interest-rate possibilities, and it reacts almost instantly to any news on the subject. A high or rising level of interest rates is of special importance to the stock market for at least two reasons: _ First, it is generally agreed that the stock market collapse of last October was triggered, at least in part, by rates rising to levels that made debt securities more rewarding than stocks _ Next, high or rising interest rates become an important factor in the cost of doing business, as well as a disincentive to market expansion at all levels from consumers to manufacturers Another reason might be added: The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> has been watching job figures for a clue to inflation. Strong job figures might convince it to raise rates; a weaker job market would mean an easing of pressure. After viewing the figures, Wall Street concluded that the inflation threat might not be as bad as feared, and that the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> would have less reason to push up interest rates. But the the threat is not over, and <PERSON> Wall </PERSON> <PERSON> Steet </PERSON> will continue to focus on borrowing costs and inflation. <ORGANIZATION> Wright </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investors </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> presents the case: At current interest-rate levels, says <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, which advises on billions of dollars of investment funds, the possibility of new lows in stock prices _ lower than those of last October _ can not be dismissed. It points out that short-term interest rates are now more than 1 percentage point higher than they were one year ago at the stock market peak, while long-term <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> yields are around one-half percentage point higher. In fact, high-quality corporate bonds offer a return nearly 2 percentage points higher than that available on stocks, a situation that is out of whack with recent history. Over the past 20 years, stock earnings yields have averaged the same as long-term bond yields. Prior to 1984, says <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, bond yields as high as today's would have precluded a stock price-earnings ratio of more than 10. Thus, says <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, `` the current stock market price-earnings multiple of 12, while only average for the postwar period, may yet prove to be excessive in today's environment.'' Is the obsession with interest rates overdone? Does it ignore positive factors? Perhaps. Investor confidence could be supported by other aspects of the economy that show it to be stronger than a year ago, despite its advanced age. Corporate earnings are setting records. Price-earnings ratios have shrunk. Corporate takeover activities continue to remove stock from the market, thus creating a relative shortage of equities. And investor psychology is much healthier. A year ago, you may recall, investors floated on a cloud of euphoria and cared little for such fundamental considerations as real value. Now they fear the market; they study fundamentals, and they do n't take chances. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> agrees that these are indeed encouraging signs. Nevertheless, <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> and a host of other analysts wonder if those interest rates still might not knock prices down as they did last year. So long as the threat exists, says <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, the bull market will have to wait. When will it come? You can be confident, it concludes, that a new bull market will get under way next year. Which means, in effect, that those interest-rate worries will have abated.

 Asians are keeping a close eye on an immigration debate in <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> to see if it will mean a slow down in the flow of <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> emigrants into the country. Some Asians say they see signs of racism. Several Asian newspapers have published editorials reminding <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> of its growing economic links with <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> countries. `` The outcome of the intense immigration debate now under way in <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> will either confirm or confound the view Asians hold that a strong undercurrent of racism exists in the ` Lucky Country','' the conservative English-language <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> China </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morning </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> said. `` While <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> was founded on British values, the facts today are that politically and economically the country can not always look West.'' In <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>, a growing influx of Asian migrants is in the background of a debate over immigration rules and multi-culturalism _ a policy that encourages migrants to keep cultural links with their homelands. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Howard </PERSON>, leader of <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>'s opposition <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, says immigration from <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> should be slowed in the interests of social harmony and that immigrants should embrace the English-speaking majority's Anglo-Saxon cultural values. `` I am not saying I would end Asian immigration,'' he said. `` But what I am saying is that it is a legitimate concern of any community and any government to say that it is imposing social tensions and that it is imposing a lack of social cohesion.'' The government has proposed legislation that would prohibit the use of race or ethnic origins as criteria for judging potential immigrants' acceptability. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON>, who heads a two-party national opposition, is against the bill but has lost support recently in Parliament. Prime Minister <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Hawke </PERSON>, of the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, has vowed to fight any move to restrict <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> immigration and says he would maintain a policy of non-discrimination even if he thought it would mean losing an election. <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>, a continent with only 16 million people near <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>'s huge population of 3 billion, is an attractive destination for emigrants It is called `` lucky'' because of its rich resources and comfortable climate. The Australian Bureau of Statistics says the number of <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> immigrants climbed by one-third in the past year. Out of 116,430 immigrants between January and November 1987, 47,450 were Asians, compared with 36,360 in the same period in 1986. <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> has taken in 100,000 Vietnamese since 1975, when the <LOCATION> Indochina </LOCATION> war ended, and has a growing Chinese community. Emigration counselors in several <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> countries list <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> as attractive for its climate, proximity and educational opportunities for children. Increasing numbers of Asians with capital and business experience are snowing interest in emigrating to <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> now surpassed <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> as the top choice of emigrants. `` People here barely knew anything about <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> three years ago,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Chang </PERSON>, manager of <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Queter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Company </ORGANIZATION>, which handles emigration applications to <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>. `` But emigrating to <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> has become a fad now.'' <PERSON> Chang </PERSON> said he understood why <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> had doubled the capital requirement for business emigrants to 500,000 Australian dollars -LRB- $ 410,000 -RRB- in the past year. `` <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> no longer needs foreign capital and personnel now as much as before. It is only natural that it closes the door a bit.'' In <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, where emigration is on the upswing due to nervousness over <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s taking sovereignty of the British colony in 1997, <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> is the second most popular destination after <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Janet </PERSON> <PERSON> Sekavs </PERSON>, regional migration director in <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>'s Consulate in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, said 6,431 Filipinos emigrated to <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> in 1986, compared with 5,140 from <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> and 5,032 from <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION> <PERSON> Chan </PERSON> <PERSON> Ka-wai </PERSON>, editor of The Emigrant, <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>'s magazine on emigration, said he thought the number of emigration applications would remain high even if <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> imposes new curbs. `` <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> is strange,'' <PERSON> Chan </PERSON> said. `` It is in <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> but it does not treat itself as an Asian country. It is a multi-racial country and economically it should have the potential to accept more people.'' <PERSON> Susie </PERSON> <PERSON> Tse </PERSON>, migration service manager of Price Waterhouse emigration consultancy in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, said, `` It would be racist if <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> refuses Asians. But from my nine years' experience in <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>, I have not felt any racism and am not sure if it is just over-exaggeration by the press.'' The fiercest reaction has come from a <LOCATION> Malaysian </LOCATION> newspaper, the Star in <LOCATION> Kuala </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lumpur </LOCATION>, where editor V.K. <PERSON> Chin </PERSON> wrote in a recent column that Australians he described as racists make <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> immigrants `` feel inadequate, insecure and even sub-human.'' `` Based on the statements of some of these pillars of the Australian political establishment, it would appear that inside every Liberal senator or member of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> is a racist struggling to get out,'' <PERSON> Chin </PERSON> wrote. `` <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> may be a big, wide-open country but it is in danger of being led by small-minded people with petty prejudices and attitudes more suited to the Victorian age.''

 Only a few birds are chirping at 8:30 a.m. when the sounds of <PERSON> Tchaikovsky </PERSON>'s Piano Concerto No. 5 fill the woods of this northern <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> town. The World Youth Symphony is rehearsing for an upcoming performance. The music flows with deceiving precision: One could be listening to a symphony orchestra, not a collection of high school musicians at summer camp. But this is anything but an ordinary summer camp. `` This place is a paradox because the natural aspect is serene, but serene is hardly the word to describe the activity here. It's crazy,'' said <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilkins </PERSON>, chairman of the camp's visual arts department The National Music Camp, the 61st edition of which ended in August, attracts 2,100 campers from third grade through high school. They come from all 50 states and 26 foreign countries to spend a summer of intensive study in music, dance, drama and the visual arts. Many campers already are accomplished in their chosen field. They come to hone their skills at the camp, which is spread over 1,200 acres and has about 450 buildings. The camper-staff ratio is almost two to one, and private lessons are available for those who want them. `` These are bright kids, and many of them are extremely well-equipped for a career in the arts,'' said <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Oosting </PERSON>, director of the camp's theater program. With such a collection of talent, competition among campers can get intense. `` People come to the National Music Camp to see how they stack up,'' said <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Downing </PERSON>, the camp's director. `` A lot of big decisions can be made during the summer as young people decide on a possible career in the arts.'' Perhaps the most intense competition occurs every Friday, when violinists in The World Youth Symphony challenge each other for the right to sit in the first chair. The competition is known as `` Bloody Friday.'' `` There are people who take it too seriously, but competition has always been a part of being here,'' Downing said. `` We like to think it's friendly competition and we try to keep it that way. `` It's an opportunity for the camper to show how he or she has progressed, not necessarily to beat the next person ahead of you.'' Despite the emphasis on the arts, campers enjoy their free time like others their age. Many boys and girls like to find a secluded spot in the evening to talk quietly. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolff </PERSON>, a high school student from <LOCATION> Warren </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>, said some campers like to play classical music but never would listen to it on their own. `` It's kind of humorous,'' he said. `` People will play <PERSON> Mozart </PERSON> and <PERSON> Beethoven </PERSON>, then come back to their cabin and listen to a Led Zeppelin cassette.'' The camp's scenic location is a main reason youngsters get so much out of the program. `` This place is absolutely conducive to clearing your mind and focusing on your work,'' <PERSON> Oosting </PERSON> said. `` You need blue skies and varied visual stimuli.'' The camp, which was founded in 1927, also does its best to make sure the kids are kept busy. Campers in the theater department can be involved in up to three plays at one time. However, said <PERSON> Oosting </PERSON>, the theater program can be daunting. Rehearsal time is limited because the camp's activities are structured in 50-minute periods. `` Most <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> and <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> operettas are 2 -LCB- hours long, but are rehearsed and staged here in 50-minute periods,'' he said. `` In most cases, until the actual performance, it's probably never been run through from beginning to end.'' Campers belie their youth in terms of dedication to their specialty. At night, it is not unusual to hear the sounds of a violin or horn coming from cabins, as campers practice on their own. During the day, the youth bustle from one class to the next _ walking quickly with a clear sense of purpose. <PERSON> Wolff </PERSON> said he would like to become an opera singer, a career goal shared by few of his peers. `` When I was 14 and listening to opera, it was hard for some people to handle,'' he said. `` But I do n't limit myself to listening to just opera, I listen to all kinds of music.'' The rules at the camp can be interpreted as strict. All campers are required to wear a uniform _ blue corduroy pants for boys and knickers for girls and blue shirts for all. Campers from third through ninth grade are not allowed to leave the grounds during the eight-week session. High schoolers are permitted to leave only with their parents or other pre-approved adults. `` Yeah, sometimes the rules get out of hand, but it's really trivial compared with what you're learning,'' <PERSON> Wolff </PERSON> said.

 The first reports from the control tower indicated the crash was `` non-survivable.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 727 skipped through a dry, rock-hard field off the end of a runway, lost its right wing, turned 90 degrees and caught fire. `` There was a humongous fireball. I did n't think anybody had made it,'' said <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Centron </PERSON>, a toll booth worker who also witnessed the fiery crash of a <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lines </ORGANIZATION> jumbo jet three years ago here. Yet one by one, passengers crawled and clawed their way to daylight, some through doors, other through cracks in the aluminum shell of this <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> jet, Flight 1141 of Wednesday. Some helped mothers get their babies out. The pilot, pinned in the cockpit under a pile of debris, kept telling passengers, `` Slow down. Watch your step.'' Somehow, 95 survived. One woman ran to a road and flagged down a ride back to the terminal. Another man said he's been hurt worse shaving. Just 24 hours after the crash, 62 people had been treated at hospitals and released. Thirteen people died. But experts and officials who specialize in dealing with disaster called the relatively low death toll a miracle. `` I had expected fewer survivors,'' said <PERSON> Julia </PERSON> <PERSON> Wells </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Parkland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> emergency-disaster team nurse who arrived by helicopter. `` When you see a plane that looks like that, you do n't expect that many to be walking around.'' While the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> evaluates the cause of Flight 1141's disaster, investigators say they also are studying why so many survived. `` It's a particularly important opportunity for accident investigators,'' said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Transportation Secretary <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Burnley </PERSON>. Rescue workers credit their experience of the <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> crash three years ago with preparing them for a fast, efficient effort. The <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION> had criticized the response to the crash of <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> flight 191, saying no coordinated effort was in place to handle the victims. `` There's no comparison. Everything went so smoothly,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cpl </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>. `` When we got here,'' paramedic supervisor <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Sympson </PERSON> said, `` it was click, click, click.'' And speed of evacuation, whether through the work of rescue workers or the calm and capabilities of those on the plane, may have been the key. `` It appears we got a majority of the passengers out before the fire really set in,'' said <PERSON> Oris </PERSON> <PERSON> Dunham </PERSON>, executive director of the <LOCATION> Dallas-Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>. `` Most of the fire occurred after the plane was evacuated.'' Those on board said somehow, calm prevailed. Passengers waited in line to crawl through a hole in the fuselage, and helped each other out. Smoke filled the cabin, some crawled on the floor. Many could see the ominous orange flames of burning jet fuel. `` It was kind of surprising,'' said <PERSON> Andy </PERSON> <PERSON> Dyer </PERSON>, a passenger who was on his way to help fight forest fires in <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>. `` There was n't any screaming hardly at all. It was real quiet. I think everybody was aware of what was going on.'' All but two who died were found in the rear of the aircraft, many by an exit door that would not open. In fact, it took workers one hour Thursday to jar the door loose. The plane hit the ground at the tail, investigators said. Fuel from the ruptured right wing is thought to have sprayed the rear and touched off the fire. The right engine was found 100 feet away. The cockpit section of the 727 broke open, fire burned through the plane's skin and melted the plastic windows. Yet the plane had come to rest without hitting any structures, like two water tanks several hundred yards ahead. It was a similar water tank that caused <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> 191 to break up and explode, investigators said. That crash killed 137 people. For those back in the <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> terminal, it seemed horrifyingly obvious what had happened. A cloud of black smoke, and eventually live television pictures of the charred carcass of an airplane had most, including relatives of passengers, assuming the worst. `` My husband was on the plane,'' <PERSON> JoAnn </PERSON> <PERSON> Waugh </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> cried to a chaplain at the terminal. Later, she sprinted for an exit, racing to a nearby hospital where her husband, <LOCATION> Penn </LOCATION>, was being treated for minor injuries. `` I'm the luckiest person in the world,'' she shouted as she ran. `` God is so good.''

 Oil futures prices have responded negatively to a report of more overproduction by <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION>. On the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, contracts for October delivery of <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intermediate </ORGANIZATION>, the benchmark <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> crude oil, fell 10 cents per barrel to close at $ 15.08 Thursday. Other contract months also dropped. Contracts for refined petroleum products finished mixed. Wholesale unleaded gasoline for October delivery rose 0.36 cent to finish at 44.71 a gallon. The September gasoline contract fell 1.49 cents Wednesday, the last trading day before the contract expired. Contracts for other months mostly were lower. Wholesale heating oil for October rose 0.14 cent to 43.46 cents a gallon while other contract months were mixed. Analysts said the strength in gasoline and heating oil prevented further declines in crude oil. They attributed the recent gains in refined products to poor refinery economics. Outdated equipment, for example, has lowered refinery capacity, keeping supply and demand nearly equal, they said. `` Refining capacity has been pared down to the point where refiners are having problems just keeping up with day to day demand,'' said <PERSON> Jayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Ball </PERSON>, a commodity oil broker with <ORGANIZATION> Dean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Witter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reynolds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. Analysts said crude oil recovered from midday lows in response to reports that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Emirates </LOCATION> would exceed its production quota set by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries In recent days, oil futures prices weakened after reports that <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION>'s 13 member nations were exceeding their collective quotas by more than 3 million barrels. `` All this overproduction in a market where demand factors have n't been substantial tends to be a price weakening factor and the market goes down,'' Ms. <PERSON> Ball </PERSON> said. `` <LOCATION> UAE </LOCATION> claims it's going to have production up to 1.9 million barrels per day, more than double its quota, which is about 990,000 barrels.'' Ongoing uncertainty about developments between <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> also softened crude prices Thursday, traders said.

Lord <PERSON> Geller </PERSON>, which had competed to keep the account and expected to retain at least some of it, has worked for <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> since 1979, creating the Chaplinesque ads and, more recently, a series of <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> ads reuniting the former stars of the television show `` M-A-S-H.'' <PERSON> Lintas </PERSON> is best known for its Cover Girl, <ORGANIZATION> Diet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coke </ORGANIZATION> and Chevrolet ads, while <PERSON> Wells </PERSON> <PERSON> Rich </PERSON> <PERSON> Greene </PERSON> makes ads for <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Benson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Hedges cigarettes `` We received shocking news this afternoon,'' Lord <PERSON> Geller </PERSON> executives told the agency's employees in a memo. `` <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> has decided to move its account to two large agencies.'' <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Wardell </PERSON>, <PERSON> Lord </PERSON> <PERSON> Geller </PERSON> president, said he hopes the agency can win another computer account over the next few months while it continues to work through during a transitional period for <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION>. `` There has been no talk whatsoever about closing,'' he said. <PERSON> Lord </PERSON> <PERSON> Geller </PERSON>, a unit of <ORGANIZATION> WPP </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION>, has been in turmoil since six of its top executives, including chairman <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Lord </PERSON> and president <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Einstein </PERSON>, walked off the job on March 18 to form their own agency, blaming interference from <ORGANIZATION> WPP </ORGANIZATION>'s management. London-based <ORGANIZATION> WPP </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> acquired Lord <PERSON> Geller </PERSON> along with the much larger <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> ad agency in mid-1987 when it bought <ORGANIZATION> JWT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>. The defectors eventually were joined by a number of Lord <PERSON> Geller </PERSON> employees, including about 25 people who formerly worked on the <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> account. The breakaway led to a contentious and unresolved court fight between <ORGANIZATION> WPP </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> and the new agency and its leaders. In early June, <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> said it would review its agency requirements and advertising direction and invited a limited number of agencies to compete for the assignment, including both Lord <PERSON> Geller </PERSON> and the breakaway agency, Lord <PERSON> Einstein </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Neill </PERSON> & amp; Partners. <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Theo </PERSON> <PERSON> Chisholm </PERSON> said the company heard presentations from six agencies.

In announcing its decision, <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> declined to say how much it spends on advertising or how that spending will be split between the agencies. It said <PERSON> Lintas </PERSON> will be responsible for <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> desktop products, including the Personal System-2 line of personal computers, while <ORGANIZATION> Wells </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rich </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Greene </ORGANIZATION> will do corporate advertising as well as `` marketing image advertising and solutions advertising programs.'' At Lord <PERSON> Einstein </PERSON>, Chairman <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Lord </PERSON> said he was disappointed but added, `` We never expected any <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> business when we left there.''

<HEAD>Weather, Fashion Problems Blamed For August Slump</HEAD>

<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 The nation's largest general retailers still are waiting for business to improve after continuing problems in apparel lines and unusually hot weather depressed sales again during August. `` It is not encouraging as a harbinger of what back-to-school and fall is going to look like,'' <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Ronning </PERSON>, a retail industry analyst with the investment firm <ORGANIZATION> Brown </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Harriman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, said after reviewing sales results announced Thursday by storeowners. `` Some of the companies did worse in August than they did in June and July,'' said <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Wintzer </PERSON>, an analyst with <PERSON> Alex </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Brown </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sons </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION>. Several analysts blamed the August slump on the abnormally hot weather parts of the country suffered through last month. <PERSON> Jeffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Feiner </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, said the underlying sluggish trend in consumer spending _ which began in February 1987 _ also remained in place. Retail sales have been a soft spot in an otherwise strong economy. Consumer spending, which also includes outlays for food, medical care, autos, utilities, transportation and other necessities, is closely watched because it accounts for two-thirds of the gross national product. Some analysts dismissed the weather as a factor. <PERSON> Monroe </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenstein </PERSON>, of <ORGANIZATION> Bear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stearns </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, noted sales were disappointing on the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> despite more normal temperatures there. <PERSON> Greenstein </PERSON> said women are still disenchanted with retailers' fashion lines It was a year ago, in August 1987, that apparel retailers fell into a slide as women refused to buy shorter skirts and clothes they perceived as boring. `` A lot of retailers are pushing back their expectations for a good pickup in business until October,'' <PERSON> Greenstein </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Jeffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Edelman </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, said it was too early to get a good reading on how well the new apparel lines are faring, but he said `` it appears as if some of the new fashion is better than it was last year.'' <PERSON> Edelman </PERSON> said some stores have reported a pickup in business this week. Those sales will be reflected in retailers' September sales figures. Several companies recorded sales increases under 3 percent, meaning the stores were losing ground to inflation, which has run at an annual rate of 4.5 percent so far this year. The nation's largest retailer, <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Roebuck </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, said its overall sales rose 6.3 percent from August 1987 levels, and its sales for the first 30 weeks of the fiscal year increased 5.5 percent from the same period a year earlier. Sales from <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> stores open at least a year _ known in the trade as same-store sales _ were up 1.3 percent last month and 2 percent for the year to date. Retailers and industry analysts believe same-store sales are a more accurate yardstick of a company's performance than figures which include sales from new stores. However, not all retailers report both their overall and same-store results. K mart said its sales rose 6.4 percent in August, and 5.4 percent for the year so far. The retailer's same-store sales rose 2.2 percent for the month and 1.9 percent year-to-date. <ORGANIZATION> Wal-Mart </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> said its sales rose 24 percent overall last month, and have risen 30 percent so far this year. Its same-store sales were up 8 percent in August, and have risen 12 percent during the first seven months. <ORGANIZATION> J.C. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Penney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> suffered a 2.6 percent drop in overall sales last month, while sales for the year so far were up 1.8 percent Same-store sales were down 3.4 percent last month while rising 0.7 percent for the year so far. <ORGANIZATION> Dayton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hudson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> said its overall sales rose 15 percent last month and 17.3 percent year-to-date. Same-store sales rose 1.7 percent in August and 1.5 percent for the first 30 weeks. May <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> had a 19.6 percent jump in overall sales in August while year-to-date sales improved 13 percent. May's same-store sales were up 1.5 percent last month, and 1.3 percent for the year so far F.W. <ORGANIZATION> Woolworth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> reported a 12 percent increase in August sales, and an 11.9 percent rise for the first 30 weeks. <ORGANIZATION> Montgomery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ward </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> said its August sales were up 4.7 percent, while year-to-date sales rose 3 percent. The results were from general merchandise and apparel retailers. Unlike monthly retail sales figures released by the federal government, they do not include sales at auto dealers, supermarkets or restaurants.

 A partial merger between the <ORGANIZATION> Detroit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Detroit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Free </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> would mean trouble for the 25 other <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> cities that still have competing newspapers, according to an <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION> newspaper. The <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION> Democrat of Little Rock filed a legal brief Thursday supporting efforts to block a proposed joint operating agreement between the News, owned by <ORGANIZATION> Gannett </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, and the <ORGANIZATION> Free </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, owned by <ORGANIZATION> Knight-Ridder </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION> The Democrat's main competitor is the <ORGANIZATION> Arkansas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gazette </ORGANIZATION>, which is owned by <ORGANIZATION> Gannett </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's largest newspaper chain. <ORGANIZATION> Gannett </ORGANIZATION> bought the <ORGANIZATION> Gazette </ORGANIZATION> in 1986, the same year it acquired the News. Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> approved the <ORGANIZATION> Detroit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> JOA </ORGANIZATION> on Aug. 8, shortly before leaving office. Court challenges followed, and the partial merger was delayed at least until next week, when it is to be reviewed by a federal judge in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. `` A decision approving the <ORGANIZATION> JOA </ORGANIZATION> in this case would be a decision providing a blueprint for the elimination of competition in the remaining 25 cities with two newspapers,'' the Democrat's attorneys said. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s decision, in designating the Free Press a failing newspaper, ignored evidence that the newspaper's losses resulted from strategic decisions rather than market economics, the brief said. The Democrat asked the court `` to rule that a newspaper is not failing when its losses are the result of predation.'' The Democrat's brief said <ORGANIZATION> Gannett </ORGANIZATION> operated both the News and the <ORGANIZATION> Arkansas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gazette </ORGANIZATION> at substantial losses in order to force smaller competitors to incur more painful losses. `` <ORGANIZATION> Gannett </ORGANIZATION>'s strategy in acquiring the newspapers in <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Little </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rock </LOCATION> was not to operate either profitably in a competitive market, but was instead to eliminate competition either by destroying its rival or by forcing its rival into a joint operating arrangement,'' the brief said. Six days after <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> approved the <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> agreement, the <ORGANIZATION> Gazette </ORGANIZATION> lowered subscription prices to 85 cents per week from $ 1.98 per week, the brief said. <ORGANIZATION> Gannett </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Sheila </PERSON> <PERSON> Owens </PERSON> said the company would not comment immediately on the Democrat's allegations. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Malone </PERSON>, publisher of the <ORGANIZATION> Arkansas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gazette </ORGANIZATION>, said the <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> agreement `` has nothing to do with us at all here at the Gazette.'' `` Number one, this price reduction was on the drawing board long before we knew anything about the outcome of the <ORGANIZATION> JOA </ORGANIZATION> situation in <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>,'' he said. `` Number two, we're not trying to put them out of business. `` If you will look at the things we have done, it's just to match them _ free classifieds, we matched them with free classifieds. As far as circulation pricing, all we've been doing is matching what they've already been doing.'' The <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> agreement would merge News and Free Press production and business operations while keeping separate the newspapers' news and editorial departments. Profits and losses would be shared equally by the newspapers after the first five years of the 100-year agreement. The newspapers sought exemption from federal antitrust laws under the Newspaper Preservation Act, which allows such partial mergers when one of the newspapers is declared in danger of failing.

<HEAD>Japan's Current Account Surplus In July Declines</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> posted a current account surplus of $ 6.48 billion in July, down 11 percent from $ 7.28 billion a year earlier but up slightly from $ 6.43 billion in June, the <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> said Friday. The current account is the broadest measure of trade and includes goods, services and investment income plus various monetary transfers and aid payments. The surplus in the trade of goods alone widened from the year-earlier level for the first time in 13 months, going up to $ 8.76 billion from $ 8.58 billion. It also was up from a $ 7.38 billion surplus registered in June. The ministry said it is too early to conclude that <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s downtrend in the trade surplus has come to a halt The July rise in the merchandise trade surplus had been reported in early August using a slightly different measure that made it the first such increase in 15 months. The trade surplus, the main target of criticism from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, European countries and other major trade partners of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, had been declining consistently due to the yen's sharp appreciation since 1985. A higher yen would restrain exports by making Japanese goods less competitive abroad. Exports in July rose 16.8 percent over a year earlier to $ 22.8 billion, while imports surged 28.2 percent to a record $ 14.0 billion. Ministry officials said exports of ships, office automation equipment, semiconductors, television sets and cameras were strong. Exports also included parts and components that Japanese companies shipped to their subsidiaries in other <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> countries for assembly, they said. No breakdown of the trade surplus by countries or regions was given.

The lawsuits, which also name <ORGANIZATION> Northrop </ORGANIZATION> as a defendant, seek the return of all salaries and other compensation paid the directors, officers and outside consultants as well as unspecified damages to be paid to <ORGANIZATION> Northrop </ORGANIZATION>.

 As any casual follower of the stock market knows, a lot of the market's recent woes have been blamed on rising interest rates. But it is the way rates have been rising, even more than the simple fact that they have been moving up, that particularly troubles some analysts. With several nudges from the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION>, short-term interest rates -LRB- on debt securities with lives of a year or less -RRB- have climbed more sharply of late than long-term rates -LRB- on bonds with maturities of up to 30 years -RRB-. That means that what Wall Streeters call the yield curve, a graphic representation of the relationship between short - and long-term rates, is flattening If it inverts _ that is, if short-term rates go higher than long-term rates _ many analysts believe it would be a sign of significant trouble for both the stock market and the economy. Normally, interest rates on long-term debt tend to be higher than on short-term loans because long-term borrowers expose themselves to greater risk that the purchasing power of their money will be eroded by inflation, or that the issuer of the debt will default. So when the yield curve tilts in the opposite direction, it is widely taken as a sign that something is out of whack. Inverted yield curves showed up early in the bear markets and recessions that occurred in 1973-74 and again at the beginning of the 1980s. `` If the yield curve inverts, there is a very high probability that a recession will follow,'' said <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Berge </PERSON> <PERSON> Kent </PERSON>, an analyst at <ORGANIZATION> Tucker </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Anthony </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; R.L. <ORGANIZATION> Day </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, in a recent commentary. Recently, she noted, the ratio of rates on three-month <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bills to those on 30-year <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bonds stood at .78. `` If the ratio rises above .80 and the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> does not cut the discount rate, historical probability indicates that the yield curve will invert,'' she said. Another cause for concern, in the view of <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Sorrentino </PERSON>, technical analyst at <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Poor </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, is the fact that rates on three-month T-bills, at more than 7 percent, are higher than the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>'s discount rate, which it recently raised from 6 percent to 6.5 percent. `` Such a positive spread is a sign of a restrictive <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> policy, which usually places downward pressure on the stock market,'' <PERSON> Sorrentino </PERSON> said. `` Until the T-bill rate falls below the discount rate, this measure will remain in a bearish mode.'' Analysts at the financial advisory service <PERSON> Donoghue </PERSON>'s Moneyletter say managers of money market mutual funds have also been sounding a warning about interest rates and the financial outlook in recent months As a group, these managers have been shortening the average maturities of the securities in their portfolios. The standard motive for shortening maturities is to avoid or minimize price declines for existing securities when interest rates rise, and to have money available soon to invest at higher rates. `` When these managers believe interest rates are poised for a rise, they invest their funds in shorter-term securities,'' the newsletter said. `` Since the shortening began, the stock market generally has been moving sideways, and it recently has declined in the face of higher interest rates.''

 Futures prices for grain and soybeans opened slightly lower today on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> on profit-taking ahead of the long Labor Day weekend. `` We had some pretty good gains here during the week and now people are cashing in,'' said <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Lespinasse </PERSON>, a trader with <ORGANIZATION> Dean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Witter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reynolds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>.

 The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> are studying the books of 11 electric cooperatives and utilities with ties to the <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> accounting firm of <ORGANIZATION> Arthur </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Andersen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Co. The inquiry is focusing on possible tax violations and illegal accounting practices by <ORGANIZATION> Oglethorpe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, an Atlanta-based electric cooperative. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION>'s Southeast regional inspector general, said the government also is examining the role of <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Andersen </PERSON>, the nation's largest accounting firm and the auditor for all 11 cooperatives. <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> said that records from the companies were subpoenaed in June, but that the cooperatives were not necessarily targets of the federal probe at that time. All of the cooperatives are recipients of loans from the <ORGANIZATION> Rural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electrification </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, which is part of the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, he said. <LOCATION> Oglethorpe </LOCATION>, which is owned by and provides electricity to 39 of <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>'s 42 electric membership corporations, has been the target of both a civil and criminal investigation by the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> over its tax returns from 1980 through 1983. It also reported this year it was under investigation by the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION>, in a related probe, is investigating Atlanta-based <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, the utility holding company, and its subsidiaries, including the <ORGANIZATION> Georgia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, in connection with allegations that Southern defrauded the government of millions of dollars by improperly accounting for spare parts.

<HEAD>Subroto Calls For Revamped OPEC Production Policy</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Subroto as one word is correct</NOTE>
<DATELINE>KUWAIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> Secretary-General <PERSON> Subroto </PERSON> arrived in <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> Friday after visits to <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>, where he apparently failed to settle the problem of setting oil output levels for <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. In arrival statements, <PERSON> Subroto </PERSON> indicated that he saw a solution only through a revamped production policy for the entire 13-member Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries. <PERSON> Subroto </PERSON>'s talks in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> this week reportedly focused on the question of whether <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> should be allowed to increase its oil production quota to parity with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Kuwait </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> quoted him as saying it was `` necessary that <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> member states look into this problem -LRB- <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> output -RRB- within the framework of the basic issue from which <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> suffers ... overproduction by <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> member states beyond the 15.06 million barrels daily ceiling.'' <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> has refused to adhere to its quota of 1.54 million barrels a day, demanding parity with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s 2.369 million. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s unrestrained current output is estimated at 2.8 million barrels a day KUNA said <PERSON> Subroto </PERSON> indicated the Iraq-Iran production controversy `` can not be solved separately from the rest of the pending issues related to <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> production.'' Among the issues <PERSON> Subroto </PERSON> is discussing during his current tour of <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> nations is the production level of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Emirates </LOCATION>, which he visited on an earlier tour and which currently is estimated to be producing at least twice its allotted quota. The U.A.E. announced its quota should be 1.5 million barrels a day instead of its alloted 948,000. Since late 1986, the cartel has slashed its aggregate output by more than 3 million barrels per day to try to stabilize nosediving prices around an $ 18-a-barrel benchmark. But quota violations by member states has made the target price elusive. <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION>'s current output is about 20 million barrels although the official overall ceiling set by the cartel is 15.06 million, excluding <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> last week on his way to <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Subroto </PERSON> said he believed it was reasonable that <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> should have equal quotas of 2.3 million barrels a day. His statements to KUNA here confirmed he had made no headway so far. But he was quoted as saying `` we have not yet despaired and we still have a number of proposals in this connection.'' <PERSON> Subroto </PERSON> said he discussed with Iraqi and Iranian officials `` the future level of output for each of <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>,'' KUNA reported. He could not predict when a settlement was possible and said a single visit to each capital `` is difficult for reaching a solution.'' In <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION> earlier in the day, <PERSON> Subroto </PERSON> declined to comment to reporters on the result of his talks there. Iraqi officials described the talks as `` satisfactory.'' The official <ORGANIZATION> Iraqi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said only that <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s oil minister, <PERSON> Issam </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdul-Rahim </PERSON> <PERSON> al-Chalabi </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Subroto </PERSON> discussed recent developments in the oil market.

 A federal judge today dismissed two lawsuits seeking $ 3 billion from space shuttle rocket-maker <ORGANIZATION> Morton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Thiokol </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> by a former company engineer who warned against the ill-fated 1986 Challenger launch. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Winder </PERSON> granted <ORGANIZATION> Morton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Thiokol </ORGANIZATION>'s request for dismissal of the suits filed by <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Boisjoly </PERSON>, who left the company in July 1986, citing physical ailments and alleged mental torment Telephone calls to <PERSON> Boisjoly </PERSON>'s <PERSON> Willard </PERSON> home were not immediately returned. In his decision, <PERSON> Winder </PERSON> dismissed most counts in <PERSON> Boisjoly </PERSON>'s suits with prejudice, meaning they can not be refiled But the judge said he would dismiss two counts of one suit, which deal with allegations of defamation and conspiracy, without prejudice. In one suit, <PERSON> Boisjoly </PERSON> sought $ 1 billion for the deaths of the seven astronauts killed when Challenger exploded on Jan. 28, 1986, and $ 1 million in compensatory damages for <PERSON> Boisjoly </PERSON>'s health and career. <PERSON> Boisjoly </PERSON> claimed <PERSON> Morton </PERSON> <PERSON> Thiokol </PERSON> impugned his professional reputation after he and other engineers testified before a presidential commission investigating the disaster that they had warned against the launch. His other lawsuit, filed under the False Claims Act on behalf of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> taxpayers, sought $ 2.075 billion and alleged that <PERSON> Morton </PERSON> <PERSON> Thiokol </PERSON> knowingly provided <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> with defective solid rocket motors. <PERSON> Winder </PERSON> ruled that `` the ` conspiracy' alleged in the complaint is not of a nature to support an action for damages on the part of <PERSON> Boisjoly </PERSON>. ... Neither the conspiracy itself nor the overt acts allegedly done in furtherance of it were directed toward <PERSON> Boisjoly </PERSON>.'' The judge wrote that `` to suggest that the recommendation or the launch were acts directed toward and for the purpose of injuring <PERSON> Boisjoly </PERSON> is ridiculous.'' `` Furthermore, for a reasonable person to know that <PERSON> Boisjoly </PERSON> might suffer emotional injury as a result of the launch would include the requirement that the person know that the launch would end in disaster,'' <PERSON> Winder </PERSON> added. `` The dismissal of these two suits completely vindicates <ORGANIZATION> Morton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Thiokol </ORGANIZATION>,'' said <PERSON> Morton </PERSON> <PERSON> Thiokol </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Snow </PERSON>. `` We are very happy to have this situation behind us.'' Company attorneys had argued that <PERSON> Boisjoly </PERSON>'s contention that he was defamed was based on office chatter. `` It is just workplace-related talk that goes on all the time,'' attorney <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON> told the judge at a hearing in February. However, <PERSON> Boisjoly </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Levin </PERSON>, accused company officials of launching a campaign to defame the engineer through pamphlets and interviews. `` This is not a disgruntled person,'' <PERSON> Levin </PERSON> argued. `` This is an engineer who stood up and risked his career and hurt his health because he had this alternate view.'' In a May interview, <PERSON> Boisjoly </PERSON> said it was only after two years of therapy and `` the positive catharsis'' of lecturing on the disaster that he was able to stop blaming himself for the destruction of the shuttle and deaths of its astronauts. `` For a long time, I bore the burden of guilt because I had n't done more to stop it,'' he said `` But I've resolved it now. I did everything I could.'' <PERSON> Boisjoly </PERSON> and several other <ORGANIZATION> Morton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Thiokol </ORGANIZATION> engineers argued the night before the launch that temperatures of 53 degrees or less could cause a rocket joint seal to fail. But after a second caucus with <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> officials, <PERSON> Boisjoly </PERSON> said, company managers `` perceived pressure from <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION>. ... There was no other justification for the launch. I felt the pressure, others felt the pressure.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Rogers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, which investigated the disaster, blamed the tragedy on a leaking joint seal that allowed superhot gases to escape and ignite the shuttle's external fuel tank. Investigators said the cold had weakened the seal. <PERSON> Boisjoly </PERSON> took disability leave in July 1986, and left the company for good two months later. This year, he won the Scientific Freedom and Responsibility Award from the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advancement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION>.

 The stock and bond markets rallied powerfully today after the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> unemployment rate rose to 5.6 percent in August, a figure that eased concerns the economy was growing too briskly. The news that more Americans were out of work cheered up investors who were worried that the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> would have to raise interest rates to stave off inflation. Bond prices staged their biggest rally of the year, driving yields back down to the levels of early August. The yield on the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION>'s benchmark 30-year bond plunged to 9.03 percent from 9.30 percent late Thursday. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones average of 30 industrials jumped 53.34 points to 2,055.65 by 1:30 p.m. EDT. The Dow Jones average's rise triggered a <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> prohibition on member firms' use of <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION> automated systems to perform a form of program trading known as index arbitrage. The prohibition kicks in when the index rises or falls more than 50 points. The dollar fell slightly against most major currencies as investors decided that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> interest rates would drop and make dollar-denominated securities less attractive to global investors. The <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said the number of jobless Americans jumped by 226,000 in August to 6,851,000, as four months of hiring booms in factories and retail stores screeched to a halt. The August figure was 0.2 percentage point higher than July's civilian jobless rate of 5.4 percent, which was up 0.1 percent from June's 14-year low of 5.3 percent A separate survey of business payrolls, which many economists consider a more reliable indicator of the economy's health, showed 219,000 new jobs in August, well below the 400,000 average monthly increase in June and July. Today's unemployment data followed another government report showing the first quarterly decline in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> labor productivity since 1986. Analysts said the report indicated that hard-pressed businesses were being forced to hire less-skilled workers to fill job openings. The <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday that the labor productivity of non-farm businesses fell 1.4 percent in the April-June period, less than the originally reported 1.7 percent decline. The report was roughly in line with expectations and did not have a large effect on the financial markets. Stock prices fell Thursday in sympathy with previous declines in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dropped 29.34 points to 2,002.31. Other reports Thursday took some of the edge off fears of inflation and rising interest rates. August sales figures indicated the nation's largest general retailers were unable to escape their 18-month-old slump as weather and continuing problems in apparel lines kept customers away. Also, the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said construction spending rose 1.2 percent in July after slumping in June. On productivity, the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> released revised figures showing productivity fell at an annual rate of 1.4 percent in the April-June period. The statistic measures the output per hour of labor for non-farm businesses. Labor costs shot up at a 5.7 percent annual rate _ the biggest increase since 1986 _ reflecting the productivity declines and wage and benefit increases averaging 4.2 percent annually. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Renfro </PERSON> of Alphametrics, an economic forecasting firm in <PERSON> Bala </PERSON> <PERSON> Cynwyd </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, said the figures indicate that an `` inflationary head of steam is building.'' Economic output in the second quarter rose 3.3 percent, but to achieve the increased output, businesses had to raise the number of hours worked by their employees by 6.6 percent. Analysts said the increase in hours and consequent decrease in productivity reflects a hiring boom in which employers at a time of decade-low unemployment are relying more on less-skilled workers.

 The dollar fell against major currencies in European trading Friday after the announcement of slightly higher-than-expected <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> August unemployment data. Gold prices also fell. Foreign exchange dealers said the dollar dropped sharply against the West German mark after the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s announcement that the unemployment rate had risen to 5.6 percent from 5.4 percent in July. Most traders had expected the unemployment rate to have remained at about the same levels as July, they said. One trader at a German bank in <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> said the unemployment data accelerated an already noticeable downward trend in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> currency because the data suggested the American economy is slowing down, dampening expectations that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would increase interest rates in the near future. However, trading generally was quiet Friday, with many market participants confused about the market outlook and unwilling to take positions before the upcoming three-day Labor Day weekend in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, where trading ends before <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s business day begins, the dollar rose 0.05 yen to a closing 136.75 yen. Later, in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, it was quoted at 137.65 yen. Other late dollar rates, compared with late Thursday: 1.8665 West German marks, down from 1.8795 1.5725 Swiss francs, down from 1.5835; 6.3365 French francs, down from 6.3780; 2.1050 Dutch guilders, down from 2.1205; 1,388.50 Italian lire, down from 1,398.50; 1.2362 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2370. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, the British pound fetched $ 1.6755, compared with $ 1.6730 Thursday. Gold opened in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> at a bid price of $ 429.40 a troy ounce and at midmorning the city's five major bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of $ 428.95.

 The nation's unemployment rate rose to 5.6 percent in August as four months of hiring booms on factory assembly lines and in retail stores came to an abrupt halt, the government said today. The <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said the number of jobless Americans jumped by 226,000 to 6,851,000 in August while the number of those with jobs rose by only 121,000 to 115,180,000. The 0.2 percentage point increase from July's civilian jobless rate of 5.4 percent followed a 0.1 percent rise from June's 14-year low of 5.3 percent. The report sparked a rally on Wall Street. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks climbed sharply in early trading as investors apparently viewed the unemployment rise as reducing upward pressure on interest rates and inflation. Most of the increased joblessness was suffered by adult men, with their unemployment rate rising 0.4 percentage points to 4.9 percent. The jobless rate among adult women, meanwhile, fell from 5.1 percent to 4.8 percent, the A separate survey of business payrolls _ which many economists consider a more reliable indicator of the economy's health _ showed 219,000 new jobs in August, well below the 400,000 average monthly increase in June and July.

 <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said. White House spokesman <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON>, in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> with the vacationing president, called the report `` good news.'' `` The continued strong gains in August payroll employment confirm that the longest peacetime expansion in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> history continued through its 69th month,'' the spokesman said. Despite the increase in unemployment, <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> said the administration was cheered by `` the good numbers underneath the overall numbers,'' such as in the jobless rate for women. The last time the civilian unemployment rate was at 5.6 percent was in May. The goods-producing side of the economy lost jobs for the first time since last January, with employment in manufacturing dropping by 5,000 after a 70,000 jump in July. The <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said small employment gains in printing and publishing and export-related industries such as machinery and electrical equipment were more than offset by 9,000 job losses in textile and apparel plants and smaller declines in several other manufacturing industries. Employment in oil and gas drilling also declined slightly, but it rose a minuscule 3,000 jobs in construction. On the services side of the economy, large monthly increases in retail trade hiring _ 80,000 in July alone _ slowed to just 23,000 new jobs last month, virtually all in grocery stores. Other recent high-growth job areas also slowed. Business services such as temporary help firms added just 16,000 new workers, compared with average monthly increases of 60,000 through the spring and early summer. New employment in health services, which the government predicts will be the largest area of job growth in the 1990s as the Baby Boom population ages, slowed to 22,000 in August. It also had been rising an average 30,000 a month in the past year. `` The labor market showed less strength in August than earlier in the year,'' said Labor Statistics Commissioner <PERSON> Janet </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Norwood </PERSON>. `` Looked at over a somewhat longer period, however, the rate has hovered in the 5.3 percent to 5.6 percent range since last March and is 0.4 percentage point below the leval a year ago.'' Ms. <PERSON> Norwood </PERSON> said one encouraging sign was that the number of people working part-time involuntarily because they could not find full-time jobs `` returned to the bottom of the 5.2 million to 5.6 million range within which it has been fluctuating for more than a year.'' `` The proportion of working-age persons holding jobs remained at its record level of 62.3 percent,'' Ms. <PERSON> Norwood </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. Other data in the report, however, suggested that the economy might be slowing. The average workweek declined by 20 minutes to 34.6 hours and manufacturing overtime fell by 0.1 hours to 3.8 hours a week on average. That sent weekly earnings down nearly a full percentage point as average hourly wages for non-supervisory workers held steady at $ 9.24. In the past 12 months, the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said, wages have risen an average of only 3.1 percent, decreasing the buying power of workers, after taking inflation into account, by half a percent. A separate calculation that includes the 1.7 million uniformed armed forces in the job market showed a jobless rate of 5.5 percent last month, up from 5.4 percent in July. The government offered this other figures on unemployment in August: Whites, 4.9 percent, up from 4.7 percent in July. Blacks, 11.3 percent, down from 11.4 percent. Hispanics, 8.4 percent, up from 8 percent. Teen-agers, 15.8 percent, up from 15.2 percent. Black teen-gers, 15.8 percent, up from 15.2 percent. Private analysts had anticipated the overall jobless rate might rise prior to today's report. `` I think we're going to be stuck near 5.5 percent for the rest of the year,'' said <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Brinner </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> Lexington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, economic consulting firm. `` Employment is not going to fall; it's just not going to rise as fast as it has been.'' <PERSON> Brinner </PERSON>, like other economists, believes too many people, many of them with only marginal skills, have been hired in recent months in relation to the rate of economic growth. `` We may be at the point where we have absorbed most of labor's skilled capacity,'' said <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Renfro </PERSON>, chief economist for the forecasting firm of <ORGANIZATION> Alphametrics </ORGANIZATION>, also of <PERSON> Bala </PERSON> <PERSON> Cynwyd </PERSON> `` Anything less than an uptick in the jobless rate will be a real danger sign that the economy is overheating.'' <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON>, an economist for <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION>, noted that new claims for unemployment compensation rose slightly last month, an indication of increased layoffs in some areas. <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> believes there is still room for the jobless rate to fall over the next several months, `` but not in August.''

 <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>'s economy minister resigned Friday, three months after taking office, following a government report that showed inflation soared a record 243 percent during the first eight months of the year. President <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> immediately appointed a new economy minister, <PERSON> Abel </PERSON> <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON>, to fill the post vacated by <PERSON> Cesar </PERSON> <PERSON> Robles </PERSON>, the official gazette <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peruano </ORGANIZATION> said. Analysts said <PERSON> Robles </PERSON>' resignation was expected after disagreements arose in the Cabinet of Ministers over how to reactivate the nation's recession-ridden economy. <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON>, current energy minister and former interior minister, was expected to move quickly to combat inflation with another round of austerity measures, analysts said. <PERSON> Jorge </PERSON> <PERSON> Carrasco </PERSON>, a congressional deputy and president of the <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deputies </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, is to head the energy ministry, the gazette said. <PERSON> Robles </PERSON>, the third economy minister in <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON>'s center-left government, assumed his post just three months ago as a recession deepened and inflation skyrocketed. According to the government report, manufacturing has continued to decline, shortages of basic consumer products are widespread and the cost of living rose 30.9 percent in July, the highest single month total in Peruvian history. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Statistics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> said in a gazette communique Friday that August consumer prices increased 21.7 percent over the July level, and 243 percent from January through August.

 An executive of <ORGANIZATION> Reebok </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>, an athletic footwear company based in <LOCATION> Canton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, settled insider trading charges Friday by agreeing to surrender profits and pay a penalty.

<HEAD>Stock Index Futures, an American Invention, Debuts in Japan</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Saturday in lead graf is correct.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Trading of stock-index futures began Saturday in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, theoretically giving investors a new opportunity to protect themselves if and when the big rally in the world's largest securities market ends. Although stock-index futures have been blamed by some critics for playing a significant role in the October stock market crash in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, there seems to be little concern the same thing could happen here, partly because of what strategists called <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s penchant for caution. `` The Japanese are a very wise people,'' said <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, an Asian-Pacific futures specialist at <ORGANIZATION> Citicorp </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Scrimgeour </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Vickers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION> `` They like to acclimatize themselves properly before doing anything. Going off the board is n't their way of life. Their way of life is to do all their homework very carefully and make sure it works.'' A distinctly American financial invention that the Japanese have been eying for years, stock index futures are obligations to buy or sell the equivalent cash value of a group of stocks at a set price on a set date. Purchased for only a small fraction of their total worth, index futures theoretically enable investors to bet on the overall direction of the stock market. Index futures can serve as hedging mechanisms against a market drop or an inexpensive way to speculate on a market advance. Their eagerly awaited premiere in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> comes at a particularly opportune time, because <LOCATION> Japanese </LOCATION> stock prices have been trading near their record highs. There has been increasing concern over how long the rally will last, and investors have been looking for ways to protect themselves in a decline. The debut of index futures in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> also coincides with simmering controversy in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> on the impact of such financial strategies. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> critics say index futures encourage reckless speculation and conflict with the kind of long-term investing in individual stocks that is essential for healthy markets. Moreover, the critics contend, the development of high-speed computerized trading of index futures and the stocks that comprise them in order to profit from price differences, a technique called index arbitrage, has injected frightening volatility into the markets and discouraged would-be investors. Some studies have blamed index arbitrage for aggravating the Oct. 19 collapse of stock prices in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trading, the most popular index futures are based on the <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Poor's 500-stock index, and the Major Market Index, a measurement of 20 stocks that closely tracks the more widely known Dow Jones Industrial Average. The Japanese concocted their index futures based on the Nikkei Index of 225 Selected Issues, which began trading Saturday on the <ORGANIZATION> Osaka </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, and the <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Price </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Index </ORGANIZATION>, called <ORGANIZATION> Topix </ORGANIZATION>, which began trading on the <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. Japanese market professionals said trading began slowly, reflecting an underlying cautious approach. They said it would probably take a few years for the Japanese to develop profitable index arbitrage computerized strategies, and in the meantime the impact on stock prices likely would be small. Part of the problem in developing such strategies, they said, is that some stocks represented in the Nikkei or Topix indexes can not be traded via computer, which makes complicated arbitrage strategies difficult. In addition, Japanese stock markets are protected from wild swings by the daily limits placed on individual shares, another potential obstacle to profitable arbitrage between stocks and index futures. Both the Nikkei and <ORGANIZATION> Topix </ORGANIZATION> contracts will have a limit of 3 percent for a single day of trade, although if the market is orderly then exchange officials have the power to allow continued trading. `` Of course when volume builds up over time, the futures will become another factor affecting stocks,'' said a futures trader at <ORGANIZATION> Salomon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> office, who asked not to be identified by name. `` But I do n't think there will be all that much speculative interest.''

<HEAD>Travel Agents Claim Delta Practices Unfair</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SALT LAKE CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A coalition of 24 travel agencies in <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> has taken legal action in an effort to combat what it claims are unfair trade and pricing practices by <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lines </ORGANIZATION>. The group, called the <ORGANIZATION> Independent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Travel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION>, contends that <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> has entered into exclusive marketing arrangements with <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>'s three largest travel agencies, placing members of the alliance at a competitive disadvantage. The <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> marketing agreements, according to the coalition, allow the three big travel agencies _ <ORGANIZATION> Murdock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Travel </ORGANIZATION>, Morris-Ask Mr. <PERSON> Foster </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Beehive-Bonneville </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Travel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> _ to offer special `` bulk fares'' or `` tour-based fares.'' Bulk or tour-based fares, which airlines have designed for the leisure travel market, do not require advance booking by travelers and represent a significant reduction from airlines' standard fares. The special fares include round-trip air travel and, in some instances, either a car rental or hotel accommodations. Alliance members claim they are not allowed to offer the special fares to their customers and as a result have lost substantial business. Attorney <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Giauque </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Salt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> said a complaint was filed Thursday with the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> on behalf of the 24 <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> travel agencies. He said the complaint seeks an order barring Atlanta-based Delta from offering the special travel arrangements or compelling the airline to make them available to all travel agents. <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Kolakowski </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION>'s assistant vice president of sales, said the bulk fares are designed for the leisure travel market and not the business travel market. `` We've been offering these fares across our system,'' he said. `` The fares are part of a tour package which can include mandatory car rental or a minimum stay in a hotel.'' But alliance members contend that <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>'s big three travel agencies are aggressively advertising and promoting the special fares to corporate clients.

 For <ORGANIZATION> Minnetonka </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, there may be only one `` Obsession.'' But now the company hopes to extend its success in the personal fragrance business into `` Eternity.'' <LOCATION> Minnetonka </LOCATION> is spending about $ 18 million to launch Eternity, another <PERSON> Calvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Klein </PERSON> fragrance that the company says will appeal to a growing set of Americans interested in true romance and lasting love. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>, founder and chairman of Bloomington-based <ORGANIZATION> Minnetonka </ORGANIZATION>, said he expects the new, floral scent to be as popular as its steamier predecessor, Obsession. `` Obsession stands for the'60s and'70s of the sexual revolution. It's warm and sensual,'' <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> said. `` I think Eternity stands for love, romance and commitment.'' Regardless of the values they espouse, both perfumes have the smell of money. Obsession is the sales leader at <ORGANIZATION> Calvin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Klein </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cosmetics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, the subsidiary that accounted for an estimated $ 105 million of <LOCATION> Minnetonka </LOCATION>'s 1987 sales of $ 152.4 million, said <PERSON> Marsha </PERSON> <PERSON> Raley </PERSON>, a stock analyst for <ORGANIZATION> Dain </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bosworth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION>. `` We think Eternity will be as big as Obsession,'' <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> said. Largely on the continued strength of Obsession sales, <LOCATION> Minnetonka </LOCATION> is expected to record net income in 1988 of about $ 15.5 million, or 95 cents a share, <PERSON> Raley </PERSON> said. That compares with net income of $ 10.1 million, or 57 cents a share, in 1987, not counting the after-tax gain of $ 65 million on the sale of Softsoap to <ORGANIZATION> Colgate-Palmolive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> `` They're very creative,'' <PERSON> Raley </PERSON> said. `` They're good at identifying mass psychology trends. `` If you read the public right and you simplify what the public wants and you color it the way you think they want it colored then you end up striking a successful chord,'' <PERSON> Raley </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Delsing </PERSON>, executive vice president of <ORGANIZATION> Calvin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Klein </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cosmetics </ORGANIZATION>, credit the fashion designer for attaching significance to Eternity. <PERSON> Klein </PERSON> is settling down after undergoing treatment for an addiction to vodka and valium and his life mirrors the message of Eternity, <PERSON> Delsing </PERSON> said. In fact, the fragrance got its name from an inscription on a ring purchased by <PERSON> Klein </PERSON> about a year ago for his wife. He bought the ring from a Duke of <LOCATION> Windsor </LOCATION> collection. `` Everything about Eternity so epitomizes his new lifestyle,'' <PERSON> Delsing </PERSON> said. But Eternity was n't designed in `` random creative'' fashion, <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> said. Instead, <LOCATION> Minnetonka </LOCATION> identified a niche in the perfume market opposite Obsession and screened the samples that <PERSON> Klein </PERSON> chose from. `` It's more of a directed creative approach,'' <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> said. `` We did n't want to cannibalize Obsession.'' <LOCATION> Minnetonka </LOCATION> has hopes that both fragrances will prove to be classics. Channel No. 5, for instance, has survived for 65 years. <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>, whose company acquired <ORGANIZATION> Calvin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Klein </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cosmetics </ORGANIZATION> in 1981, said he'll keep Obsession and Eternity alive by restricting distribution to about 700 stores. At $ 185 an ounce _ $ 10 more than Obsession _ Eternity is decidedly upscale and gets prime display space, he said. `` We do n't do anything unless it's prime,'' <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> said. Eternity made its debut from June through August at two <ORGANIZATION> Saks </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fifth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Avenue </ORGANIZATION> stores in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Its national launch officially began this week, but <PERSON> Dayton </PERSON> <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON> department stores have been selling it since the first weekend in August, said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON>, a senior buyer of fine fragrances for Minneapolis-based <PERSON> Dayton </PERSON> <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON> `` It's been tremendously successful,'' <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON> said. `` We had customers literally grabbing four or five bottles off the first cart as it was being unpacked.'' <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> said Eternity has been his company's chief focus for the past year. Next year an Eternity for men will be developed and <ORGANIZATION> Calvin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Klein </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cosmetics </ORGANIZATION> will introduce a line of dressing accessories such as belts, purses and cosmetic bags. Meanwhile, <PERSON> Calvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Klein </PERSON> continues to hold about 12 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Minnetonka </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> stock, which has been selling in the range of $ 16 a share. <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> said <PERSON> Klein </PERSON> has no intention of seeking a controlling interest in the company.

 The soft drink makers are recruiting some tough characters for commercials designed to convince men that it's okay to drink diet colas. This summer it was boxer <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Tyson </PERSON> in commercials for Diet Pepsi. This fall, it will be a few dozen pro football players for <ORGANIZATION> Diet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coke </ORGANIZATION>. It's a new approach for sugarless sodas, a majority of which have traditionally been consumed by women. A decade ago, the soft drink makers say, women consumed about 75 percent of the diet soft drinks purchased. Atlanta-based <ORGANIZATION> Coca-Cola </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION> said that percentage has since fallen to about 65 percent. Nonetheless, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Beindorff </PERSON>, vice president of advertising for <ORGANIZATION> Coca-Cola </ORGANIZATION>, said a big block of men remains `` averse to diet soft drinks.'' He hopes to change that attitude with a campaign that begins Monday, and will eventually feature players from every <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Football </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> team in local print and broadcast ads for diet <ORGANIZATION> Coke </ORGANIZATION>. The first commercial airs during the season's first Monday Night Football telecast on <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> matching the <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Redskins </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Giants </ORGANIZATION>. In the ad, <ORGANIZATION> Redskins </ORGANIZATION> linemen <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Mann </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Butz </PERSON> toss a quarterback rather than a coin to decide who gets the last Diet <ORGANIZATION> Coke </ORGANIZATION> during practice. Additional ads will appear locally during the season. In some cases, players will appear in versions of an ad adapted for local use. For instance, <PERSON> Beindorff </PERSON> said one local ad will show three players from a team with a tiger, a bear or some other team symbol. As the camera pans over them, the announcer will say `` three out of four -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Bengals </ORGANIZATION> or Bears or whatever -RRB- prefer'' Diet <ORGANIZATION> Coke </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Meyers </PERSON>, publisher of <ORGANIZATION> Beverage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Digest </ORGANIZATION>, a trade publication based in <LOCATION> Greenwich </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, said soft drink sales rose about 4 percent last year to $ 40 billion, but that the diet segment has been growing four to five times faster. His 1987 beverage rankings listed Diet <ORGANIZATION> Coke </ORGANIZATION> as the third best selling soft drink behind Coca-Cola Classic and <ORGANIZATION> Pepsi </ORGANIZATION> with 7.7 percent of the market, and <ORGANIZATION> Diet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pepsi </ORGANIZATION> fourth with 4.8 percent. <PERSON> Meyers </PERSON> gives <ORGANIZATION> Pepsi </ORGANIZATION> `` high marks for clearly identifying the male image'' with its ads that featured <PERSON> Tyson </PERSON>, who defended his heavyweight title and said <PERSON> Diet </PERSON> <PERSON> Pepsi </PERSON> did too in taste tests against Diet <ORGANIZATION> Coke </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Beindorff </PERSON> said the new diet <ORGANIZATION> Coke </ORGANIZATION> ads were in development long before the Tyson ads ran. While he would not disclose how much they cost, he said the fees for all the football players will come to only a fraction of the $ 1.25 million he said <ORGANIZATION> Pepsi </ORGANIZATION> reportedly paid <PERSON> Tyson </PERSON>.

 The stock market rolled up its sharpest gain in more than three months Friday, inspired by new statistics on employment that suggested a slowing of economic growth. Falling interest rates in an enthusiastic bond market helped to keep the rally going. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials jumped 52.28 to 2,054.59 for its biggest one-day advance since it rose 74.68 points on May 31. The average finished the week with a net gain of 37.16 points. Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 4 to 1 in nationwide trading of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> Exchange-listed stocks, with 1,197 up, 296 down and 439 unchanged. Volume on the floor of the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> came to 159.84 million shares, up from 144.09 million in the previous session. Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter market, totaled 183.57 million shares. Before the opening, the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> reported that the unemployment rate rose to 5.6 percent in August from 5.4 percent the month before.

The figures got a rousing welcome in the bond market. Prices of long-term government bonds, which move in the opposite direction from interest rates, climbed more than $ 20 for each $ 1,000 in face value. Analysts said it was also a healthy sign that stock trading volume stepped up to its highest level in more than two weeks, even with many traders presumably getting an early start on the long Labor Day weekend. All 30 of the stocks that make up the Dow Jones industrial average posted gains. Among actively traded blue chips, <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> gained 1 \ to 29 -LRB-; <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machines </ORGANIZATION> 3 -RCB- to 114; <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> 1 to 46 ~; <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> 1 to 40 ~, and <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Telegraph | <ORGANIZATION> Redman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> jumped 1 -RCB- to 10.

 A report that more Americans were out of work triggered a powerful rally on Wall Street Friday as investors figured a slowdown meant less inflation and lower interest rates. The government's report of a rise in the civilian jobless rate to 5.6 percent in August helped calm a market that has been worried for months that the economy was growing too quickly and might go into an inflationary spiral. `` It's bad news, I guess, for job searchers, but it's not necessarily bad news for consumers in general,'' said <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Iwanicki </PERSON>, an associate economist for <ORGANIZATION> Kidder </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peabody </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Co.. Stock prices leaped and the <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jones </ORGANIZATION> average of 30 industrial stocks rose 52.28 points to 2,054.59, its biggest rise since a 74.68-point gain on May 31 The rise of more than 50 points triggered a restriction on member firms' use of computers for a form of program trading. The collar is designed to avoid chaotic swings in stock prices. Friday's rally began in the bond market, which staged its biggest rally since Oct. 22, the aftermath of the stock market crash, according to an index of all outstanding Treasury issues maintained by <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION>'s closely watched 30-year bond staged its second-biggest rally of the year. The price of the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION>'s 30-year bond briefly rose almost $ 30 for every $ 1,000 in face value Late in the day, the long bond's price was up about $ 25.90, driving its yield down to 9.04 from 9.30 percent late Thursday. The only bigger rally of 1988 was a $ 26.25 price increase on Jan. 15, after the government reported a big drop in the trade deficit. The bond market is highly sensitive to inflation and takes weaker growth as good news. When bond prices rose, investors moved to the stock market in search of bargains. For stock investors, the higher jobless rate was good news because it seemed to lessen the likelihood that the economy was in the late stages of an inflationary boom that would end up with a bust, said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>, a market analyst at <ORGANIZATION> Prudential-Bache </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. In the long run, a slight increase in joblessness could mean more stable, prolonged growth, <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> said. In spite of the uptick in the jobless rate, from 5.4 percent in July and a 14-year low of 5.3 percent in May, the economy continues to be expanding and the nation is not far from full employment, <PERSON> Iwanicki </PERSON> said. `` Fundamentally, the economy is quite strong,'' said <PERSON> Helen </PERSON> <PERSON> Hotchkiss </PERSON>, a senior economist at <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. Analysts said the slight increase in the jobless rate eases pressure on the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> to raise interest rates to cool down the economy In particular, it reduces the probability that the central bank will move before the election to raise its discount rate, which it charges on loans to banks. The number of jobless Americans grew by 226,000 in August and a four-month hiring boom in the nation's factories ended abruptly, the government said. A separate survey of business payrolls showed employers adding 219,000 new jobs in August, compared with average monthly gains of more than 325,000 the previous three months. Despite the increase in the unemployment rate, the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said a record 62.3 percent of the working-age population 16 and over held jobs in August. Average hourly wages for non-supervisory workers held steady at $ 9.24.

 Money traders dumped dollars in a hectic selloff and sharply depressed the currency Friday after a surprising <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> unemployment report that showed the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economy may be slowing down. Gold prices eased. <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> quoted bullion at $ 429 a troy ounce as of 4 p.m. EDT, down from $ 429.75 late Thursday. Currency brokers said the foreign-exchange market was stunned by the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s report, which showed an unexpectedly big rise in unemployment figures last month, from 5.4 percent of the workforce to 5.6 percent. Contrary to earlier evidence about the economy, the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> report implied that growth is easing, thereby relieving inflation pressure and lessening the prospect of higher interest rates. Many currency traders have been assuming that as a consequence of a growing economy, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> interest rates must rise, which would make dollars more valuable. `` The unemployment number was n't taken very well at all, to say the least,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, chief currency dealer at the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> office of <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Julius </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Baer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, a Swiss banking concern. `` People got a little panicked about holding dollars.'' Currency strategists said that if the next series of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economic reports provides more evidence of a slowdown, then the dollar's appreciation over the last four months could erode dramatically. In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, where trading ended before the release of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> unemployment figures, the dollar rose 0.05 yen to a closing 136.75 yen. Later in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, it was quoted at 137.65 yen. By the time trading concluded in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, the dollar had fallen to 135.97 yen, down from 136.27 yen late Thursday. The British pound fetched $ 1.6755, slightly higher than its $ 1.6730 exchange rate Thursday. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, the pound strengthened further to $ 1.6850, up from $ 1.6693 late Thursday. Other late-dollar rates in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> compared with levels late Thursday included: 1.8524 West German marks, down from 1.8730; 1.5567 Swiss frrancs, down from 1.5787; 1.2355 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2363; 6.2915 French francs, down from 6.3670; 1,381.50 Italian lire, down from 1,393.75. Late dollar rates in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> compared with Thursday: 1.8665 marks, down from 1.8795 1.5725 Swiss francs, down from 1.5835; 6.3365 French francs, down from 6.3780; 2.1050 Dutch guilders, down from 2.1205; 1,388.50 Italian lire, down from 1,398.50; 1.2362 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2370. On the Commodity Exchange in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, gold for current delivery fell 90 cents a troy ounce to $ 429.30. Earlier in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, gold closed at $ 427.50, down from $ 430.70 Thursday; in <LOCATION> Zurich </LOCATION> it fell $ 2.50 to $ 428; and in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> it fell $ 1.26 to $ 431.35. Silver was quoted at $ 6.52 a troy ounce in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, down from $ 6.58 Thursday. On the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Comex </LOCATION>, silver for current delivery fell 5.6 cents to $ 6.518.

<HEAD>Bond Market Posts Biggest Gain Of Year</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bond market posted its biggest gain of the year and interest rates tumbled Friday as a new report on employment in August indicated the pace of economic growth may be slowing. The report defused concerns, at least for the time being, that the economy may be growing so fast that it could ignite inflation, which eats away at the value of fixed-income investments such as <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> notes and bonds. Slower growth is a plus for bond prices because credit demands and price pressures are usually lower in such periods and interest rates can fall. The <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> Bond Index, which measures price movements on all outstanding <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> issues with maturities of a year or longer, climbed 12.24 points to 1,142.50. That was the biggest rise since a 15.00-point advance on Oct. 22, 1987 when the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> was standing ready to provide liquidity to the financial system in the wake of the stock market crash. The biggest rise in the composite index this year had previously been a 12.05-point increase on Jan. 15. The <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION>'s 30-year bond climbed nearly 2 | points, or about $ 26 for every $ 1,000 in face amount That was slightly below the $ 26.25 rise on Jan. 15, when the market was cheered by a narrowing of the nation's trade deficit. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from its price, skidded to 9.04 percent from 9.30 percent late Thursday. That was its lowest since it finished at 9.03 percent on Aug. 4. The bond rally was sparked by the government's report that the nation's unemployment rate rose to 5.6 percent in August from 5.4 percent in July. A companion report on business payrolls said there were 219,000 new jobs in August, and revised downward the payroll growth previously reported for July. In addition, the report indicated a decline in hours worked and only a slight increase in average hourly earnings index for August. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, director of money market research for <ORGANIZATION> Dean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Witter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reynolds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, said the report `` allays the market's fears that the economy was moving into an overheated phase. He said the pace of trading was moderate, a pickup from the slow pace that has preceded release of the report. <PERSON> Elliott </PERSON> <PERSON> Platt </PERSON>, director of fixed-income research at <ORGANIZATION> Donaldson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lufkin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Jenrette </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, said, `` It was one of the most broadly-based, good reports we have seen in a long time.'' <PERSON> Sung </PERSON> <PERSON> Won </PERSON> <PERSON> Sohn </PERSON>, chief economist for <ORGANIZATION> Norwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION>, said the report means `` there is virtually no chance that the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> will tighten in the near future'' since the economy appears weaker than some presumed it was. <PERSON> Platt </PERSON> said the report may mark a turning point for trends in longterm rates, but <PERSON> Sohn </PERSON> said he expects rates will head higher later this year. In the secondary market for <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bonds, prices of short-term government issues rose by between -LCB- point and -RCB- point, intermediate maturities were up by between a full point and 1 -LCB- points and 20-year issues were up 2 -LCB- points, according to <ORGANIZATION> Telerate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a financial information service. The movement of a point is equivalent to a change of $ 10 in the price of a bond with a $ 1,000 face value. In corporate trading, prices rose. <ORGANIZATION> Moody </ORGANIZATION>'s Investment Grade Corporate Bond Index, which measures price movements on 80 corporate bonds with maturities of five years or longer, rose 3.34 to 287.76. Yields on three-month <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bills, meanwhile, fell to 7.42 percent as the discount fell 8 basis points to 7.20 percent. Yields on six-month bills fell to 7.78 percent as the discount fell 8 basis points to 7.40 percent. Yields on one-year bills fell to 8.04 percent as the discount fell 16 basis points to 7.50 percent. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. The yield is the annualized return on an investment in a <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bill. The discount is the percentage that bills are selling below the face value, which is paid at maturity. The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between banks, was quoted at 8 3-16 percent, down from 8 \ percent late Thursday

<HEAD>Bond Futures Soar On Jobless Report</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bond futures prices soared Friday on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> as news of a rise in the nation's unemployment rate eased inflation fears. On other markets, stock-index futures surged; precious metals futures fell; energy futures dropped sharply; grains and soybeans advanced; and livestock and meat futures were mixed. The <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s report that the jobless rate rose to 5.6 percent in August was good news to bond futures traders who had been worried the economy was expanding too quickly. But even more welcome was the news that the average hourly earnings index, a measure of wages, rose just 0.1 percent last month after gaining 0.4 percent in July, said <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Kahan </PERSON>, an economist with <ORGANIZATION> Kleinwort </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Benson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Government </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. `` The market was saying to itself, ` Hey, look, the unemployment rate is going down, yet the economy is strong and the cost of labor has not accelerated all that much,''' <PERSON> Kahan </PERSON> said. `` So they decided ... inflation was not accelerating as much as was feared heretofore.'' The contract for December delivery of the <ORGANIZATION> U. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bond rose 2 3-32 points to 87 19-32. On cash markets, the yield on the benchmark 30-year bond dropped to 9.14 percent from 9.30 percent. Stock-index futures also soared in reaction to the jobless rate. On the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, the contract for September delivery of the <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Poor's 500 index finished 6.80 points higher at 265.60. Precious-metals futures initially plunged on the unemployment news, with platinum down nearly $ 19 a troy ounce at midday. Precious metals, commonly seen as an investment hedge against inflation, tend to rise and fall with inflationary expectations. Friday's sharply lower crude oil prices added to the bearish tone in the metals markets, analysts said. But precious metals prices recovered late in the session to close only modestly lower. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Cardillo </PERSON>, commodities trading adviser with <ORGANIZATION> Josephthal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, said the metals markets remained technically weak despite the comeback. On the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, platinum settled $ 7.90 to $ 8.20 lower with October at $ 523.50 a troy ounce. On <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s Commodity Exchange, gold settled 90 cents to $ 2.70 lower with October at $ 431.80 a troy ounce; silver was 5.6 cents to 8 cents lower with September at $ 6.518 a troy ounce Energy futures prices settled sharply lower on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, capping a bearish week brought on by reports of more <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> overproduction. Crude oil for October delivery slid to a seven-week low, breaking a key support level of $ 15.10 a barrel and dragging other contract months down. Contracts for refined petroleum products also finished down sharply. Analysts linked the week's decline to reports that some members of the <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exporting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Countries </ORGANIZATION> were continuing to ignore production quotas, increasing the world's oil supply and further weakening prices. West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 29 cents to 33 cents lower with October at $ 14.79 a barrel; heating oil was .40 cent to .58 cent lower with October at 42.88 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was .38 cent to .73 cent lower with October at 43.98 cents a gallon. Grain and soybean futures finished mostly higher on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> in a late surge fueled by technical factors in the absence of new supply-and-demand developments. After the close, the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> announced sales of 800,000 metric tons of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> corn to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. Rumors of a large corn sale to the Soviets had boosted corn futures prices earlier in the week. Wheat settled -RCB- cent to 4 cents higher with September at $ 4.01 a bushel; corn was unchanged to 1 -LCB- cents higher with September at $ 2.90 -LCB- a bushel; oats were -RCB- cent lower to -LCB- cent higher with September at $ 2.59 -LCB- a bushel; soybeans were 1 -LCB- cents lower to 7 -LCB- cents higher with September at $ 8.73 a bushel. Cattle futures posted strong gains in a late surge of pre-weekend position squaring on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. Pork futures retreated on fears of slackening demand. Live cattle settled .20 cent to .90 cent higher with October at 72 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .10 cent to .83 cent higher with September at 81.35 cents a pound; hogs were .10 cent to .45 cent lower with October at 38.52 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were .42 cent to .82 cent lower with February at 48.65 cents a pound.

<HEAD>Big Board Reallocates Four Stocks in Disciplinary Move</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> said Friday that it has removed the rights of two specialist firms to make markets in four stocks following inquiries into their conduct during the October crash and its aftermath. The disciplinary move by the nation's biggest stock market against the firms, <ORGANIZATION> Stern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> and Spear, <ORGANIZATION> Leeds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Kellogg </PERSON>, brought to 11 the number of stocks that have been reallocated from <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION> specialists because of probes into how well they handled the panicky buying and selling during the crash. In the <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION> system for stock trading, 54 specialist firms control the rights to market certain stocks and are required to keep order by setting opening prices and covering trades using their own money when there are too few buyers or sellers. Specialist monopoly rights on stocks are considered extremely valuable because the firms get the great majority of business in those stocks. Removal of those rights by the <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION> is considered a significant punitive measure. The <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION> said after the crash that it would investigate several cases in which the specialists failed to maintain orderly trading in stocks they controlled. <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON> <PERSON> Gamsin </PERSON> said the announcement Friday marked the conclusion of those investigations. As is <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION> policy, she declined to elaborate on what the specialists did or failed to do. But she reiterated the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>'s position that `` we think the specialists did an excellent, though obviously not perfect job. <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Hewitt </PERSON>, a staff attorney at Spear, <ORGANIZATION> Leeds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Kellogg </PERSON>, said the firm would have no comment on the <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION>'s action. A receptionist who answered the telephone at <ORGANIZATION> Stern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>'s office said nobody was available to comment. A brief <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION> press statement said the exchange would reallocate <ORGANIZATION> Stern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>'s rights in <ORGANIZATION> Loctite </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s stock following a review of the specialist firm's actions on Black Monday, Oct. 19. The statement said Spear, <ORGANIZATION> Leeds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Kellog </PERSON>'s specialist rights were removed from <ORGANIZATION> Alleghany </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Greyhound </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> because of the firm's performance on Oct. 20; and its specialist rights were moved from <ORGANIZATION> Kysor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industrial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> because of the firm's Oct. 22 performance. `` After discussions with the <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Stern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> and Spear, <ORGANIZATION> Leeds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Kellogg </PERSON> agreed voluntarily to withdraw as the specialist in each of the stocks,'' the statement said. An <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION> committee that assigns stocks to specialists was accepting applications from other firms that want to make markets in the four stocks and will likely announce its decision next week, Ms. <PERSON> Gamsin </PERSON> said. For Spear, <ORGANIZATION> Leeds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Kellogg </PERSON>, one of the biggest <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION> specialist firms, it was the second reallocation resulting from post-crash inquiries. Previously, the firm surrendered its franchise in <ORGANIZATION> J.P. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morgan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>'s stock. In addition, the specialist firms <PERSON> Wagner </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Stott </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> M.J. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Meehan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Co.. <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> O'Donnell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> LaBranche </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> have relinquished market-making rights in some stocks since the crash

 The purchase of Lucky markets by <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> should be stopped because it would cost <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> consumers millions of dollars a year in higher food prices, the state attorney general said Friday. Attorney General <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Kamp </PERSON> filed suit in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> here late Thursday, seeking to block the $ 2.5 billion purchase of <ORGANIZATION> Lucky </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> by <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION>, which runs the supermarket Alpha Beta. <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Kamp </PERSON> said a merger of the two companies would violate state antitrust laws. The deal, and the unrelated purchase of 172 Safeway stores in southern <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> by the <ORGANIZATION> Vons </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cos. </ORGANIZATION>, had been approved by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, which analyzes the effect of business combinations on competition and prices. But <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Kamp </PERSON>, standing in an alley beside one of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION>'s Alpha Beta markets in the predominantly Hispanic <LOCATION> Westlake </LOCATION> district, accused the <ORGANIZATION> FTC </ORGANIZATION> of failing to protect the interests of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> consumers `` This injustice will strike most cruelly at those least able to afford it _ the poor, the elderly, the least mobile of our citizens, those who can not afford high prices and who can not flee their neighborhood market for distant lower prices,'' <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Kamp </PERSON> said. American has said the deal would result in lower prices because of the efficiency of a larger operation. <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Kamp </PERSON> sought a temporary court order blocking the American-Lucky combination until a trial, but <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kenyon </PERSON> delayed a decision until Tuesday so he could study the case. Meanwhile, <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Kamp </PERSON>'s staff continued to negotiate with <ORGANIZATION> Vons </ORGANIZATION> on a settlement of similar allegations about the El Monte-based grocery chain's $ 408 million purchase of 172 Safeway stores in <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Vons </ORGANIZATION> already has started converting the stores. <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Kamp </PERSON> said the talks appeared to be making progress, but warned he would take <ORGANIZATION> Vons </ORGANIZATION> to court immediately if the negotiations broke down. American, which recently moved its corporate headquarters from <LOCATION> Salt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Irvine </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, is one of the nation's largest supermarket companies. Its holdings include Acme markets on the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Skaggs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alpha </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beta </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Alpha </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beta </ORGANIZATION> and Buttery in the West and the 27-state <LOCATION> Osco </LOCATION> drug chain. The transactions would give the combined <ORGANIZATION> Alpha </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beta-Lucky </ORGANIZATION> chain 550 stores and <ORGANIZATION> Vons </ORGANIZATION> 350 stores, with the two chains together owning half the supermarkets in the state. In opposing the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> mergers, <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Kamp </PERSON> cited a study commissioned by his office that found the combination of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Alpha </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beta </ORGANIZATION> with Lucky and the Safeway-Vons deal would increase food prices by $ 400 million a year in the state As a condition of its approval, the <ORGANIZATION> FTC </ORGANIZATION> required <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> to sell 37 markets to competing chains to maintain competition. <ORGANIZATION> Vons </ORGANIZATION> was required to sell 12 stores.

 <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supply </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> System </ORGANIZATION>'s executive board on Friday approved a settlement removing <ORGANIZATION> WPPSS </ORGANIZATION> from a securities fraud case that goes to trial next week in <LOCATION> Tucson </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ariz </LOCATION> The board met in private for an hour and then approved the settlement in a brief public meeting. The fraud lawsuit is the result of the 1983 default by <ORGANIZATION> WPPSS </ORGANIZATION> on $ 2.25 billion worth of bonds sold to begin construction on two nuclear power plants in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state. The plants were abandoned, only partially complete, in 1982. Removal of <ORGANIZATION> WPPSS </ORGANIZATION> from the case leaves 21 <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> utilities, three engineering firms and a financial advisory firm as defendants. Trial is scheduled to begin Wednesday in federal court. <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Foleen </PERSON>, a member of the executive board, said <ORGANIZATION> WPPSS </ORGANIZATION>' settlement could be the first step in settling all remaining bondholder claims `` It's my belief it is in the best interest of the ratepayers of the region that we get this matter settled,'' he said. `` I hope the supply system's action will be a positive element in the region and become a catalyst for further reasonable settlement.'' By leaving the case, the supply system will save millions of dollars in legal costs. It already has spent more than $ 23 million over five years to get to trial, and had budgeted $ 7 million more for a year of trial. Much of <ORGANIZATION> WPPSS </ORGANIZATION>' trial-cost savings, however, are expected to be picked up by remaining defendants.
