 Bitingly cold arctic air and freezing drizzle iced highways Friday from the <LOCATION> Northwest </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> and south to <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, closing scores of schools and one state government and prompting increased aid for the homeless. The urge to play in new-fallen snow resulted in four sledding deaths in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. Twelve other deaths also were blamed on the weather, including four of hypothermia. A Greyhound Trailways bus with 15 people aboard spun around and overturned Friday on icy Interstate 70 in <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> near the <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> line. Police said six people suffered broken limbs and ribs. Helicopters took the injured to hospitals. Temperatures early Friday were below zero all the way south to the middle <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>, with readings of 20 below zero to 38 below zero over the <LOCATION> Dakotas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>, much of <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> and northwestern <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said. <LOCATION> Austin </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, fell from a high Thursday of 69 to a low Friday of 28, and a freeze warning was posted for the lower <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Grande </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>. Record lows were scattered from <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, including 35 below zero at <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Falls </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mont </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Mason </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, had a low of 20 below zero, but wind gusting to 31 mph produced a wind chill factor of 78 below zero. <LOCATION> Minong </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wis. </LOCATION>, hit 32 below zero. At noon, the temperature was only 27 degrees below zero at <PERSON> Bozeman </PERSON> and Butte, <PERSON> Mont </PERSON>. The weather service's official low for the Lower 48 states was 52 degrees below zero at Wisdom, <PERSON> Mont </PERSON>. But ahead of the cold air, 14 cities in the Southeast and <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> reported record highs, ranging from 61 at <LOCATION> Beckley </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> W. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, to 84 at <LOCATION> Jacksonville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla </LOCATION> The cold reached all the way to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> on Friday, less than five days before <PERSON> Mardi </PERSON> <PERSON> Gras </PERSON>. `` Snow, sleet, ice, or 80 mile an hour winds. Those are the only things that would stop a parade,'' said Assistant Police Chief <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Holman </PERSON>. In <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>, the first state struck by the frigid air that had previously stunned <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> and slid over <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, moderation of temperatures is n't expected until Monday or Tuesday, and then it could warm only to about zero, said weather service spokesman <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Doherty </PERSON>. The mass of cold air remained over the eastern two-thirds of <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, but temperatures continued to moderate. <LOCATION> Northway </LOCATION> was the coldest at 50 below, Fairbanks warmed up to minus 8 and <LOCATION> Anchorage </LOCATION> reached 10 above. A low pressure system moving in from the west warmed the western third of <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>; above the <ORGANIZATION> Arctic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circle </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Barrow </PERSON> reached 16 above and it was 20 above at <LOCATION> Prudhoe </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>'s state government reopened Friday after shutting down the day before because of the cold and wind, but <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> closed his government because of the cold and more than a foot of snow. <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Clinton </PERSON> gave state workers more time to get to work because of icy roads. An estimated 200 travelers had been stranded since Wednesday at <PERSON> Dubois </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, and roads out of the area remained closed by snow Friday, among a number of highways closed in the state. In southern <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Interstate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> 95 </ORGANIZATION> was closed from <LOCATION> Brunswick </LOCATION> to <ORGANIZATION> Freeport </ORGANIZATION> for 1 -LCB- hours after a 15-car pileup. No injuries were reported. Slippery roads and the cold forced school closings in <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state and <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>. Some colleges and universities also closed. Officials at <ORGANIZATION> Oregon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Corvallis </LOCATION> canceled classes for the fourth time in the school's 120-year history. The four sledding deaths in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> were unrelated. Three of the four, including a 6-year-old boy and a 12-year-old, occured in the <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> area; the fourth was in <LOCATION> Tacoma </LOCATION>. Of the 12 other deaths since the start of the cold wave, seven were traffic fatalities: four in <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION>, one in <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>, one in <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> and one in <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>. A utility worker was killed in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> while repairing a downed power line. And four people died of exposure, one in <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>, <LOCATION> S.D. </LOCATION>, one in <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Falls </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mont. </LOCATION>, one in Lame Deer, <LOCATION> Mont. </LOCATION>, and one in <LOCATION> Sioux </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>. Two school buses collided on an icy parking lot in <LOCATION> Indianapolis </LOCATION>, and 17 elementary school students suffered minor injuries, officials said. Many cities stepped up aid to the homeless. Shelters in <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> agreed to remain open during the day, rather than putting their clients out on the street until nightfall, said <PERSON> Christine </PERSON> <PERSON> Hager </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>'s coordinator for the homeless. The city also contracted with hotels to house homeless people, <PERSON> Hager </PERSON> said. Some homeless shelters in <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> reported operating beyond normal capacity. In <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION>, as many as 400 people slept outside Thursday night, including 150 in campsites, said <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Jo </PERSON> <PERSON> Copeland </PERSON>, director of Sharing and Caring, a day shelter for the poor. Four homeless people have been treated for frostbite. <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Royer </PERSON> asked residents to donate blankets, warm clothing, toiletries and non-perishable food for the city's homeless At <LOCATION> Paducah </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, hundreds of people were left without heat when a 4-inch natural gas pipeline ruptured. Temperatures were in the single digits at <LOCATION> Paducah </LOCATION> and residents were told to move to electrically heated buildings. <PERSON> Helena </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Mont. </LOCATION>, also had to cope with Thursday's train explosion that forced the daylong evacuation of thousands of people and left some without power. On Friday, officials asked residents to cut back on use of such things as space heaters and stoves to conserve electricity. Mail delivery was curtailed at <LOCATION> Mitchell </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.D. </LOCATION>, after two postal workers suffered mild frostbite in wind chill factors as low as 65 below zero, said Postmaster <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Kight </PERSON>.

<TEXT>
 Vice President <PERSON> Salvador </PERSON> <PERSON> Laurel </PERSON> said Saturday that doctors fear <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> has lost the will to live, has only a 10 percent chance of surviving the year, and wants to die in his own country. Laurel spoke to reporters after returning from <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION>, where the ousted <LOCATION> Philippine </LOCATION> president, accused of plundering billions from his homeland, is in exile. He said he would seek a meeting immediately with President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> to relay <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' wish and appeal `` to her sense of Christian values'' to allow the former president to come home to die. Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> has refused to allow <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> or members of his family to return from <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>, where they have lived since a popular uprising toppled his 20-year administration in February 1986. <PERSON> Laurel </PERSON> said doctors in <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION> told him that <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> might not survive the trip to the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> but that the former president would prefer to die on the plane rather than on foreign soil. A newspaper in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> quoted a <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> official as saying Saturday that the government has decided not to allow <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> to return and would even bar his body from being sent back after he dies. The Philippine Daily Inquirer quoted Cabinet Secretary <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> as saying the government feared <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' supporters would try to destabilize the <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> administration if their leader came home. `` We ca n't risk the gains by any destabilization effort which could derail us,'' <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> was quoted as saying. The newspaper quoted unidentified government sources as saying the Cabinet considered allowing <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> to return to <LOCATION> Laoag </LOCATION>, capital of his home province of <ORGANIZATION> Ilocos </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Norte </ORGANIZATION> about 250 miles north of <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>. But the idea was rejected because of fears <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> would not honor the restriction, the paper Laurel visited <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' hospital bedside Thursday without Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>'s blessing. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>, 71, remained in critical condition Friday in <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Francis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>'s intensive care unit, but an attorney said <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> was buoyed by <ORGANIZATION> Laurel </ORGANIZATION>'s visit and doctors said his fever had subsided. <PERSON> Laurel </PERSON> declined to disclose details of his conversations with <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>, his doctors and his wife, <PERSON> Imelda </PERSON>. `` Whatever our past differences and conflicts, the reality is that the crisis in this man's life can seriously affect political stability of the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>. Now is the time for compassion and forgiveness in order to achieve much needed unity among all Filipinos,'' <PERSON> Laurel </PERSON> said in a statement Thursday night. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> and his wife are under <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> indictment for allegedly plundering the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> of more than $ 100 million and stashing much of the money in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. When <ORGANIZATION> Laurel </ORGANIZATION> was asked whether <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> would ever return to his homeland, he replied: `` That's up to her,'' referring to Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' son, <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, said he relayed a letter to Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> asking that his father be allowed to return. Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>, who has repeatedly refused to allow <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> to return, said she had not received the letter. `` I can just make a decision once I know what the letter is all about,'' she told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Laurel </PERSON> conceded his was a personal, not official, visit, but said he would make a full report to Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> was breathing with the assistance of a respirator following emergency surgery Wednesday to reduce fluids building up in his lungs. Hospital spokeswoman <PERSON> Norma </PERSON> <PERSON> Kop </PERSON> said <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> was alert but unable to talk because of the respirator. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> was admitted to the hospital Jan. 15 for treatment of pneumonia and bronchial asthma. In December, he was hospitalized twice with congestive heart failure. The Marcoses would need permission from the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney general and the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> to leave the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, according to Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> LaBella </PERSON>, the prosecutor in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government's racketeering case against <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> and his wife. A federal judge in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> is to decide this month whether <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> is healthy enough to stand trial on criminal racketeering charges. Mrs. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> pleaded innocent and is free on $ 5 million bail.

<HEAD>First Lady Supports Ban on Assault Weapons</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> says she fears guns and, despite the president's membership in the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rifle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, favors banning the rapid-fire assault weapons used in a wave of gang killings and the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> rampage that left five children dead and 29 others wounded. The first lady, in an interview Friday, also expressed `` enormous sympathy'' for the financial plight of members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, who are taking political heat for a 51 percent pay increase. `` I know it sounds outrageous to people at home, but if they saw the cost of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> housing .... It's terrible. And the sacrifices the family makes,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. She said her family had not been able to live off her husband's salary in the 1960s when he was a member of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> from <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>, but had to rely on the money he had earned as an oilman She said they probably could have made it on his congressional salary if they had n't owned two homes and had n't wanted to send their children to private schools. Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said she did not want to discuss the `` politics and policies'' surrounding handgun ownership. Her husband, President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, opposes new federal handgun controls and is a lifetime member of the <ORGANIZATION> NRA </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> NRA </ORGANIZATION> is the most powerful lobby against laws regulating firearms. `` I myself do not own a gun,'' she said. `` I choose not to get into that. I'm afraid of guns. ... I'm so afraid I'd shoot the wrong person.'' <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, before moving to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> eight years ago, revealed she had owned `` a tiny little gun'' that she kept by her bed for protection while her husband was away. In her first White House interview in 1981, Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said she had gotten rid of the weapon. Marking the end of her second week in the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> spent part of Friday afternoon giving her first interviews since her husband became president. `` I feel at home here,'' she said, sitting on a couch, bathed in light from an arched window behind her. Asked if her husband had changed in any way since becoming president, she replied, `` I do n't see a difference with him.'' Pointing to several people in the room, she said, `` I see a difference in you and you and you. Not me. I mean it's just different when you're president. Everybody treats you differently when you're president.'' Joking about her husband's former status as vice president, Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` I spend half my life saying, ` Could you please get the vice president on the phone?' and the operator says, ` Do you really want <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>' or ` Do n't you know <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s in <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>.''' More seriously, she said, one big difference for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is that `` everything you say becomes major, and it is major. He is the president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.'' And yet, she said of her husband: `` I think he's exactly the same.'' She said many people who used to kid with her husband had stopped doing that briefly but `` after awhile they all became normal again. It just took a little while. ... `` I call him Mr. <PERSON> President </PERSON> sometimes _ when I'm needling him ... to tease him, ` Yes, Mr. President.''' The first lady was asked whether she favored enactment of laws banning sale to the public of military assault guns. Measures to outlaw the manufacture, sale or possession of a variety of rifles are pending in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and dozens of states. It was a Chinese AK-47 assault rifle that a gunman used in the rampage in which five children were killed and 29 others, were wounded in <LOCATION> Stockton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION> last month. Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said she thought such weapons already were outlawed. `` They should be, absolutely,'' she said. While refusing to discuss her position on handguns, Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said that she does not like to go hunting, as does her husband, an avid outdoorsman. `` I went hunting with <PERSON> George </PERSON> once,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> recalled. `` He told me to follow the bird, and I followed the bird and his head came right through that little circle -LRB- the rifle scope -RRB-. I put down the gun and said, ` That's it. I'm not going to do that again.'''

<HEAD>S&amp;L Crisis Occupies Bush, Advisers at Camp David</HEAD>
<HEAD>EDs: Camp David meeting 10 a.m. to 1 p.m. EST; tops unlikely.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was using his Camp David mountain hideaway today to work on a plan for solving the savings and loan crisis that aides said was unlikely to embrace a controversial deposit insurance fee. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was meeting at the <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> compound with <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>, Budget Director <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Darman </PERSON> and other key advisers to go over the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION>'s recommendations for S & amp; Ls. White House aides, speaking on condition of anonymity, said they did not expect the president to reach a final decision on the complete S & amp; L package, although a depositors' fee seems to have been ruled out. Administration officials have refused to disavow the fee publicly, but aides conceded privately that the plan most likely would not include it. On Friday, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> summoned congressional leaders to the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> to hear their advice. Just as in a Thursday meeting with industry officials, the president did not reveal his own preference from among the options discussed. From the congressional leaders, participants said, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> heard overwhelmingly one-sided advice against a proposal to charge depositors about 25 cents for every $ 100 in their accounts. `` I do n't recall anybody taking the other side of that issue,'' Sen. <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Riegle </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, D-Mich., the chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, told reporters afterward Both he and Sen. <PERSON> Jake </PERSON> <PERSON> Garn </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Utah </LOCATION>, the committee's senior Republican, predicted that the bailout package eventually agreed to by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the administration would include an increase in the premium that institutions pay for federal insurance, but no new direct fee on depositors. `` That deposit fee is not a live option,'' <PERSON> Garn </PERSON> said. `` I do n't think it was to begin with. The fees or insurance premium increase would help raise the $ 7 billion to $ 9 billion needed to pay the interest on the $ 85 billion to $ 100 billion in borrowing that the administration believes is needed to bail out insolvent thrifts. The president told the legislators that he hopes to have the administration's plan in place early next week. On Thursday, he addresses a joint House-Senate session on the budget. At the meeting Friday, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told lawmakers: `` Whatever we come up with will not be popular, and I expect that whatever you come up with will not be popular. But we've got to get the problem solved. `` There are no easy answers, and no worrying about blame _ plenty to go around.'' Meanwhile, in another development, federal regulators late Friday announced the resignation of <PERSON> Stuart </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Root </PERSON>, the executive director of the fund that insures savings and loan deposits. Root, appointed to head the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> in October 1987, submitted his resignation on Monday. It will be effective Feb. 10. Replacing Root as acting director will be <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Creedon </PERSON>, currently principal deputy director of operations, said the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> FSLIC </ORGANIZATION>'s parent agency. She had previously served as acting <ORGANIZATION> FSLIC </ORGANIZATION> director from December 1983 until March 1987. Root last year presided over the sales or closings of 205 insolvent institutions and the `` stabilization'' of 18 others at a combined cost of $ 38 billion.

 The owner of the Just Sweats clothing chain, his partner and a doctor were charged with murder Friday in an alleged $ 1.5 million insurance scam involving the faked death of the owner. <PERSON> Melvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hanson </PERSON>, co-founder of the <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION>, Ohio-based athletic clothing chain; his partner, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Barrett </PERSON> <PERSON> Hawkins </PERSON>; and Dr. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Pryde </PERSON> <PERSON> Boggs </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Glendale </LOCATION> were charged in the murder of <PERSON> Ellis </PERSON> <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Greene </PERSON>, 32. <PERSON> Green </PERSON>'s body was found in <PERSON> Boggs </PERSON>' office April 16 and was misidentified as that of <PERSON> Hanson </PERSON>. <PERSON> Hanson </PERSON>, 47, who was arrested last week carrying <PERSON> Greene </PERSON>'s driver's license, is being held in a <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, jail on grand theft charges under a $ 5 million bond <PERSON> Hawkins </PERSON>, 25, who collected $ 1 million in death benefits on <PERSON> Hanson </PERSON>, remains at large. <PERSON> Boggs </PERSON>, 56, was arrested Friday and held without bail pending arraignment Monday. <PERSON> Hanson </PERSON> was believed dead until mid-1988, when police in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> discovered that a man identified as <PERSON> Hanson </PERSON> who died in <PERSON> Boggs </PERSON>' office was not <PERSON> Hanson </PERSON>. The discovery and the fact that <PERSON> Hawkins </PERSON> had cashed $ 1 million in life insurance checks prompted authorities to file federal warrants for their arrest. Authorities allege that <PERSON> Hanson </PERSON>'s death was faked to collect the insurance money. The murder charges against all three men carry special circumstances that make them eligible for the death penalty. The special circumstances alleged are murder for financial gain and aiding and abetting. Ten charges were filed against each man, including murder, conspiracy to commit murder, insurance fraud, grand theft, and assault with a stun gun. <PERSON> Boggs </PERSON>, 56, told police he believed the man found dead in his office was <PERSON> Hanson </PERSON>. He said the man died after complaining of chest pains. <PERSON> Hawkins </PERSON> had the body cremated the next day. Police later discovered that a thumbprint from the corpse did not match the one on <PERSON> Hanson </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> driver's license. The body, which resembled <PERSON> Hanson </PERSON>, later was identified as <PERSON> Greene </PERSON>, a former Ohioan who lived in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Hanson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hawkins </PERSON> also are accused of stealing about $ 2 million from Just Sweats, which they founded in 1985. The company has filed for protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bankruptcy code.

 Gen. <PERSON> Andres </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> was sworn in as president Friday after ousting President <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON> in a coup that reportedly left scores dead. <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> ordered the dictator out of the country he had ruled for 34 years. <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON>, who had been <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON>'s second-in-command in the army and whose daughter is married to <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON>'s son, took the oath of office and swore in a nine-member Cabinet comprised of seven civilians, an active general and a retired general. Paraguayans poured into the streets to celebrate the military coup and to gape at damage left by hours of heavy fighting between rebel soldiers and police and troops loyal to <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON>. `` My government will respect the human rights of everyone to make democracy a reality,'' <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON>, five rows of medals on his shirtfront, said during a short speech at the 19th century National Palace overlooking the broad <LOCATION> Paraguay </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Cox </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> newspapers </ORGANIZATION>, quoting from a classified <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> report, said Friday that <PERSON> Rodriquez </PERSON> is considered by law enforcement authorities in <LOCATION> Paraguay </LOCATION> to be the country's No. 1 drug trafficker. The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> on Saturday quoted <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoyt </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, a professor of Latin American history at <ORGANIZATION> Indiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> in </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Terre </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Haute </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Ind. </LOCATION>, as saying, `` <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> has reportedly provided protection, airfields and an air taxi service to people smuggling drugs northward.'' At least 18 soldiers and a handful of civilians were killed during fierce clashes between troops loyal to <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON> and <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church-run </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Caritas </ORGANIZATION> said, saying that the total could top 200. It gave no source or explanation for the wide fluctuation. Officials at the main military and police hospitals refused to give figures on casualties, and the new government made no estimate. But a police sergeant said on condition of anonymity: `` I'm sad for my 35 dead companions. About 150 soldiers died at the presidential escort batallion, and two civilians.'' <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON>, 76, was put under house arrest at an army base, about 30 of his followers and aides detained, and the hierarchy of the government and ruling <ORGANIZATION> Colorado </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> replaced. <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON> was ordered out of the country, and unconfirmed reports said he was going to <LOCATION> Santiago </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION>. But Gen. <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Mardones </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Santiago </LOCATION> police commander, said: `` He is definitely not coming here tonight. He is still in <LOCATION> Paraguay </LOCATION>. That's official.'' <PERSON> Mardones </PERSON> said he believed <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON> was leaving <LOCATION> Paraguay </LOCATION> Saturday morning, `` but we do not know where to. Not necessarily <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> was cheered by several thousand citizens as he took the oath of office and swore in a Cabinet. About 15,000 accompanied him to the <ORGANIZATION> Colorado </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> headquarters and cheered again when he appointed <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramon </PERSON> <PERSON> Chaves </PERSON>, 87, as party president, replacing pro-Stroessner militant <PERSON> Sabino </PERSON> <PERSON> Montonaro </PERSON>. `` We're going to have a true democracy!'' shouted <PERSON> Domingo </PERSON> <PERSON> Laino </PERSON>, president of the National Accord group of four opposition parties and <LOCATION> Paraguay </LOCATION>'s best-known human rights advocate. `` I think that the era of terrorism and corruption that affected our country for so long has come to an end, thanks to the armed forces,'' said <PERSON> Aldo </PERSON> <PERSON> Zuccolillo </PERSON>, publisher of <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Color </ORGANIZATION>, the country's biggest newspaper at the time <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON> closed it down in 1984 for printing news the government did n't like. <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON>, however, said nothing about elections nor how long his provisional presidency would last. He spoke at his swearing-in ceremony and in a nationwide address hours earlier in which he declared he was `` taking command of the country from this moment.'' <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON>, 64, commands the <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION>, the premier unit of the mostly-conscript, 12,500-man army. Diplomats and political observers said his coup was provoked by <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON>'s attempt to force him to retire, his personal dislike for <PERSON> Montonaro </PERSON> and the growing influence of the military pro-Stroessner wing of the <ORGANIZATION> Colorado </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> took advantage of what observers said was widespread military resentment at the forced, and allegedly politically motivated, retirements of about 130 army colonels and navy captains last month. At about 9:45 p.m. Thursday night, shooting broke out at the corps' base in <LOCATION> Loma </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pyta </LOCATION>, four miles north of the capiital. Soon after, 40 to 50 tanks rumbled out of the base heading downtown toward the headquarters of the police and <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON>'s presidential guard. `` They did n't even ask us to surrender,'' said a member of the presidential guard, located next to the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in a fashionable neighborhood of streets lined by fine homes and old mango trees. `` They just opened fire and battered down the gates with small tanks.'' Army units around the country rallied to <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON>' side, and the lack of support for <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON> was broadcast throughout the capital by <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Primero </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> de </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marzo </ORGANIZATION>, which the rebels took over. The two TV stations in the capital abruptly went off the air after the shooting started, as did all radio stations except Radio Caritas and <PERSON> Radio </PERSON> <PERSON> Primero </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Marzo </PERSON>. As light dawned and Paraguayans ventured from their homes, they saw the main building at the presidential guard roofless and with gaping holes in its brick walls. The modern National Telephone building behind the police station was a mess of twisted metal and shattered glass. Pools of blood that dried quickly into large red stains were beside bullet-riddled cars. In front of the presidential guard, scene of some of the heaviest fighting, were the bodies of a dozen soldiers who died defending <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON>. The coup was as successful as it was sudden and unexpected. By afternoon, <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> was in complete control. There were no apparent pockets of resistence to his authority, no condemnations by foreign governments. <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON> had been a staunch <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ally, but in 1986 the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration labeled his government a dictatorship. He has been reported in poor health since prostate surgery five months ago.

<TEXT>
 The head coach of a high school football team was suspended for allegedly staging a photo session on school grounds in which some of his players posed with a machine pistol, an assault rifle and a bayonet, school officials said. <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Pearson </PERSON>, a physical education teacher at <ORGANIZATION> Oxon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Prince </LOCATION> <LOCATION> George </LOCATION><LOCATION> 's </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, Md. was placed on administrative leave with pay on Monday after school officials learned that defensive players on the school's football team posed, weapons in hand, for the promotional poster on Jan. 27. A student told school officials that <PERSON> Pearson </PERSON> asked him to bring the weapons to school, officials said Friday. The weapons were not loaded when they were confiscated by school security officers and turned over to police, school officials said. The student, who is enrolled at the school but is not a member of the <LOCATION> Oxon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> football team, was temporarily suspended Monday, school officials said. The players said the poster was intended to be used as a publicity stunt to showcase the team's `` top guns'' and originally was supposed to be staged at the county jail. That did n't work out, so they staged the photo session at the school. `` It was a pretty innocent thing,'' one player, who asked not to be identified, told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>. `` The idea was to make the guys look tough, that's all.'' The incident occurred one day after four students were shot at another high school in nearby <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Three Mile Island Can Boil Away Water Left over From Accident</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The operator of the <LOCATION> Three </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mile </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> nuclear plant has been given clearance to boil away 2.3 million gallons of radioactive water that is part of the legacy of the nation's worst commercial nuclear accident. About 260,000 gallons of the water has been sitting in the reactor building basement since the accident at the <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> plant in 1979. The rest of the water was used in cleanup operations since the accident. General Public Utilities Nuclear, the plant operator, proposed to get rid of all the water by boiling it into steam released from a 100-foot-high stack, and packaging impurities for shipment to a low-level radioactive waste dump. But two <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> citizens' groups challenged the decision, expressing concern about the release of radiation into the atmosphere. The groups asked the <ORGANIZATION> Atomic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Licensing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> _ which is part of the <ORGANIZATION> Nuclear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regulatory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> _ to consider other alternatives, including storing the water in tanks for perhaps 30 years to allow radiation to decay. But after holding hearings in <LOCATION> Lancaster </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, the licensing board said in a written decision that the storage plan `` is not obviously superior to the evaporation proposal.'' `` We are convinced that implementation of -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> GPU </ORGANIZATION> Nuclear's -RRB- proposal will have extremely small radiation exposure consequences, both to workers and the general public,'' the board said. Last spring, <ORGANIZATION> GPU </ORGANIZATION> Nuclear raised eyebrows among local citizens by spending initial $ 800,000 on the evaporation system even before the licensing board had held hearings to decide whether the system could be used. <PERSON> Kay </PERSON> <PERSON> Pickering </PERSON>, spokeswoman for <ORGANIZATION> Three </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Island </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alert </ORGANIZATION>, an anti-nuclear group, said at the time that it was `` distressing'' that the plant operator had apparently acted prematurely. But <ORGANIZATION> GPU </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nuclear </ORGANIZATION> said it was merely trying to plan ahead, and that it would abide by whatever the board decided. The $ 7 million evaporation process is part of the $ 1 billion cleanup of <ORGANIZATION> Three </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Island </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Unit </ORGANIZATION> 2. During the accident, uranium fuel was allowed to lose the vital cooling water the normally covers it, causing material in the core to melt.

<HEAD>Trump Needs Only FAA Approval to Take Over Eastern Shuttle</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> needs only a safety certification from the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> to clear the way for his takeover of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>' profitable Northeastern shuttle service. The <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> declared his organization financially fit Friday, giving final approval of an economic certification for the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> real estate magnate. The department had given tentative approval of the planned $ 365 million purchase two weeks ago and it became final after no objections were raised by interested parties, said department spokesman <PERSON> Hal </PERSON> <PERSON> Paris </PERSON>. `` As far as we're concerned, he can fly,'' said <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>. He said the department determined that <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> had the managerial talent and the financial resources to operate what is to be renamed the Trump Shuttle. <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Leyden </PERSON> said there is no deadline for issuing an operating certificate but it could be approved within the month. <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> had said he wanted to begin the service under his name this month. <PERSON> Leyden </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> has to determine whether <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> has the ability to run a safe airline by examining all his plans, including pilot training, maintenance and operating procedures. Once the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> gives its approval, the sale by <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s Houston-based holding company, can become final and <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> can repaint the shuttle's 17 <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 727 jetliners with his name and gold, red and black stripes. <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> has been trying to sell off the Shuttle and some other <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> assets, arguing that it needs cash for Eastern to survive. A federal judge approved the sale last December over objections from labor leaders who said it was part of a <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> effort to dismantle <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> and reconstruct it as a nonunion company. Judge <PERSON> Barrington </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Parker </PERSON>, in his opinion, recognized the union-management struggle but said it was also plausible that the company was trying to rebuild and place itself on sound financial footing. The union has said it would appeal the decision. <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> already owns a helicopter service that flies between <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, where he owns casinos, and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, where he has built up a real estate empire. He announced an agreement to purchase the shuttle service last October. Eastern says the shuttle, which employs 850 people and makes 62 flights a day, made average annual profits of $ 17 million over the last five years while the airline itself lost $ 233.7 million in the first nine months of 1988. <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> has vowed to recognize unions representing pilots, flight attendants and mechanics but has not guaranteed current wages. Eastern has offered to retain any shuttle workers who wish to remain with the company.

<TEXT>
 A state jury on Friday ordered <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> to pay $ 1.5 million in damages to the family of an Italian man and his son who were among the 520 people who died in the 1985 crash of a <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 747 in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. Attorneys for the Italian widow, <PERSON> Heidi </PERSON> <PERSON> Moroni </PERSON>, 48, and her 18-year-old son, <PERSON> Alessandro </PERSON>, had sought more than $ 6 million in damages from the Seattle-based airplane company, said <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> lawyer <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> McLaughlin </PERSON>. Killed were <PERSON> Giancarlo </PERSON> <PERSON> Moroni </PERSON> and a second son, <PERSON> Andrea </PERSON> <PERSON> Moroni </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> has admitted liability in the crash, saying improper repairs it made after the plane scraped its tail during a hard landing in 1978 were to blame. The <ORGANIZATION> King </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> jurors deliberated a day and a half before returning their decision. The amount of damages was the only issue to be decided in the <LOCATION> Moroni </LOCATION> case and three others, all involving non-Japanese victims, that are pending in <LOCATION> King </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>. Damage suits filed on behalf of 71 Japanese nationals against <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lines </ORGANIZATION> have been moved to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> for trial. According to Japanese press reports last month, there have been out-of-court settlements with families of 377 of the crash victims. <PERSON> McLaughlin </PERSON> described the award as `` reasonable,'' and said the only portion <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> might challenge is $ 200,000 for the suffering endured by the two in the half-hour the damaged plane remained aloft before it crashed into a mountain. The plane lost its tail and rudder 12 minutes after takeoff, and over the next half-hour the pilot fought to regain control of the crippled jet. Four survived the crash.

<TEXT>
 When the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> wanted to prepare an annual report to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on its Superfund toxic waste cleanup program, it sought out a consultant. <ORGANIZATION> ICF </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> prepared the document for $ 260,000. Congressional critics maintain that little more than the letterhead was changed on the draft received from the private company before it was sent to <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>. `` Three words were changed, two ` ands' and a ` the','' complained Sen. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Pryor </PERSON>, D-Ark., who held a hearing Friday on the widespread use of private consultants by the federal agency responsible for cleaning up the environment He said one of his major concerns is that many of the consultants working for the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> `` also have private sector clients from the very industries the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> is charged with regulating'' raising questions about conflict of interest. <PERSON> Pryor </PERSON> and other critics suggested that the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> _ and most likely other federal agencies and departments as well _ are relying too heavily on private contractors to do work, including critical analysis and often decision-making, that the government ought to be doing. <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> officials acknowledged in testimony before <PERSON> Pryor </PERSON>'s Government Affairs subcommittee that they make extensive use of consultants, but maintained that precautions are taken to avoid a conflict of interest. They insisted that decision-making remains in agency hands. `` It comes down to workload. It's a matter of resources,'' <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Longest </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION>'s Superfund cleanup program, where contractors are used widely, told the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> panel. But <PERSON> Pryor </PERSON>, who has waged a decade-long fight against the federal government's extensive use of private consultants, did not accept the explanation. `` Consultants do everything from working on enforcing compliance with <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> regulations to writing <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION>'s annual reports,'' Pryor declared in opening the hearing. `` It appears that the basic work of <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> has been delegated to private consultants.'' The senator cited the case of a <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> subcontractor found by congressional investigators to have recommended a particular cleanup method for a toxic waste dump. It turned out that the same company owned the rights for that cleanup method and was given the job, said <PERSON> Pryor </PERSON>. <PERSON> Pryor </PERSON> also cited the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> contracts with <ORGANIZATION> ICF </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, including the one for preparing the agency's annual report to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on Superfund, as another example where questions of conflict of interest might be raised. While <ORGANIZATION> ICF </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, has several so-called `` sliding'' contracts with the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> valued for as much as $ 15 million, it also aggressively seeks business with private companies that are subject to <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> regulation and `` boasts of its <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> connection in its promotional literature,'' said <PERSON> Pryor </PERSON>. Earlier this week the <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assessment </ORGANIZATION>, which is <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>' scientific research agency, also criticized the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> for relying too much on contractors in its Superfund cleanup program, suggesting that contractors and not <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> officials are running the program. Superfund is the $ 8.5 billion program through which the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> is tackling hundreds of toxic waste cleanup projects across the country.

 A program to help prevent the spread of AIDS among intravenous drug abusers by distributing free sterile needles has been delayed due to a shortage of disposable syringes, organizers said. The sponsoring agencies, Portland-based Outside In and the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> for AIDS Research, had planned for the program to begin in July but had difficulty insuring the program. The groups found a company in November to provide medical liability insurance, but <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> stipulated that the distributed needles must be of such a design that they could not be re-used. Outside In has been negotiating with a British company to supply single-use hypodermic syringes, agency director <PERSON> Kathy </PERSON> <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> said Wednesday. Delivery had been promised Jan. 1, but the manufacturer ca n't mass produce them, she said. <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> said the supplier is having 1,500 syringes manufactured each month. Outside In will need a couple of thousand each month for its distribution program, she said. She said she did n't know when the supply problem would be resolved. Epidemiologists have said that direct blood contamination through shared needles is the most rapid way acquired immune deficiency syndrome is being spread.

 A ship laden with more than 50 tons of equipment headed toward the <LOCATION> Antarctic </LOCATION> today to try and contain an oil spill that experts say is killing wildlife and threatening to wipe out a colony of baby penguins. The spill, from a sunken Argentine supply ship, has fouled the once-pure waters of a pristine bay and was endangering more than 24,000 penguins and other nesting birds, said biologist <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Laca </PERSON>. `` It's very disturbing. Everything right now is worrisome,'' said <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Laca </PERSON>, a researcher at the Palmer Station, a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> research outpost on the <LOCATION> Antarctic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peninsula </LOCATION>. About 52 tons of equipment flown from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was loaded onto the 219-foot Polar <ORGANIZATION> Duke </ORGANIZATION> here from a giant <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> C-5 Galaxy cargo plane. The Polar Duke departed shortly after 6 p.m. Friday and was expected to reach the area in four days. The oil is leaking from the Argentine research and supply ship <ORGANIZATION> Bahia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Paraiso </ORGANIZATION>, which is trapped and nearly submerged on shoals in the <LOCATION> Bismarck </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strait </LOCATION> just off the <LOCATION> Antarctic </LOCATION> peninsula. Thousands of penguins, terns, gulls and other birds live around the site of the accident, and the waters teem with marine life, including whales. Two areas nearby are set aside by the Antarctic Treaty for scientific study. Punta Arenas is at the windblown tip of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> about 600 miles from the stricken Argentine vessel. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Forhan </PERSON>, ocean projects manager for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, leads the cleanup mission. American scientists, wearing respirators as protection against the smell of oil fumes, are working in open boats to try to limit the damage, but <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Laca </PERSON> said `` virtually all of the area is exposed to fuel,'' causing young birds to disappear and killing small sea animals `` in large numbers.'' De <PERSON> Laca </PERSON> spoke by telephone with the The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. About 24,000 penguins nest in rookeries in the affected area, and <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Laca </PERSON> said 38 of the 40 adult birds checked by scientists have been `` fuel-dipped.'' The fear of the experts, he said, is that penguin chicks, due to leave nests within a few days, will swim in the oil-coated water and be sickened or killed. At least three dead penguins have been sighted, said <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Laca </PERSON>. `` All of the rookeries are surrounded by oil,'' he said. A number of seals were seen to be covered with oil and were acting in a `` lethargic fashion,'' said the scientist. `` We have a slick 150 meters -LRB- yards -RRB- by 2 miles long going south from the vessel,'' moving `` along and a little bit away'' from the coast, <PERSON> Forhan </PERSON> said in an interview aboard the Polar Duke. He said there were reports of birds smothered by oil and of dead krill, shrimp-like creatures that whales feed upon in large numbers, floating ashore. Scientists and workers at <LOCATION> Palmer </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Station </LOCATION> collected 112 compressed gas cylinders and 15 oil drums from the waters around the wreck, <PERSON> Forhan </PERSON> said, and `` there are more in the water.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Bahia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Paraiso </ORGANIZATION> ran aground Jan. 25. The more than 250 people aboard were taken off without injury. Authorities said the ship carried at least 200,000 gallons of fuel oil in its tanks and more in drums lashed to the deck.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> says U.S.-Japanese relations entail `` some confrontation at times'' and vows to make sure that <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> businesses gain fair access to markets in that nation. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> spoke Friday at a White House luncheon for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> business leaders as Japanese Prime Minister <PERSON> Noboru </PERSON> <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> wrapped up a two-day visit to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> was leaving Friday night for <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> and a meeting there next week with former President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. Speaking of the barriers <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> companies face entering Japanese markets, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> pledged `` to do my level best ... to be sure that we are treated fairly, that we have access, that we ... are not operating under standards that favor one side to the detriment of the other.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> observed that he and <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> `` are realistic men ... and we realize we are going to have some confrontation at times, or certainly differences of opinion.'' The president added that he believes the prime minister `` wants very much to have a cooperative relationship.'' On Thursday, the two men pledged after their 2 -LCB- - hour meeting and lunch to strive to smooth irritations over the $ 50 billion <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> deficit with <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and tensions over the Japanese contributions to its defense effort <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> did not elaborate on the details of the trade problems he and the prime minister discussed on Thursday, but said they'd `` reviewed the progress that our nations have achieved in bringing the economies into better balance and of further opening our markets to each other's goods and services. He added that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> carries `` a disproportionate responsibility for the defense requirements of free countries'' and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, `` given its economic standing today, is willing to accept much more in the way of responsibility for helping ... in the whole development aid side of things.'' `` I just wanted to assure you that the visit yesterday had gone reasonably well,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told the businessmen. As the president spoke, Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> bid <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> a formal farewell at the end of his two-day <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> visit with a <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> luncheon of champagne toasts, pheasant and ice cream with mangoes. In remarks at the luncheon, the secretary of state also struck a cautionary note, telling <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> the two economic superpowers `` still face a difficult agenda.'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> also expressed hope the partnership will grow stronger as <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> assumes a broader world role. `` <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> is determined to do its utmost to collaborate with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, its strongest ally, for the peace and security of the world,'' the prime minister said, in his toast. `` No problems are unsolvable as long as <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> join in an effort to solve them,'' <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Environmental Damage Grows From Antarctica Fuel Oil Spill</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RECER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Birds and other wildlife in one of the most remote parts of the world are being injured and killed by fuel oil spilled from a ship wrecked on an <LOCATION> Antarctica </LOCATION> island, and more damage is possible before cleanup crews arrive. Biologist <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Laca </PERSON>, chief scientist at <ORGANIZATION> Palmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Station </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Antarctica </LOCATION>, said that more than 24,000 penguins and other birds are endangered by an oil spill that threatens to wipe an entire generation of chicks maturing in nests surrounded by the pollution. Some wildlife already has been killed, he said. `` The environment has been compromised in a way that we ca n't even evaluate right now,'' <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Laca </PERSON> said in a telephone conference call from <LOCATION> Palmer </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Station </LOCATION> `` It's very disturbing. Everything right now is worrisome.'' Palmer Station scientists, wearing respirators to protect against the eye-stinging fumes of the oil slick, worked in open boats to recover debris littering the fouled bay and to evaluate the damage. But <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Laca </PERSON> said a more effective effort to contain the spill must await the arrival Monday of a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> oil pollution control team from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. He said the fuel oil is spilling from the Argentine ship <LOCATION> Bahia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paraiso </LOCATION> at the rate of about two gallons a minute and if it continues the vessel could dump about 250,000 gallons into the previously pure, untainted waters nearby. The ship, which doubled as a cruise ship and a supply vessel for an Argentine research station, ran aground near <LOCATION> Palmer </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Station </LOCATION> last Saturday. It later floated free, went aground again 1.1 miles from the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> outpost and then turned over on its right side against another island. As it turned, fuel oil and deck cargo spilled into the Palmer Station embayment, home to a number of large bird rookeries. Palmer Station is a <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> research station. Twenty-six scientists and staff are now working at the station under the director of <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Laca </PERSON>, the chief scientist. <PERSON> Palmer </PERSON> is about 600 miles south of <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Horn </LOCATION>, the tip of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Laca </PERSON> reported that krill, a tiny shrimp-like crustacean, have been killed by the thousands and are lining the nearby beaches. Birds feeding on the krill seem sickened, he said. In a nesting area of the Polar Skua, a bird of prey, up to 40 percent of the chicks have disappeared, possibily because parent birds sickened by the oil are unable to protect their young, he said. About 24,000 penguins nest in rookies in the affected area, and <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Laca </PERSON> said that 38 of 40 adult birds checked by scientists have been `` fuel dipped.'' A number of seals were seen to be covered with oil and were acting in a `` lethargic fashion,'' said the scientist. The precise number of animals killed by the oil is difficult to calculate because other animals quickly eat the dead. `` It's pretty depressing,'' he said.

Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Warner </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Va </LOCATION>., declined on Friday to say what the information dealt with But other sources indicated it concerned Tower's personal life, and specifically alcohol and women. `` It's just another chapter in an ongoing investigation,'' <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> said. `` I do n't attach any more significance to this chapter than to any other.'' He said an <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> report on the subject should reach the committee `` on Monday and ... we can proceed to a vote Tuesday or Wednesday.'' <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> was looking into allegations concerning `` Tower's behavior at a party last year in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>.'' <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> reported that the allegations involve an alleged liaison in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> between Tower and a woman from an Eastern bloc nation, along with an allegation of excessive drinking in the past year. According to <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION>, the new allegations include a report from an <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> colonel which said Tower had 14 separate liaisons with women while he headed the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> negotiating team in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> after leaving the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. The committee had been expected to vote Thursday to recommend <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> confirmation of Tower, but that was postponed after the emergence of the new allegations. Tower, meanwhile, sought to dispel any impression of an embattled nominee, meeting for about two hours at his Jefferson Hotel residence with five people likely to be named to deputy posts at the Pentagon. He later issued a statement, saying the meeting had been scheduled for a week `` and had nothing to do with the proceedings before the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>.'' Editorials in <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>, two widely circulated industry publications, called for Tower to withdraw his nomination. The editorials are scheduled to appear in Monday's editions. <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>, a 49-year-old independent publication, said Tower's public position `` has been so compromised by the agonizing process by which he was nominated and is being confirmed ... that he can not be the strong spokesman the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> needs now. <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION>, also an independent publication, suggested Tower's links to defense consultants is the most troubling aspect of the recent confirmation process, and said, `` There is ample reason to doubt whether Mr. <PERSON> Tower </PERSON> is the man for these times. At the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said: `` Our feeling is he will be confirmed.

<TEXT>
 The 32 people sent into the jury pool this week in the trial of <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON> have one thing in common: All say they know almost nothing about <PERSON> North </PERSON> and the Iran-Contra affair. Most of the prospective jurors said they simply glance at front-page newspaper headlines and most say they are too busy with jobs or occupied with other interests to have paid much attention to the biggest foreign policy debacle of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration. Most are blue - or pink-collar workers, several with the government, while several others are unemployed or retired One woman is holding down two jobs. Of the first 25 prospective jurors, a dozen finished the 12th grade, one has a master's degree, two others finished college and another has some college education. Their occupations range from cement finisher to mental health administrator and the focus of their lives is work and family, not politics and controversy. On Friday, one of the prospective jurors, a woman who supervises 50 employees at the <ORGANIZATION> Willard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hotel </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, explained that she circled the name <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Coors </PERSON> on the jurors' questionnaire as a name with which she is familiar because substantial amounts of the brand-name beer are delivered to the hotel. Occasional talk by co-workers about the Iran-Contra affair, said the woman, had bored her during her 10 - to 12-hour workdays Coors, who contributed money to the Contras after meeting with <PERSON> North </PERSON>, is scheduled to testify for the prosecution at <LOCATION> North </LOCATION>'s trial. North attorney <PERSON> Brendan </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> told the woman that the name on the cans is the same as the name on the questionnaire and that the beer magnate would be pleased to know `` you buy a lot of it.'' North, who took the nationally televised congressional Iran-Contra hearings by storm in 1987, has through smiles and gestures made contact from across the courtroom with the potential jurors who will decide his fate. But it is unclear whether he has made much of an impression with jurors who say they just barely recall having seen pictures of him in uniform a year and a half ago. One man sent into the jury pool thought <PERSON> North </PERSON> might be the man who kept `` blinking'' and `` winking'' at him constantly as the prospective juror underwent questioning from <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Gerhard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON>, prosecutor <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Keker </PERSON> and <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>. North signaled that the prospective juror had guessed right by giving him a thumbs-up sign. <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> said as he concluded Friday's court session that he wants a pool of 45 people to choose a panel of 12 jurors and six alternates. The jury selection process resumes Monday.

 The 1974 felony conviction of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Yankees </ORGANIZATION> owner <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinbrenner </PERSON> hurt his business interests and was a source of personal humiliation, according to his successful application for a presidential pardon. Former President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> granted the pardon just before he left office last month. For example, the papers note: Last summer, <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> racing officials denied <PERSON> Steinbrenner </PERSON> an owner's license at <ORGANIZATION> Canterbury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Downs </ORGANIZATION>, the state's first parimutuel thoroughbred racetrack, because of his conviction; Against his wishes, <PERSON> Steinbrenner </PERSON> declined a nomination to serve as a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regents </ORGANIZATION> governing <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s public universities `` because of the adverse publicity to the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> educational system that would likely ensue.'' And he has suffered the indignity of being referred to in articles as `` a convicted felon'' and the `` only convicted felon among baseball's ownership.'' `` The harm suffered by Mr. <PERSON> Steinbrenner </PERSON> is far more than economic; it is a symbolic slap in the face for a man who has tried so hard to overcome his conviction and be a good citizen,'' <PERSON> Steinbrenner </PERSON>'s lawyer, former attorney general and senator <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Saxbe </PERSON>, wrote in the application. The documents were obtained by The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> after a special application to the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Steinbrenner </PERSON> was pardoned Jan. 19 by <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, 17 years after he attempted to `` influence and intimidate'' employees of his shipbuilding company into lying to a grand jury about the nature of a $ 100,000 contribution to <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>'s 1972 re-election campaign. <PERSON> Steinbrenner </PERSON> pleaded guilty to conspiring to violate federal election laws.

<HEAD>Deaver Abandons Perjury Appeal, Cites Desire to Put it Behind Him</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Former White House aide <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Deaver </PERSON> says he is broke and tired of being `` a captive of the system.'' So, on Friday, he dropped the appeal of his conviction of lying to a congressional subcommittee and a federal grand jury, saying he wanted to `` put this period of my life behind me.'' <PERSON> Deaver </PERSON>, a top adviser to former President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and a close friend of the former first family, said in a statement issued by his lawyers that he was dropping the appeal `` with the firm belief that I was not guilty of the charges of which I was convicted.'' However, he said, `` to proceed with this appeal means to continue to live in doubt, to continue to wait for a decision, and, if my appeal is successful, to face another trial, a process which could mean another two years of agony and doubt.'' He also said he could not continue the `` financial burden'' of the appeals process. The 50-year-old onetime <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> deputy chief of staff was fined $ 100,000 and ordered to perform 1,500 hours of community service for his three felony convictions in 1987 of lying about his lobbying of former administration colleagues after leaving the White House. `` My decision to withdraw my appeal does not come easily,'' <PERSON> Deaver </PERSON> said in the statement issued as his lawyers asked the appellate court here to dismiss his appeal. `` It results from a number of factors, primarily my desire to put this period of my life behind me and get on with whatever lies ahead,'' <PERSON> Deaver </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Deaver </PERSON> must now begin performing the community service which <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Penfield </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> set as a condition of three years of probation when he sentenced him last September. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> has not yet specified what type of community service he will order. <PERSON> Deaver </PERSON> said his `` belief in my innocence has not changed from the day the long and arduous proceedings against me began three years ago.'' <PERSON> Deaver </PERSON> resigned as deputy White House chief of staff in 1985 to start a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> public relations firm. He was convicted in December 1987 of lying under oath to the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> oversight and investigations subcommittee and a grand jury.

<TEXT>
 About 3,000 people were evacuated from the East End after a large unexploded German bomb dating from World War II was discovered at a housing site, <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION> Yard reported. <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> bomb disposal officers called to the scene Friday worked through the night, but the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> said in a statement it could take two days to render the 1,000-pound bomb harmless. The statement said the explosives would have to be steamed out of the bomb because it was considered too dangerous to try to transport the bomb from the area. The bomb was found standing upright against a wall in Whitechapel, haunt of the notorious murderer <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> the </PERSON> <PERSON> Ripper </PERSON>, who killed five women in 1888 and was never caught. It was unearthed by a mechanical digger driven by <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornton </PERSON>, who was digging excavations for new houses. Bombs dropped during the war that failed to go off are periodically unearthed in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. The East End was especially heavily bombed by the Germans during the war in a bid to cripple the <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> docks. Police cordoned off the area and authorities evacuated people from their homes around the Sidney Street housing project. Those evacuated stayed with friends and relatives or at local council offices that were hurridly turned into temporary shelters. Twenty roads into the area also were closed to traffic.

 The nation's biggest leveraged buyout now depends on which of the two corporations involved makes the best ketchup, nuts and Chinese food. In a decision announced Friday, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> said it would not challenge the $ 24.5 billion acquisition of <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION> by <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kravis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Roberts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> if <ORGANIZATION> KKR </ORGANIZATION> within a year sells: _ The Chun King oriental line of <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION> or the <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Choy </ORGANIZATION> line of <ORGANIZATION> Beatrice-Hunt-Wesson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a unit of <ORGANIZATION> KKR </ORGANIZATION> _ The Planters nuts line of <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION> or the Fisher nuts line of <PERSON> Beatrice </PERSON> _ And <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Del </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Monte </LOCATION> ketchup or <PERSON> Beatrice </PERSON>'s Hunt ketchup Together, the corporations account for one-eighth of the food sold in the nation's supermarkets. The <ORGANIZATION> FTC </ORGANIZATION> said the two must reduce their share of the markets for ketchup, oriental foods and packaged nuts, in order for the market to remain competitive. A spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> KKR </ORGANIZATION> said that to his knowledge, no decisions had been made on which product lines to keep and which to sell off. <ORGANIZATION> KKR </ORGANIZATION>'s tender offer for <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION> shares was to expire at midnight EST Monday, but <ORGANIZATION> KKR </ORGANIZATION> late Friday extended its offer to 10 a.m. EST Thursday. The second step of the merger process, involving the exchange of securities not tendered to <ORGANIZATION> KKR </ORGANIZATION>, must still occur and there is no time limit for completion of that portion of the deal. Under an agreement between the <ORGANIZATION> FTC </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kravis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Roberts </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> KKR </ORGANIZATION> must maintain <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION> as a separate operation until the three product lines are sold. Before divestitures, the merged company would control about 12 -LCB- percent to 13 percent of the market for manufactured foods, said <PERSON> Jeffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Zuckerman </PERSON>, head of the commission's <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Competition </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Zuckerman </PERSON> declined to give estimates of market share held by each of the lines but did give these estimates if the brands were combined: <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> <PERSON> King-La </PERSON> <PERSON> Choy </PERSON>, `` probably slightly under 60 percent'' of $ 300 million in sales; Del Monte-Hunt ketchup, about 25 percent of $ 500 million; and Planters-Fisher nuts, `` about 50 percent'' of $ 1.5 billion. Although market share is a concern, `` we look at other factors, the most important of which is the ease with which other people could enter the business'' if the company tried to raise prices, he said.

<TEXT>
 The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration still publicly endorses the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration's approach toward solving the $ 1.3 trillion Third World debt problem and is searching for ways to make that approach more workable. Discussion on Third World debt dominated two days of meetings that wrapped up Friday between finance officials of the non-communist world's seven most powerful economies _ the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>. The meetings had been billed as a get-acquainted session for the new <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration as it completed its second week in office. Treasury Secretary <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>, who was host for the discussions along with <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON>, said that a review of conditions around the world showed the global economy was performing reasonably well, an opinion that was seconded by his fellow finance ministers. <PERSON> Tatsuo </PERSON> <PERSON> Murayama </PERSON>, the new Japanese finance minister who was attending his first Group of Seven meeting, said that he believed prospects for the world economy were brighter than they were five months ago because currency fluctuations had stabilized and inflation appeared to be moderating. <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> said that the seven countries had a `` thorough discussion'' regarding Third World debt with no decisions being taken. `` Several ideas were discussed for strengthening the agreed-on strategy based on the same principles we consider valid,'' <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> said. `` Growth, economic policy changes and reforms in the debtor countries, the continued need for external financing -LRB- by debtor nations -RRB- and continued observance of the case-by-case method.'' These were all goals of the <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> plan, drafted in 1985 by <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>'s predecessor, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, who is secretary of state in the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration, crafted an approach to Third World debt that stressed increased loans in exchange for economic reforms made by the developing countries. While the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> repeatedly rejected calls to forgive some of the debt, <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> has found itself increasingly isolated on the debt issue as political stresses have risen in debtor countries. These nations are suffering falling living standards because of the growing burdens they face in servicing their huge debts. While <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> made no mention of any modifications he would like to see to the debt plan, other finance ministers said they believed changes would be proposed and possibly adopted at the group's next meeting, in early April, when the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monetary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION> holds its spring meeting in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. Canadian Finance Minister <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> said the officials examined a number of options, including proposals made by the French to create a new international fund to guarantee interest payments by the poorer nations and a Japanese proposal to provide more money for loans. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has pledged to review the American policy on Third World debt, but so far the administration has not revealed any modifications to the <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> plan that it would consider acceptable. The meetings of the `` Group of Seven'' are generally held three or four times a year to review economic conditions and search for ways the countries can better coordinate policies to promote global prosperity. At present, the issues of concern are efforts to stabilize currencies, lower the still-huge trade imbalances which exist and provide relief to Latin American nations straining under a heavy debt burden. Participants said that <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> assured the other nations of President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s commitment to lower the budget deficit, a longtime matter of concern with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> allies who believe <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s huge borrowing needs have deprived their economies of needed capital. <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> said that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was seeking to cooperate with <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to find a way to reduce the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> budget deficit by $ 60 billion in the next fiscal year, which begins Oct. 1, officials said. Participants said that finance ministers were generally pleased with how the effort at greater policy coordination was working, including the drive to prevent wild fluctuations in the value of the dollar. In contrast to past meetings when the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> greenback was under heavy selling pressure, the dollar at present has been relatively stable.

 White House Counsel and chief ethics adviser <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Boyden </PERSON> <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> says he will continue to serve as chairman of his family's large communications company but will give up the fee he collected during his eight previous years as vice presidential counsel, a published report says. The <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> also reported today that <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> was a very active investor during those eight years, moving hundreds of thousands of dollars annually in and out of the stock market and various partnerships, including real estate, oil and gas, electronic, computer and other high-tech companies. The Associated Press could not reach <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> at his home Friday night. The <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> told the paper Friday that in order to conform with new ethics guidelines pledged by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, he will no longer accept a fee from the family company, <ORGANIZATION> Summit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> which was founded by his father in 1948. He told the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> he has reduced his holdings to real estate partnerships, government bonds and a multimillion-dollar interest in <ORGANIZATION> Media </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, another communications giant. However, <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> said he does not see any need to further divest himself or create a blind trust for his remaining investments, as members of the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration have been encouraged to do. <PERSON> Gray </PERSON>'s past participation in the management of his investments, currently estimated at $ 10 million, was reported as required on government disclosure statements and did not violate the law. <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> served as general counsel to the <ORGANIZATION> Presidential </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Task </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> on Regulatory Relief, which <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> chaired, during <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s first term as president.

 A spokesman for <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> says the former president would use the controversial proposed pay raise for members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> and federal judges for security. Responding to a request by <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Keating </PERSON>, executive vice president of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Taxpayers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> for <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> to publicly oppose the pay increase, spokesman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> wrote in a letter: `` The <ORGANIZATION> Nixons </ORGANIZATION> are now paying for their own security, an expense of over $ 500,000 since 1985.'' `` It is RN's intention to apply whatever increase may be enacted in his pension entirely toward defraying the cost of his and Mrs. <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>'s security,'' <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> added. The raise which would increase Cabinet salaries from $ 99,500 to $ 155,000 would increase <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>'s pension as a former president by the same amount because of a 1971 law linking the two amounts.

<HEAD>Soviet Defector's Saga To Freedom In Israel</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SERGEI SHARGORODSKY</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
 When Soviet Jewish scientist <PERSON> Yakov </PERSON> <PERSON> Kogan </PERSON> contacted <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> officials in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> last week to say he wanted to defect, little did he know the complications he faced. First, he was told, `` Prove you are Jewish'' _ a serious problem because <PERSON> Kogan </PERSON> had left his identity card thousands of miles away in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. What followed was a nightmarish saga of wrong airports, problematic telephones, delays and mixed directions _ proving to <PERSON> Kogan </PERSON> it was n't as easy to defect as he may have thought. <PERSON> Kogan </PERSON>, a 48-year-old mathematician and computer expert, told the <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> daily <ORGANIZATION> Yediot </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ahronot </ORGANIZATION> he first thought of defecting while attending the scientific seminar as part of a six-member <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> delegation. `` I thought this was the chance to reach <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. ... Who knows if this opportunity would ever be repeated,'' he said in the interview published Thursday. <PERSON> Kogan </PERSON> decided to phone Israeli diplomats in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>. But the task proved complicated. `` I did not want to phone from the hotel and I was looking for public telephones. But soon I discovered you can not use a coin for every telephone and that for some you need a magnetic card,'' <PERSON> Kogan </PERSON> said. Contact was finally established. But then came the Israeli demand: `` Prove that you are Jewish.'' <PERSON> Kogan </PERSON>'s Soviet-issued identity card, which he left behind in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, stated he was Jewish. But the passport he carried made no mention of his religion. According to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s Law of Return, all Jews are eligible for automatic Israeli citizenship. `` They asked: ` What Jewish holidays do you remember?''' <PERSON> Kogan </PERSON> recalled. `` I told them with a stressed Yiddish accent: <PERSON> Rosh </PERSON> <PERSON> Hashana </PERSON> -LRB- the Jewish New Year -RRB-, Yom Kippur -LRB- the Day of Atonement -RRB-, and of course Shavuot -LRB- a holiday celebrating the spring harvest -RRB-'' he said. The officials were not immediately convinced. But the next day, when <PERSON> Kogan </PERSON> called back, officials told him to take a taxi to <LOCATION> Orly </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> and go to the El Al -LRB- <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s airline -RRB- counter. <PERSON> Kogan </PERSON> left all his belongings at a hotel, toured the Quai D'Orsay museum and left for the airport. But there were more problems ahead. `` They only forgot to tell me that <LOCATION> Orly </LOCATION> is divided in two, West and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION>, with the first one designated for internal flights only,'' he told <ORGANIZATION> Yediot </ORGANIZATION>. When <PERSON> Kogan </PERSON> finally reached his destination, time was running out. `` I ... could not find the El Al counter. Then I started to walk around slowly, and gradually saw the word ` Tel Aviv' appearing on display screens,'' the bespectacled, gray-haired <PERSON> Kogan </PERSON> said Thursday on <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION>. He said he passed through French passport control with the help of an <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Al </ORGANIZATION> official, who issued him an Israeli visa. Then he was brought to an empty plane. `` They told me that I can relax now, that this is <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> territory,'' he said. Take-off was delayed for what seemed an endless 30 minutes, <PERSON> Kogan </PERSON> said. Once the plane took off, he destroyed a piece of paper on which he had written the number of his <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> contacts in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, as they had ordered. `` At -LRB- <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION>'s -RRB- <LOCATION> Ben </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gurion </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>, two men were waiting for me.

I knew I would be refused,'' apparently on grounds that he knew state secrets, he said.

<HEAD>Oil May Have Fueled Kenyan-Sudanese Clash Of the Cartographers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By REID G. MILLER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Call it the Muddle of the Maps or the Clash of the Cartographers, but <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION> are at it again over a disputed area of dismal swamp and desert. The dispute goes back years, but neither side appeared to be paying much attention to it until recently, and a discovery of oil may have roiled their dispute over soil. In 1914, the British drew a straight line marking <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION>'s northwestern border with <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION> But in 1938, the British, who then ruled the East African nations, decided to give <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION> administrative control of a triangular piece of land north of the <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION> border. The area, known as the <ORGANIZATION> Elemi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Triangle </ORGANIZATION>, contained 1,393 square miles of seemingly worthless land and was home to the nomadic <LOCATION> Turkana </LOCATION> tribe, which was constantly raiding and being raided by other tribes from <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Uganda </LOCATION>. The British administration in <LOCATION> Khartoum </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION>'s capital, was unable to police the raiders and handed over administration of the area to authorities in the Kenyan capital of <LOCATION> Nairobi </LOCATION>, which was much closer. The 1938 agreement resulted in a new line on the map, this one putting the triangle in <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION>. There the matter rested until 1956, when <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION> gained its independence, followed by <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION> seven years later. The newly independent governments began drawing their own maps _ <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION>'s with the original 1914 straight line, <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION>'s with the triangular border. `` From that time on,'' said <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION>'s charge d'affaires in <LOCATION> Nairobi </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Yousuf </PERSON>, `` We have had two opinions.'' <PERSON> Yousuf </PERSON> told reporters Friday that a joint border commission met in the late 1970s but failed to resolve the matter, and the dispute once again faded. But last year, <PERSON> Yousuf </PERSON> said, <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION> published a new map that not only included the Elemi Triangle within its borders but enlarged the triangle by 2,489 square miles. <PERSON> Yousuf </PERSON> said he called the news conference `` to clarify the position of the <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION> government.'' He was not, he insisted, discussing `` our borders with <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION> through the press.'' But most of the argument has been waged through reporters. The newly revived dispute began with a front-page story in Monday's <ORGANIZATION> Kenya </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>, an English-language daily published in <LOCATION> Nairobi </LOCATION> by the ruling <ORGANIZATION> Kenya </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> party. Headlined, `` It's a Map of Provocation,'' the story noted that thousands of maps published by a Scottish company, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Bartholomew </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Son </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>, of <LOCATION> Edenburgh </LOCATION>, showed the straight 1914 border between <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION>. The next day, the newspaper's top story carried the banner headline, `` <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION> Claims Kenyan Soil.'' On Wednesday, at a reception for foreign journalists, <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION>'s foreign minister, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Ouko </PERSON>, made it a point to mention the dispute He, too, said he would not discuss the matter in the press, but added, `` The Elemi Triangle is an integral part of <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION> and that's the way it will remain. The two governments have not officially discussed the problem anew. Pressed Friday at the news conference, <PERSON> Yousuf </PERSON> said he did n't `` have enough information as to who is doing what in this disputed area,'' but suggested <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION> may have found oil in the region President <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> arap </PERSON> <PERSON> Moi </PERSON> announced last month oil had been found in northern <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION>, but did not specify where.

 Death came to <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sipple </PERSON> without any of the fanfare that once anguished the disabled ex-Marine, who became a reluctant hero when he foiled an assassination attempt on President <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Ford </PERSON>. A friend found <PERSON> Sipple </PERSON>, 47, dead in his <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> apartment on Thursday, apparently of natural causes. A framed letter of commendation signed by <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> hung on the wall. <PERSON> Sipple </PERSON> gained unwanted fame on Sept. 22, 1975, when he lunged for a .38 - caliber chrome revolver aimed at <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> by would-be assassin <PERSON> Sara </PERSON> <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> outside a <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> His move caused <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>'s shot to go astray, hitting a building instead. Afterward, <PERSON> Sipple </PERSON> telephoned news outlets and begged them not to mention his name, his address or `` anything about me.'' `` I'm not a hero, I'm a live coward,'' he said later. `` It's probably the scariest thing that ever happened in my whole life. But reports about <PERSON> Sipple </PERSON>, some mentioning his homosexuality, were published anyway. <PERSON> Sipple </PERSON> filed a $ 15 million invasion of privacy lawsuit against several newspapers, claiming he was abandoned by his brothers and sisters after they learned of his sexual orientation by reading published accounts. `` My sexuality is part of my private life and has no bearing on my response to the act of a person seeking to take the life of another,'' he said in the lawsuit, which was filed five days after the assassination attempt. He lost the five-year court battle when <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judge </ORGANIZATION> <PERSON> Ira </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> dismissed the suit. `` I think that his life was a very tragic life,'' attorney <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Wahl </PERSON>, who represented <PERSON> Sipple </PERSON>, said Friday. `` He did some very heroic things. He was 100 percent disabled from his service in the <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION>, then he went out of his way, endangering his life, to save the life of President <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Ford </PERSON> _ then he got punished for doing it.'' <PERSON> Sipple </PERSON>, who was on disability because of mental problems relating to his combat experiences in the Vietnam War, had originally come to <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> so that he could live as he wished without upsetting his family, according to <PERSON> Wahl </PERSON>. However, that all changed by the published accounts of his personal life. <PERSON> Sipple </PERSON>, though, never regretted his life-saving action, <PERSON> Wahl </PERSON> said. `` He just was astounded that some columnist and then the rest of the media would just take it upon themselves _ without ever asking him _ to publicize these personal facts about him,'' said <PERSON> Wahl </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Francisco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chronicle </ORGANIZATION> columnist <PERSON> Herb </PERSON> <PERSON> Caen </PERSON> first hinted that <PERSON> Sipple </PERSON> was homosexual, noting that the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> had not thanked him for his actions. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> eventually did convey his gratitude to <PERSON> Sipple </PERSON>. <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> pleaded guilty to the assassination attempt and is serving a life term in federal prison. A Coroner's Office spokesman said <PERSON> Sipple </PERSON> apparently died of natural causes but results of an autopsy performed Friday were not immediately available. A statement released by the office said <PERSON> Sipple </PERSON> had a pacemaker and a long history of hypertension and heart problems.

 Women in poodle skirts and saddle shoes and men in T-shirts with rolled-up sleeves danced to <ORGANIZATION> Buddy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Holly </ORGANIZATION> classics in memory of the rock' n' roll legend killed 30 years ago when his plane crashed in this small <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> town. About 2,000 fans gathered at the Surf Ballroom on Friday, braving snow, high winds and subzero temperatures similar to the conditions blamed in the Feb. 3, 1959, crash that also claimed the lives of <PERSON> Ritchie </PERSON> <PERSON> Valens </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> J.P. </ORGANIZATION> `` Big Bopper'' <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON>. The three had just played the Surf and were en route to <LOCATION> Fargo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.D. </LOCATION>, in the early morning hours when the small plane went down. `` This old-time music is the only thing that works anymore,'' said <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Fennigaoh </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Milwaukee </LOCATION>, decked out in a tuxedo, white socks and black sneakers. <PERSON> Fennigaoh </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Beth </PERSON>, were among those attending a sock hop at the 11th annual Buddy Holly reunion. `` I liked Buddy Holly even better than <PERSON> Elvis </PERSON> -LRB- Presley -RRB-. <PERSON> Elvis </PERSON> had more persona and was more macho. But <PERSON> Holly </PERSON> had purity, clarity,'' <PERSON> Fennigaoh </PERSON> said. Party-goers filed past the Feb. 3, 1959, edition of the <ORGANIZATION> Mason </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Globe-Gazette </ORGANIZATION> displayed in the ballroom lobby as 1950s and'60s music blared in the background. The newspaper featured six grisly black-and-white pictures of the wrecked airplane and one-column photos of <PERSON> Holly </PERSON> and <PERSON> Valens </PERSON>. Immortalized as `` the day the music died'' in <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> McLean </PERSON>'s 1972 pop song `` American Pie,'' the plane crash was the first great rock tragedy. <PERSON> Holly </PERSON>, with such hits as `` <PERSON> Peggy </PERSON> <PERSON> Sue </PERSON>,'' `` Rave On,'' `` Not Fade Away'' and `` It's So Easy,'' was only 22 when he died. <PERSON> Valens </PERSON>, 17, already was known for such songs as `` Donna'' and `` La Bamba.'' <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON>, a former disc jockey, had made it big with the song, `` Chantilly Lace.'' For more than a decade the faithful have flocked to the ballroom to honor the man who changed the face of rock' n' roll with his inventive lyrics, irresistable melodies and inimitable <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> twang. `` My mom grew up with this music and she always played it around the house. I never got into that loud, banging kind of music,'' said <PERSON> Tamera </PERSON> `` <PERSON> Tammy </PERSON><PERSON> '' </PERSON> <PERSON> Kriegel </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Grinnell </LOCATION>, who was n't even born in 1959 _ she's 28 _ but has been coming to the <ORGANIZATION> Buddy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Holly </ORGANIZATION> reunion for the past five years. The walls of the 50-year-old ballroom are lined with portraits and posters of <PERSON> Holly </PERSON>. A 6-foot tombstone etched with the names of the dead and the words `` Their music lives on'' stands just inside the entrance. <PERSON> Darryl </PERSON> `` Mad Hatter'' <PERSON> Hensley </PERSON>, who organized the annual observance 11 years ago when he was a disc jockey with <ORGANIZATION> KEZV </ORGANIZATION> radio, said more than 2,000 tickets were sold at $ 45 each for this year's bash `` I love this stuff,'' said <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Crowther </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Marshalltown </LOCATION>, who was 8 years old when <PERSON> Holly </PERSON> died. `` I've been into it since I was knee-high to nothin'.'' <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON>, 32, who has come to the reunion for six years from his home in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, arrived early Friday afternoon. `` I enjoy visiting you colonials, but I'm here to remember <PERSON> Buddy </PERSON> <PERSON> Holly </PERSON>,'' said <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON>, a railroad conductor. `` Did you know that in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Buddy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Holly </ORGANIZATION> is second in popularity to <PERSON> Elvis </PERSON> <PERSON> Presley </PERSON>?'' <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> is one of 14 people from <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> who attended Friday as temperatures hovered near 19 below zero and wind chills hit minus 50 degrees. Another Briton, <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Needham </PERSON>, 46, of <LOCATION> Upminster </LOCATION>, sold memorial T-shirts for $ 8 each in a hotel lobby. `` I remember the first time I heard him was when ` That'll Be The Day' came on the jukebox. ... The feeling I got from his music was that his songs were just being sung to me personally,'' said <PERSON> Needham </PERSON>, co-founder of the British <ORGANIZATION> Buddy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Holly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>, which he said claims just under 300 members.

 The founders of an athletic-clothing chain and a <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> doctor have been charged with murder in the slaying of a man whose death authorities say was faked to collect $ 1.5 million in insurance. <PERSON> Melvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hanson </PERSON>, co-founder of Just Sweats of <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, his partner, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Barrett </PERSON> <PERSON> Hawkins </PERSON>, and Dr. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Pryde </PERSON> <PERSON> Boggs </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Glendale </LOCATION>, were charged Friday with murder, conspiracy and insurance fraud.

But police later discovered that the thumb print of the corpse did not match the one on <PERSON> Hanson </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> driver's license. The body subsequently was identified as <PERSON> Greene </PERSON>, a former Ohioan. A felony complaint issued by the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Attorney </LOCATION>'s office traces the trio's activities over a three-year period The scheme allegedly began with <PERSON> Hanson </PERSON>'s applications for multiple life insurance policies in 1986. <PERSON> Hanson </PERSON> signed a will in 1987 leaving all his property to <PERSON> Hawkins </PERSON>. Upon his death, <PERSON> Hanson </PERSON>'s will directed that his body be cremated and that none of his relatives be notified, according to court documents. In January 1988, the complaint said, <PERSON> Hanson </PERSON> rented a <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> condominium using an alias and the next month consulted a plastic surgeon about changing his appearance. <PERSON> Hanson </PERSON> on April 15 flew from <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, where he and <PERSON> Boggs </PERSON> killed <PERSON> Greene </PERSON> the next day, the complaint alleges. <PERSON> Hanson </PERSON> left <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> the same day, using the name <PERSON> Wolfgang </PERSON> <PERSON> Von </PERSON> <PERSON> Snowden </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Hawkins </PERSON> flew to <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> to claim the body identified as <PERSON> Hanson </PERSON>'s. <PERSON> Hawkins </PERSON> began filing claims for payments of death benefits on <PERSON> Hanson </PERSON> two weeks later, according to the court record. <PERSON> Hanson </PERSON> underwent cosmetic surgery to disguise his appearance a month after the slaying, and began using the name and identification of the victim, <PERSON> Greene </PERSON>, as well as the name <PERSON> Von </PERSON> <PERSON> Snowden </PERSON>. <PERSON> Hawkins </PERSON> went to <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>, authorities said, where he used the name <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Greene </PERSON>. Records of telephone calls among <PERSON> Hawkins </PERSON>, <PERSON> Hanson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Boggs </PERSON> dating to December 1987 helped authorities uncover the alleged conspiracy. <PERSON> Hanson </PERSON> was arrested on Jan. 29 at <LOCATION> Dallas-Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Customs agents as he returned from <LOCATION> Acapulco </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. Authorities said he was carrying identification cards under 13 names. <PERSON> Hanson </PERSON> appeared in court in <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION> Friday, where he was advised that he had been charged with theft in the alleged scheme. He was being held in the <LOCATION> Franklin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jail </LOCATION> in lieu of a $ 5 million bond. <PERSON> Hawkins </PERSON>, 25, who collected $ 1 million in death benefits on <PERSON> Hanson </PERSON>, remains a fugitive, authorities said. <PERSON> Boggs </PERSON> was being held without bail in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> and his arraignment was scheduled for Monday afternoon. <PERSON> Hanson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hawkins </PERSON> also are accused of stealing about $ 2 million from Just Sweats, which they founded in 1985. The company has filed for protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bankruptcy laws. Authorities said it was unclear whether the victim was known to any of the three men and the method by which he was killed has not been established.

<HEAD>Laurel Appeals To Aquino To Allow Marcos To Die At Home</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Vice President <PERSON> Salvador </PERSON> <PERSON> Laurel </PERSON> said today that an ailing <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> may not survive the year and appealed to President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> to allow her ousted predecessor to die in his homeland. Laurel spoke to reporters after returning from <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>, where he met the 71-year-old former president. He said he was told by doctors that <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' heart, lungs and kidneys were failing and the former president had lost the will to live. There was no immediate comment from Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>, who has refused to allow her predecessor to return to the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> since her February 1986 `` <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revolution </ORGANIZATION>'' ended the 20-year <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> regime. But a <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> newspaper, the <ORGANIZATION> Philippine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inquirer </ORGANIZATION>, quoted a <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> official as saying the government would refuse even to allow <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> to be buried in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>. Presidential spokesman <PERSON> Teodoro </PERSON> <PERSON> Benigno </PERSON> has said <PERSON> Laurel </PERSON> was acting without Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>'s blessing when he went to see <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>. Relations between Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Laurel </ORGANIZATION> have been strained since the vice president quit his <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> post as foreign minister in 1987 over policy differences. Last August, <ORGANIZATION> Laurel </ORGANIZATION> formally parted ways with Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> when he demanded her resignation and announced he was joining an opposition coalition. <PERSON> Laurel </PERSON> said he would try to contact Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> immediately to ask for an appointment so he could relay to her <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>'s request to come home. He would also hand Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> a letter from <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' son, <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, containing the same request. Asked if <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> had offered to return part of the billions of dollars he allegedly embezzled, <PERSON> Laurel </PERSON> replied he was `` not at liberty to answer that.'' Later, he told another reporter no offer was made. <PERSON> Laurel </PERSON> said doctors believe <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> might not survive the trip to the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> but that <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> told him he `` does n't mind ... and he would be happy dying on his way home.'' `` He told me he has already resigned his fate to Almighty God,'' <PERSON> Laurel </PERSON> said. `` Mr. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> expressed to me his desire to die in his own country.'' He said <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> was concerned for the future of his wife, <PERSON> Imelda </PERSON>, and three children, and added that they also should be allowed to return. Before Laurel's trip, unconfirmed news reports said he and wealthy Filipino industrialist <PERSON> Enrique </PERSON> <PERSON> Zobel </PERSON> were trying to work out a deal under which <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> would return part of his `` hidden wealth'' in exchange for permission to return. Asked how he would try to change Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>'s mind about banning <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>, <PERSON> Laurel </PERSON> said that he `` will invoke the fundamental right of any Filipino to come home ... I will try to appeal to her sense of Christian and moral values.'' <PERSON> Laurel </PERSON> said that his conversation with <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> was carried on `` intermittently'' because of the former president's poor health. Last Wednesday <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> underwent a tracheotomy to clear fluids building up in his lungs. He has been breathing through a respirator since then. Quoting from a briefing given by doctors, <PERSON> Laurel </PERSON> said <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> was running a fever of 103 degrees and weighed less than 100 pounds. He said doctors told him <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' lungs had collapsed twice in three weeks, his transplanted kidneys were failing and his heart had grown too weak to pump enough blood. The doctors described <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' body as `` now destroyed'' and said `` he has less than 10 percent chance of survivial within the year,'' <PERSON> Laurel </PERSON> said. Philippine officials have said in the past that <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> must return his allegedly embezzled funds and apologize for abuses in his administration before there could be any discussion of his return. In its report, the <ORGANIZATION> Philippine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inquirer </ORGANIZATION> quoted Cabinet Secretary <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> as saying the government would refuse <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> burial in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> because his followers would use the funeral to undermine Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> and his wife are under <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> indictment for allegedly plundering the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> of more than $ 100 million and stashing much of the money in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. A federal judge in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> is to decide this month if <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> is healthy enough to stand trial on criminal racketeering charges. Mrs. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> pleaded innocent and is free on $ 5 million bail.

<HEAD>Cold Stretching from Gulf of Alaska to Gulf of Mexico</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 An Alaskan cold front nearly completed its conquest of the lower 48 states today, putting highways on ice, chilling <PERSON> Mardi </PERSON> <PERSON> Gras </PERSON> festivities and making weather forecasters the target of some cabin-fever abuse. Frigid air pushed south and east, bringing subzero wind chills to normally balmy south <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, coating <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> with freezing rain and sending temperatures plunging across <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>. By Sunday, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said, the arctic air is expected to reach central <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, completing the southeastward march that began in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> about a week ago. Heavy snow fell in the <ORGANIZATION> Rockies </ORGANIZATION> and the <LOCATION> Sierra </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION>, and temperatures remained well below zero across much of the nation's midsection So far, at least 16 deaths around the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> have been blamed on the cold weather. <PERSON> Leo </PERSON> <PERSON> Burnett </PERSON>, a forecaster in the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> office in <LOCATION> Fargo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.D. </LOCATION>, said he and his colleagues were beginning to catch blame for the painfully cold weather. The high temperature in <LOCATION> Fargo </LOCATION> on Friday was 15 below zero, and some people needed a scapegoat. `` They're getting a little cabin fever, I guess, and they have to take their frustrations out on someone, so they call and kind of get all over the weatherman every once in a while,'' <PERSON> Burnett </PERSON> said. `` We've got thick skins.'' One man, he said, called to say, `` I'm just in a fit of depression, and I blame you guys. ... I've got to get out of here. I'm going to go to <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>.'' The caller had better move fast. Parts of the Southeast enjoyed record warmth Friday as they awaited the cold _ it was 77 degrees in <LOCATION> Apalachicola </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, breaking the old record for Feb. 3 by a degree. Other records included 77 in <LOCATION> Ashville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, 75 in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> and 84 in <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION>, S.C. But by midnight Friday, it was 49 in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, and forecasts called for the temperatures to continue dropping, possibly reaching into the teens by Tuesday. Temperatures dropped 40 degrees in parts of <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>, worrying strawberry farmers and casting a chill _ but not a pall _ over <PERSON> Mardi </PERSON> <PERSON> Gras </PERSON> festivities. `` Snow, sleet, ice or 80 mph winds _ those are the only things that would stop a parade,' said Assistant Police Chief <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Holman </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>. `` Cold weather does n't dampen many spirits, but it may cause people to drink more of them.'' Such parade-stopping conditions are n't likely in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>, but they provide a fair description of weather across much of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION>, where winter storm warnings were in effect early today in parts of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>. In northern <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, up to three feet of snow, whipped by winds of up to 70 mph, fell Friday in parts of the <LOCATION> Sierra </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> and more was expected today. The <ORGANIZATION> Utah </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Highway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Patrol </ORGANIZATION> reported `` lots and lots'' of minor accidents on slick, snowpacked freeways around <LOCATION> Salt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, but ski resort operators were cheering over the extra foot or more of snow that coated the nearby mountains. A Greyhound Trailways bus with 15 people aboard spun around and overturned Friday on an icy Interstate 70 in <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> near the <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> line. Police said 14 people were hospitalized in Grand Junction with broken bones. About 14 <ORGANIZATION> Denver </ORGANIZATION> high school basketball players and a coach were treated for possible carbon monoxide poisoning and hypothermia Friday night when a heater in their chartered bus apparently failed in bitter cold weather west of <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>. All were treated and released from two <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> hospitals. Subzero cold in <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> caused ice jams on the Bighorn, <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> <PERSON> Fork </PERSON> rivers. The town of Wisdom, <LOCATION> Mont. </LOCATION>, recorded the nation's lowest temperature of minus 52, and rancher <PERSON> Helen </PERSON> <PERSON> Carey </PERSON>, who lives about 30 miles south of <PERSON> Helena </PERSON>, said her newborn calves were losing their ears to frostbite. `` Poor little things, they've really had a tough go of it,'' she said. Power outages left people without heat in several places around the country, including the suburbs of <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo. </LOCATION>, where a record low of 7 below zero was recorded at the airport Friday. And in <LOCATION> Wassau </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wis. </LOCATION>, sponsors of the Badger State Winter Games considered calling off this weekend's cross-country ski races because of subzero cold.

<HEAD>Princess Diana Leaves NYC After Whirlwind Visit</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KILEY ARMSTRONG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Although her visit to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> was brief, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s Princess <PERSON> Diana </PERSON> seemed to capture the heart of the Big Apple wherever she went. In three days, she saw an opera in <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION>, visited a fancy toy store on Park Avenue and hugged a child with AIDS in a <LOCATION> Harlem </LOCATION> hospital. The Princess of <LOCATION> Wales </LOCATION> rubbed elbows with developer <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>, publisher <PERSON> Malcolm </PERSON> <PERSON> Forbes </PERSON> and actor <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON>. <PERSON> Diana </PERSON> also touched the heart of 13-year-old <PERSON> Hope </PERSON> <PERSON> Manley </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> youngster suffering from cystic fibrosis, and <PERSON> Wanda </PERSON> <PERSON> Morales </PERSON>, whom the princess visited in a lower East Side shelter for the homeless. On Friday, the last day of her visit, she toured the pediatrics ward of <LOCATION> Harlem </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> where <PERSON> Diana </PERSON> unexpectedly picked up a 7-year-old afflicted with AIDS after first asking him, `` Are you heavy?'' The 27-year-old princess has long sought to educate the public about the disease, which doctors say can not be transmitted through casual contact. The princess also attended a briefing by the hospital's pediatrics director, Dr. <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Heagarty </PERSON>, who said later that <PERSON> Diana </PERSON> was genuinely concerned about the plight of the children and occasionally interrupted to ask questions At the hospital, hundreds of excited workers strained to catch a glimpse of the princess. It had been the same throughout her visit as usually nonplussed New Yorkers sometimes breathlessly recounted a royal handshake or a wave. After her visit to the hospital, <PERSON> Diana </PERSON> attended a private reception given by British Consul General <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> Jewkes </PERSON> for about 60 patrons of the Royal Academy of Music. After that she left <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> as she had arrived, aboard a British Airways supersonic Concorde. Friday's events capped a visit that also included a visit to a homeless shelter and day-care center and the American debut performance by the <ORGANIZATION> Welsh </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Opera </ORGANIZATION> at the <ORGANIZATION> Brooklyn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Music </ORGANIZATION>. Cheering crowds greeted the princess at nearly every stop. The exception was when about 400 protestors showed up in <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION> to denounce <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s policies in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>. But inside the <ORGANIZATION> Brooklyn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Music </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Diana </PERSON> dazzled the audience as she entered to a drumroll and the opera patrons fell silent. And later that same evening, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s social elite again fell silent as the princess walked down a marble staircase to the dining area of a gala reception in her honor at the World Financial Center. The 800 or so guests remained silent until she approached her seat at the head table, when they broke into spontaneous applause. Her husband, <PERSON> Prince </PERSON> <PERSON> Charles </PERSON>, who stayed in <LOCATION> Britian </LOCATION> this week, will arrive in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> on Feb. 16 for a four-day visit to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Palm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, where he'll attend charity polo matches.

<HEAD>Lawmakers Consider Corrections For The Press</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A bill aimed at compelling newspapers and broadcasters to publish corrections of errors moved ahead in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commons </ORGANIZATION>, but legislators said it has little chance of final success. The bill, introduced by opposition <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> lawmaker <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Worthington </PERSON>, proposes a statutory right for members of the public to correct inaccuracies about them in the news media. Corrections would have to be given the same prominence as the original mistake. <PERSON> Worthington </PERSON> said his Right of Reply bill was needed because of what he called the `` deterioration in standards of some sections of the press.'' He said the bill, which was unopposed Friday in its second reading, was not an attack on press freedom but an attack on the few editors and proprietors who abused their power. Legislators said the government was neutral about the Right of Reply Bill, so it would not have any priority on the crowded parliamentary agenda. They said time was likely to run out before the bill was examined in committee or in the crucial third reading. After being approved by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commons </ORGANIZATION>, the bill would then have to go to the House of Lords. <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Renton </PERSON>, a Home Office junior minister speaking for the government, said scandal had been used to sell newspapers for hundreds of years. `` But ... we have a number of reservations about both the statutory control of the press and about the procedures set forth in the bill,'' <LOCATION> Renton </LOCATION> said. Labor legislator <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Clwyd </PERSON>, a journalist, said the bill was necessary to protect the public from what she called the excesses of the tabloid press. Two other bills dealing with the press failed in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commons </ORGANIZATION> Friday for lack of debating time. The Indecent Displays -LRB- Newspapers and Workplaces -RRB- bill, introduced by <PERSON> Laborite </PERSON> <PERSON> Clare </PERSON> <PERSON> Short </PERSON>, would have barred newspapers from publishing `` pictures of naked or partially naked women in sexually provocative poses.'' The Protection of Privacy bill, introduced by <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> lawmaker <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Browne </PERSON>, also failed. It would have given all citizens a legal right to privacy and compelled newspapers to show their revelations were `` for the public benefit.''

<HEAD>Reports: Some Foreign Hostages Will Be Released Soon</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MOHAMMED SALAM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A weekly magazine said today that two American hostages will be freed soon, and other publications reported the imminent release of some of the 15 foreign hostages held by pro-Iranian extremists. The magazine An-Nahar Arab and <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> said <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>, or Party of God, has `` decided to release two American captives as a goodwill gesture.'' The group, composed of Shiite Moslem fundamentalists loyal to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, is believed to be an umbrella for underground factions that have claimed the abduction of most of the Westerners missing since 1985. The magazine, based in Christian east <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, quoted an unnamed <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> official as saying: `` The scenario is being set for the release.'' The short report gave no other details. The weekly <ORGANIZATION> Al-Shiraa </ORGANIZATION> reported this week that the case of the foreign hostages `` has been put on a hot burner.'' While the magazine gained international fame when it broke the story of secret <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> arms sales to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> in November 1987, subsequent reports on the hostages have not proved accurate. `` This could result in releasing them ... in the light of a decision to this effect adopted by regional powers interested in this case,'' <PERSON> Al-Shiraa </PERSON> said without elaboration. There are 15 foreign hostages held in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, including nine Americans. The longest held is <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, 41, chief <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> correspondent for <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, who was abducted March 16, 1985. The independent daily An-Nahar and the conservative Ad-Diyar reported today that the release of foreign captives in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> was part of an agreement mediated by <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> this week to end a bloody inter-Shiite power struggle between <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> and the Syrian-backed mainstream Amal militia. `` Informed sources believe that the basic aim of the <ORGANIZATION> Amal-Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> accord is to work on the release of foreign captives held in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>,'' <ORGANIZATION> An-Nahar </ORGANIZATION>'s terse report said. Ad-Diyar, in an equally brief report, quoted an unnamed official as saying the <ORGANIZATION> Amal-Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> accord `` could result in the handing over of some foreign hostages to the Syrians.'' <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> is the main power broker in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. It has some 40,000 troops controlling Moslem areas, including northern and eastern provinces as well as west and south <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. The leftist daily As-Safir, which is close to the Syrian army command in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, said: `` Diplomatic information speaks of the possible release of some -LRB- foreign -RRB- hostages in the next two weeks.'' The report said the issue `` will be the focus of attention in the coming days. Recent reports about the possible release of Irish hostage <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Keenan </PERSON> were indirect messages to the Americans and the Britons.'' It did not elaborate. <PERSON> Keenan </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>, holds both Irish and British citizenship. A native of <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Keenan </PERSON> was kidnapped April 11, 1986, as he walked to his teaching job at the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beirut </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Nabih </PERSON> <PERSON> Berri </PERSON>, leader of Amal, said in <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION> after the agreement with <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> was signed on Monday, `` The peace pact did not refer directly to the hostages, but I am sure that this agreement would help -LRB- secure -RRB- the release of hostages as quickly as possible.'' Iranian Foreign Minister <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Akbar </PERSON> <PERSON> Velayati </PERSON>, who negotiated on <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s behalf during the <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION> talks, said: `` Nobody will be satisfied with the holding of the hostages, so we do hope that all the hostages ... will be released.'' <LOCATION> Irish </LOCATION> ambassador <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> McCabe </PERSON> flew in from <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION> last week to investigate reports that <PERSON> Keenan </PERSON>, 38, would be freed. <PERSON> McCabe </PERSON>, who is ambassador to <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, said Wednesday he hoped the statements by <PERSON> Berri </PERSON> and <PERSON> Velayati </PERSON> would result in the release of some foreign captives `` before too long.'' The 15 foreign captives missing in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> are, in addition to <PERSON> Keenan </PERSON> and the Americans, three Britons, an Italian and a Belgian.

 Residents have begun cleaning up from the debris and damage left behind by an railroad explosion and fire that compounded the difficulties of coping with subzero cold. As federal officials began an investigation, many people spent Friday sweeping up glass and assessing the destruction from the blast, which forced 2,000 people to evacuate their homes in temperatures of 30 below zero. <ORGANIZATION> Carroll </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>'s 700 to 800 students remained in temporary lodgings while hundreds of windows in dormitories and classrooms were repaired. Classes were canceled until Feb. 13. Weather forecasters called for a high today of minus 22. The explosion early Thursday shattered windows up to two miles away and knocked out power to half the city for more than six hours. It was caused by 21 runaway railroad freight cars that derailed and crashed. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Spengler </PERSON>, disaster coordinator for <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Clark </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, said the blast site was being examined by investigators from the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Railroad </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> also has announced it will conduct a complete investigation. Federal railroad officials had said the initial explosion was caused when a derailed car hit a propane tank, but that version was questioned Friday. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Bradford </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Louis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dreyfus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Propane </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <PERSON> Helena </PERSON> said both of his company's propane tanks in the area were intact. The propane is used to heat railroad switches. Officials said a rail tank car filled with highly flammable hydrogen peroxide exploded just before 5 a.m., but a second hydrogen peroxide car was quickly coated with ice from firefighters' water, which fire crews believed minimized the danger of it exploding. A load of granular plastic inside one of the rail cars smoldered until it was extinguished Friday afternoon, according to <LOCATION> Spengler </LOCATION>. Only two people were injured in the incident, neither seriously.

<HEAD>Study: Milk Of Canadian Eskimo Women Has Highest PCB Level In World</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MONTREAL (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The milk of nursing Eskimo women in northern <LOCATION> Quebec </LOCATION> has a higher level of PCBs than that of women anywhere in the world, according to a university study published today. PCBs, or polychlorinated biphenyls, have been linked to cancer and skin rashes. The 1987 study at <ORGANIZATION> Laval </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> in </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ste-Foy </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Quebec </LOCATION>, obtained by the daily <ORGANIZATION> Le </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Devoir </ORGANIZATION> newspaper of <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION>, compared 24 samples of milk from <LOCATION> Eskimo </LOCATION> women in northern <LOCATION> Quebec </LOCATION> to that of 48 women from southern <LOCATION> Quebec </LOCATION>, some from an industrial suburb of <LOCATION> Quebec </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> and the rest from <LOCATION> Baie-Comeau </LOCATION> on the shore of the lower St. Lawrence near an aluminum smelter. The fat in the milk of the Eskimo women showed an average PCB concentration of 3.59 parts per million compared to 0.76 for the rest of the samples, the newspaper said. Some Eskimo women had a concentration of 14.7. Health and <ORGANIZATION> Welfare </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Canada </ORGANIZATION>, the federal agency responsible for health regulations, has set a tolerance level of 1.5 parts per million. Eskimo women in northern <LOCATION> Quebec </LOCATION> tend to breast feed their babies for up to 23 months. Their diet for centuries has included large amounts of fish and animal fat. <PERSON> Le </PERSON> <PERSON> Devoir </PERSON> quoted the study as saying an Eskimo child nursed by a mother whose milk has the average amount of <ORGANIZATION> PCB </ORGANIZATION> contamination would have imbibed enough of the toxic chemical within a year to show observable effects such as skin problems, liver complaints and problems with their immune system. Among women whose milk is highly contaminated, such effects might appear after four or five months, the newspaper said. The authors of the study say the PCBs in the area enter the environment from industrial waste poured into rivers and coastal waters and could come from as far away as the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Dewailly </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Laval </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>'s hospital center, who directed research for the study, was quoted as telling <PERSON> Le </PERSON> <PERSON> Devoir </PERSON> that fish in the <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lawrence </LOCATION> river `` are more contaminated than those in the north. `` But we southerners eat a lot less fish than the Inuit -LRB- Eskimo -RRB-,'' he said. The Laval scientists plan to monitor the subjects and their children for the next year, the newspaper said.

<HEAD>President Premadasa Calls For Peace, Revolution To Eliminate Poverty</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PATRICK CRUEZ</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Ranasinghe </PERSON> <PERSON> Premadasa </PERSON> today called for an end to the discord tearing apart this once idyllic island and promised a revolution to usher in social change. <PERSON> Premadasa </PERSON> presided over austere Independence Day celebrations _ part of a plan to save government funds for an anti-poverty program. `` We must terminate ethnic discord,'' he said, so that `` in the years ahead a new revolution will flourish in every hamlet, village and town to eliminate poverty, create an equitable social order and eliminate discrimination.'' <PERSON> Premadasa </PERSON>, 64, who won the Dec. 19 presidential election and took over Jan. 2, has vowed to give monthly payments to 1.4 million families who earn less than the national annual per capita of $ 360. After taking office, he announced a plan to pay poor people $ 75 monthly for two years, beginning in April. About 7 million of <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>'s 16 million people stand to gain. The president has not specified where the funds will come from, though he has urged all government departments to curb expenses. <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>'s independence from <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> in 1948 was commemmorated today by a 100-member honor guard that presented arms to the president. Schoolgirls dressed in white sang during the ceremony in the capital's independence square. The traditional military pageant and parade was absent this year, to save money for <PERSON> Premadasa </PERSON>'s anti-poverty program. Political analysts, however, insist the major hurdle in the <PERSON> Premadasa </PERSON> presidency will be to curb ethnic insurgencies that have torn the island nation apart since 1983. Militants from the Tamil minority, claiming discrimination by the majority <ORGANIZATION> Buddhist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sinhalese </ORGANIZATION>, have waged a bloody insurgency for an independent Tamil nation since 1983. More than 8,500 people have been killed in the 5-year separatist insurgency by militants in the Tamil minority. Extremists from the Sinhalese majority, angered by the government's peace overtures to the Tamils, have killed more than 900 people, mostly government supporters, the past 18 months. The government says <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> has begun to withdraw Indian troops sent here in 1987 to disarm Tamils under terms of a failed peace pact. The Indian troops are estimated at 44,000. Both Tamil and Sinhalese extremists have vowed to violently disrupt parliamentary elections Feb. 15. Speaking in Sinhala, English and Tamil, <PERSON> Premadasa </PERSON> warned, `` Elements who seek to obstruct or destroy the democratic process will not be tolerated by the vast majority of freedom-loving Sri Lankans.'' `` Let us join hands in amity and unity to make our motherland a land of peace and prosperity,'' he said. The Tamils, who are mainly Hindu, make up 18 percent of <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>'s population. They claim discrimination by the mainly Buddhist Sinhalese, who are 75 percent of the population and dominate the government and military.

<HEAD>Calm Restored, But Investigation Continues in Drug Suspect's Death</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TAMPA, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Authorities are investigating the possibility that a black man whose death brought about two nights of violence might have suffocated as he was lying face down and handcuffed in a police car. <PERSON> Edgar </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> <PERSON> Price </PERSON>, 40, of <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>, died following a struggle with police Wednesday night as eight officers tried to arrest the 6-foot-3, 300-pound drug suspect. Dr. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Diggs </PERSON>, assistant <LOCATION> Hillsborough </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> medical examiner, said it appears Price suffocated. `` He is working it as an asphyxiated death,'' said <PERSON> April </PERSON> <PERSON> Strouse </PERSON>, a medical investigator in the medical examiner's office. `` But we do n't know how. We have not been able to determine that yet. There is a very intense investigation going on.'' She said doctors hope to have conclusive results by next week. <PERSON> Diggs </PERSON> said officials were looking at the possibility that Price was in the cruiser when his breathing stopped, adding that he had been deprived of oxygen for some time. Price's death triggered violence Wednesday and, to a lesser extent, Thursday night in <LOCATION> College </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>, a poor depressed, predominantly black neighborhood. One person was arrested Wednesday night and nine Thursday night. There were no disturbances Friday night and police said that no sections of the area were blocked off. The breathing of a person who is intoxicated or stunned, then placed face down in handcuffs on a seat or car floor, can be restricted, <PERSON> Diggs </PERSON> said. Price reportedly had alcohol in his blood. But Ms. <PERSON> Strouse </PERSON>, who would n't confirm whether tests showed Price had been drinking, cautioned, `` There are a lot of things that can cause restricted breathing, and we have to wait until we know for sure.'' Deputy Chief <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> DePolis </PERSON> had said Thursday that preliminary findings showed Price died of a cardiac arrest, but that authorities had not yet determined what caused Price's heart to stop. The findings showed police did not choke or beat Price during the confrontation after an undercover crack cocaine buy, according to Police Chief <PERSON> Austin </PERSON> <PERSON> McLane </PERSON>. Officials, who released the information on Price's death Thursday in an effort to forestall more trouble, said incidents of rock - and bottle-throwing were more sporadic and the young people fewer in number the second night City officials, residents and community leaders continued to discuss the reasons behind the outbreak, which came less than three weeks after three nights of unrest in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> followed the shooting death of a black motorcyclist. A police officer is charged in that incident. `` This is not <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, either in scope or in what touched off the trouble,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Dunn </PERSON>, spokesman for Mayor <PERSON> Sandy </PERSON> <PERSON> Freedman </PERSON>. `` These are teen-agers out there. This was a drug arrest that sparked it. This was not an indiscriminate action on the part of the police department.'' Since an outbreak of violence in 1987 that lasted several days, <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION> authorities have increased efforts to spruce up housing, improve economic opportunities, and fight drug use, which they say is an underlying problem. Price, a convicted felon who served 10 years in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> on a robbery conviction before being paroled in 1984, was carrying 25 pieces of crack cocaine and a loaded .25 - caliber pistol in his pockets, said

<TEXT>
 A judge today struck down objections from Union Carbide and said Hindi, not English, would be the language for court proceedings on the 1984 gas leak that killed more than 3,300 people. `` Our clients do not understand Hindi,'' objected <PERSON> Vijay </PERSON> <PERSON> Gupta </PERSON>, attorney for the <LOCATION> Danbury </LOCATION>, Conn.-based company. `` It will be better if the practice of writing order sheets in English continues.'' Bhopal District Judge N.K. <PERSON> Jain </PERSON> replied: `` The government's clients -LRB- the gas leak victims -RRB- do not understand English. The government of <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> is suing <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carbide </ORGANIZATION> for $ 3 billion in damages for the gas leak that, by the government's count, killed 3,329 people and injured more than 20,000 others. <PERSON> Jain </PERSON> said the two sides can argue their cases in English but the court's order sheet that records the arguments after each hearing will be prepared in <LOCATION> Hindi </LOCATION>. Up until now the arguments had been recorded in English. However, he said judgments will be handed down in English. <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> filed the damage suit in 1985, but the case has bogged down in legal wrangling in a variety of courts. Hindi is the official language of <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, spoken by more than half its 880 million people, especially in north and central <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, where <LOCATION> Bhopal </LOCATION> is located. English also is an official language. The <LOCATION> Bhopal </LOCATION> pesticide plant where the leak of methyl isocyanate gas occurred is owned by the <LOCATION> Indian </LOCATION> subsidiary of <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carbide </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Jain </PERSON> replaced Judge M.W <PERSON> Deo </PERSON> in the case in <LOCATION> Bhopal </LOCATION> district judge after the high court of <LOCATION> Madhya </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pradesh </LOCATION> state ruled last November that <PERSON> Deo </PERSON> was biased against <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carbide </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>Jumbo Jet Diverted Because Of Fear Of Luggage Tampering</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A Toronto-bound jumbo jet with 214 people on board made an emergency landing at <LOCATION> Glasgow </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> after a passenger said she thought someone had tampered with her luggage in the hold, police and airline officials said today. `` It was a false alarm,'' said <LOCATION> Glasgow </LOCATION> Police Inspector <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Nicholson </PERSON>. `` There was a bit of concern, but everything turned out to have a happy ending.'' The British Airways jet took off from <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Heathrow </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> at 4:45 p.m. Friday and had been airborne an hour when a Canadian passenger told a flight attendant she was worried that her checked luggage had been tampered with before she boarded a connecting <ORGANIZATION> BA </ORGANIZATION> flight in <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION>, the airline said. Airline spokesman <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Burchill </PERSON> said the flight attendant informed the captain, who decided to turn back and make an emergency landing. The <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 747 jet was about 30 minutes over the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> at the time and had to dump fuel before touching down in <LOCATION> Glasgow </LOCATION> at 7:45 p.m., he said. After the jet landed, inspector <PERSON> Nicholson </PERSON> said all baggage on the plane was isolated, examined `` and found to be in order.''

 <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Cassavetes </PERSON>, the actor and filmmaker whose innovative, unconventional movies such as `` A Woman Under the Influence'' and `` Faces'' drew both disdain and praise, has died at age 59. <PERSON> Cassavetes </PERSON>, who had been in poor health for three years, died Friday at <ORGANIZATION> Cedars-Sinai </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> of complications resulting from cirrhosis of the liver, said his publicist, <PERSON> Esme </PERSON> <PERSON> Chandlee </PERSON>. At his side was <PERSON> Gena </PERSON> <PERSON> Rowlands </PERSON>, his wife of 30 years and star of many of his films, including `` A Woman Under the Influence,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Chandlee </PERSON>. `` He was one of the most powerful and original filmmakers who ever lived. He broke ground in the way films are made,'' said actor <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Falk </PERSON>, a close friend who appeared with <PERSON> Cassavetes </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Gazarra </PERSON> in the 1969 film `` Husbands'' about three men drunkenly facing their own mortality after the death of a friend. <PERSON> Cassavetes </PERSON>, one of only four entertainers nominated for Academy Awards in three categories, was outspoken about the film industry and never afraid to praise his own work. `` I would put my pictures up against anybody's in this world,'' he said in a 1980 interview. `` Certainly in my own day I bow to no one. I do n't think there's another director in the world who works harder to make better films than I do.'' <PERSON> Cassavetes </PERSON> was nominated as best writer for his original screenplay for `` Faces'' in 1968; as best supporting actor in `` The Dirty Dozen'' in 1967; and as best director for `` A Woman Under the Influence'' in 1974. `` A Woman Under the Influence,'' was his favorite and also his most critically and commercially successful film. It won Miss <PERSON> Rowlands </PERSON> a Golden Globe award as best actress and an Academy Award nomination for best actress. As an actor, one of <PERSON> Cassavetes </PERSON>' best-known roles was in `` <PERSON> Rosemary </PERSON>'s Baby,'' a 1968 film starring <PERSON> Mia </PERSON> <PERSON> Farrow </PERSON>, in which he played the husband of a woman who conceives a baby by the devil. He also starred with <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Rowlands </PERSON>, <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Sarandon </PERSON> and <PERSON> Molly </PERSON> <PERSON> Ringwald </PERSON> in `` Tempest,'' director <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Mazursky </PERSON>'s film adaptation of <PERSON> Shakespeare </PERSON>'s play. <PERSON> Cassavetes </PERSON> made his directorial debut in 1960, when he helmed the well-received `` Shadows,'' an all-improvised `` cinema verite'' movie that borrowed heavily from the French New Wave movement and was produced on a spartan $ 40,000 budget. The movie was about a fair-skinned black girl living in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> with her two brothers. He then directed two <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> films _ `` Too Late Blues'' with <PERSON> Bobby </PERSON> <PERSON> Darin </PERSON> and `` A Child Is Waiting'' with <PERSON> Judy </PERSON> <PERSON> Garland </PERSON> and <PERSON> Burt </PERSON> <PERSON> Lancaster </PERSON>. The failures of those films brought him back to being his own boss, using small film crews and filming on location. <PERSON> Cassavetes </PERSON> was born in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> on Dec. 9, 1929, and grew up poor. His break in acting came when he played a brooding young bullfighter in a production of the old `` Omnibus'' TV series in 1953. That led to TV roles in `` Playhouse 90,'' `` Studio One,'' `` Kraft Theater'' and `` Climax.'' He made his movie debut in `` The Night Holds Terror'' in 1955. <PERSON> Cassavetes </PERSON> and Miss <PERSON> Rowlands </PERSON> were married in March 1958 and their careers were seldom separate after that. They had three children: <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON>, <PERSON> Alexandra </PERSON> and <PERSON> Zoe </PERSON>. Private funeral services were scheduled Monday at Westwood Memorial Park.

 Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> will travel to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> in mid-May to meet <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaoping </PERSON> in the first summit between the world's two largest Communist powers since 1959, it was announced today. Soviet Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> told a news conference he and <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> agreed that `` Soviet and Chinese leaders will precede from the presumption of complete normalization of relations'' between the two countries, putting a formal end to three decades of enmity. <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> said the two nations also agreed to try to reduce offensive forces and ease military tensions along their 5,000-mile border. He said his three days in talks in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, including a meeting with the <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> leader this morning in <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION>, had produced broad agreements on the need for Sino-Soviet efforts to end the 10-year conflict in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> left for <LOCATION> Islamabad </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, where he is to confer today with <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>'s leaders about the Soviet troop withdrawal from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> and the prospects for a peace in that nation. `` It is our common task now to make sure to contribute to ending the bloodshed, to contribute to ending the hostilities and to contribute to the development of dialogue between the Afghans,'' he said. <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> said he and <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> agreed that the first summit since <PERSON> Nikita </PERSON> <PERSON> Khrushchev </PERSON> met <PERSON> Mao </PERSON> <PERSON> Tse-tung </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> in 1959 will occur sometime in the middle of May. Soviet sources said the tentative date was May 15. <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> quoted <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> as saying the summit will `` close the page on the past and open up a chapter of the future.'' <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> split over ideological and strategic differences in 1960. They fought a brief border war in 1969 and more recently have been divided over the Soviet intervention in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> and their heavily militarized common border. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> last year agreed to begin talking about a Soviet-proposed summit after <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> announced plans to withdraw Soviet troops from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> and reduce Soviet troop strength in <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>. On Friday, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> formally invited <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> to visit, and <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> accepted on the Soviet leader's behalf. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, financial backer of <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, now agrees with <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, supporter of the anti-Vietnamese resistance in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>, on the need for <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> to end its military occupation. <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> said <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> agree on almost all external aspects _ such as ending arms shipments to the warring Cambodian factions after a political settlement is reached. <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> said he proposed that diplomatic and military experts begin drafting an agreement on reducing military forces along the Sino-Soviet frontier. He said the experts could begin meeting before the summit, and `` we hope at the summit we will be able to make progress in that important direction.'' The foreign minister said the two sides might initially agree on advance notice for troop movements and military exercises, and progress to the more difficult issues of disbanding offensive forces. Normalization, the Soviet official said, will extend to long-severed party ties. He envisioned increased contacts in trade, science, protection of the environment and exploration of outer space. He said normal ties are directly linked with Soviet `` perestroika,'' or economic restructuring, and Chinese efforts to modernize its economy. <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>, who flew to <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION>, 870 miles south of <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, for the meeting with <PERSON> Deng </PERSON>, said <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s senior leader was `` a very wise man who has a lot of rich experience.'' He earlier held met with Foreign Minister <PERSON> Qian </PERSON> <PERSON> Qichen </PERSON> and Premier <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Peng </PERSON>.

<HEAD>Global Temperature Was Warmest In 1988, 1980s Hotter Than Normal</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The average global temperature last year was the warmest of the century, and six of the 20th century's hottest years have occurred in the 1980s, a British study said. Meteorological officials, however, said it was too early to conclusively blame the greenhouse effect where heat from the sun is trapped in the atmosphere by gases acting like the glass walls in a greenhouse. `` While a warming of this amount is consistent with the greenhouse effect caused by the rise in the levels of carbon dioxide and other man-made gases in the atmosphere, the earth's temperature fluctuates considerably due to natural causes and no unambigious connection can yet be made,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Parker </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Meterological </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Bracknell </LOCATION> Their work showed that 1988's global average temperature was 57.2 degrees Fahrenheit, 0.5 degrees higher than the 30-year global average ending in 1979. Since 1979, the succession of tiny increases has been too steady for the weathermen to ignore, <PERSON> Parker </PERSON> said. The six warmest years in the century have all been in this decade, he said. They were 1988, 1987, 1983, 1981, 1980 and 1986, in descending order of warmth. Global temperatures have risen by about 0.8 degrees since the beginning of the century, <PERSON> Parker </PERSON> said. It could take 20 years of temperature rises before the greenhouse effect could be detected with much certainty, he said in a recent interview. The apparent warming trend was revealed in analyses of global weather records by the <ORGANIZATION> Meteorological </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> East </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Anglia </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Norwich </LOCATION>, southeast <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> has had a mild winter, with temperatures averaging 5 degrees above the normal temperature of 40 degrees in December and January. Spring flowers are shooting up and blooming. The debate over whether there is a greenhouse effect has been fueled by unusual weather patterns in recent years, including a serious drought in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> last summer. Last week, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> scientists said they could find no evidence of any overall temperature increases for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> from 1895 to 1987. But they stressed that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> makes up only 6 percent of the earth's surface.

 A reputed Japanese <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> terrorist who was convicted of transporting explosives was intending to use them to blow up a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> recruiting station in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, prosecutors say. Government attorneys, charging that <PERSON> Yu </PERSON> <PERSON> Kikumura </PERSON> has ties to a Libyan-directed terrorist conspiracy, asked a judge Friday to sentence him to a lengthy prison term. However, defense attorneys said the government's pre-sentence report makes only `` tenuous'' ties between their client and other terrorist incidents worldwide. <PERSON> Kikumura </PERSON>, 36, faces up to 100 years in prison when he is sentenced Monday. In papers filed in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, the government revealed that <PERSON> Kikumura </PERSON> planned to blow up a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> recruiting station in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> in conjunction with a USO club bombing April 14, 1988, in <LOCATION> Naples </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Alito </PERSON> asked Judge <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lechner </PERSON> to help deter terrorism by sending <PERSON> Kikumura </PERSON> to prison `` at least until he is so old that he is no longer physically capable of building and planting bombs or assisting with terrorist plots.'' The <LOCATION> Naples </LOCATION> blast came on the second anniversary of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> air strike against <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> and two days after <PERSON> Kikumura </PERSON> was arrested on the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Turnpike </LOCATION> with three 18-inch pipe bombs in his car. Each bomb, manufactured from a fire extinguisher, gunpowder and lead shot, could destroy an average-size building, authorities said. <PERSON> Kikumura </PERSON>, who is alleged to be a member of the terrorist <ORGANIZATION> Japanese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, was arrested last April 12 and convicted Nov. 29 on charges of illegally transporting explosives, possession of firearms by an alien, possession of unregistered firearms and carrying false travel documents. Sources have said the government believed other potential targets may have been the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> building or <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>'s garment district. The pre-sentence report does not mention either site. <PERSON> Alito </PERSON> also said a map of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> found in <LOCATION> Kikumura </LOCATION>'s car had marks that indicated only the recruitment center as the target. The <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> reported Friday that the government had evidence proving all three sites were targets of Kikumura. Defense attorneys <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Kuby </PERSON> and <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Kunstler </PERSON> said in their pre-sentence report that `` the ` linkages' it -LRB- the prosecution -RRB- attempts to make between <LOCATION> Kikumura </LOCATION> and others are as tenuous as they are inflammatory.''

 Authorities might seek the death penalty against a man accused of fatally stabbing his girlfriend, their two children and her mother, and then setting their house on fire. `` A death penalty count is certainly a possibility with a multiple killing like this,'' said <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Prosecutor <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Crawford </PERSON>. <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Roarke </PERSON>, 25, was charged Friday with four preliminary counts of murder and was being held without bond.

 Relatives of some of the 259 people who died on a <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> jet that crashed in <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION> are banding together to criticize the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government for its handling of the tragedy. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON>, a lawyer whose 16-year-old daughter, <PERSON> Melina </PERSON>, died in the crash, said the families are `` outraged ... at the policy of utter silence that has apparently been decided upon by the federal government.'' <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON> said at least a dozen family members intend to hold a news conference Monday in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> to discuss their criticisms. He said the relatives believe the government should release details of the crash investigation to them. <PERSON> Lynne </PERSON> <PERSON> Fraidowitz </PERSON>, whose son, <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosenthal </PERSON>, 20, was among the dead, told The <ORGANIZATION> Syracuse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post-Standard </ORGANIZATION> that she would press the government for information until `` I'm satisfied _ we're satisfied _ that we have the truth.'' `` This is just the beginning,'' she said. `` We're not going to let a wash go down. If we're not satisfied, we're going to do something else. ... My son is dead. All I have is a hole in the ground. I owe my son a reckoning.'' Among those killed Dec. 21 were 35 students enrolled in <ORGANIZATION> Syracuse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>'s overseas studies program. In addition to the 259 people aboard the plane, 11 residents of <LOCATION> Lockerbie </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>, also were killed when the jet smashed into a row of houses. Investigators have determined that the crash was caused by a bomb that was smuggled aboard Flight 103 in <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. The plane later stopped in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> and was on its way to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> when the bomb went off. A <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official declined to comment on the families' accusations, saying department officials wanted to hear the charges at the news conference first Meanwhile, a Scottish community worker has announced plans to establish a scholarship fund that would allow <LOCATION> Lockerbie </LOCATION> students to attend <ORGANIZATION> Syracuse </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Hume </PERSON> said the fund would be a `` living memorial'' to the victims of the crash. <PERSON> Hume </PERSON>, who has arranged support services for residents of <LOCATION> Lockerbie </LOCATION> since the crash, said he wants the fund to be taken from an existing relief fund, the <ORGANIZATION> Lockerbie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disaster </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeal </ORGANIZATION>, which has already raised $ 2.2 million. `` If the money could be used for something long-lasting, a living thing where people actually exchange part of their culture and friendship ... some happiness can come out of it,'' <PERSON> Hume </PERSON> said.

 Officials today released a carpenter who was arrested for communist activities and held for 11 years without trial, an opposition member of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> said. <PERSON> Cheah </PERSON> <PERSON> Swee </PERSON> <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> was released from the <LOCATION> Kamunting </LOCATION> detention camp, 120 miles north of the capital, after being held under <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION>'s Internal Security Act, said <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Lam </PERSON> <PERSON> Thye </PERSON>, secretary-general of the opposition <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>, in a statement, urged the release of other detainees held under the act, including opposition parliamentary leader Lim Kit Siang. <PERSON> Cheah </PERSON>, 40, was arrested for communist subversive activities. The banned <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Malaysia </ORGANIZATION> has 1,500 guerrillas fighting from the jungles mainly along the <LOCATION> Thailand-Malaysia </LOCATION> border. <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>, who is a member of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, called on the government to release <PERSON> Lim </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lim </PERSON>'s son, <PERSON> Lim </PERSON> <PERSON> Guan </PERSON> <PERSON> Eng </PERSON>, who have been in jail without trial under the Internal Security Act since October 1987. The two, both members of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, are the only remaining prisoners of 106 political leaders ordered arrested in 1987 by Prime Minister <PERSON> Mahathir </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohamad </PERSON>, who claimed their actions and speeches were increasing racial tensions between the Malays and Chinese. <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> said about 64 people overall are still being held without trial under the Internal Security Act. About 550 were detained when <PERSON> Mahathir </PERSON> became prime minister in 1981. <PERSON> Mahathir </PERSON> called for a review and released most of them. In December, <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> criticized the act, which empowers authorities to order preventive detention without trial for activities deemed extremely and imminently dangerous to the state and the public. The London-based human rights group said the act fails to state clear criteria for identifying such activities, and authorities have not distinguished between violent activities that threaten national security and non-violent activities that do not involve such a threat. Amnesty requested a review of the security act. Malaysian laws are `` seriously inadequate'' to safeguard against arbitrary arrest, detention without trial, torture or other degrading treatment, it said.

<TEXT>
 Several ultraleftist groups have formed an alliance aimed at disrupting the funeral of Emperor <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>, a radical leader said today. <PERSON> Yoshihisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Fujiwara </PERSON> said in an interview that his group `` is in a common front'' with three other major ultraleftist organizations. Speaking with The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> at the heavily fortified headquarters of his <ORGANIZATION> Middle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Core </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Faction </ORGANIZATION>, he said the alliance is planning guerrilla activities to disrupt <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>'s funeral on Feb. 24. He said the alliance includes the <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, a group of revolutionaries linked by police to more than a dozen incidents since <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>'s health deteriorated in September <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> died of cancer on Jan. 7. Police believe the Middle Core Faction and the <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, are <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s largest ultraleftist groups. Police say the Marxist-Leninist faction has between 3,000 and 5,000 members, while the <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> has hundreds of members. <PERSON> Fujiwara </PERSON> said the other two groups in the front are the Battle Flag Faction and the Insurrection Faction. Police estimate the Battle Flag Faction membership to be in the hundreds but are unclear about size of the Insurrection Faction. <PERSON> Fujiwara </PERSON> refused to estimate the size of any of the groups, including his own. At least half a dozen radical groups have threatened to disrupt <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>'s funeral, which will be attended by dignitaries from over 130 nations, including President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and Prince <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. More than 30,000 police will be mobilized to ensure their safety. Ultraleftists claim the monarchy supports Japanese imperialism, and they are protesting the state funeral because they say <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> should be treated as a war criminal for his role in World War II. <PERSON> Fujiwara </PERSON>, who described himself as a `` ranking member'' of the <ORGANIZATION> Middle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Core </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Faction </ORGANIZATION>, refused to say whether <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is being singled out as a target but said the American leader's attendance at the funeral `` is inexcusable.'' The faction, seen by police as a serious threat to funeral security, is believed to have the capability of firing missiles more than 2 -LCB- miles. After the 1986 <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> summit of industrialized nations, it claimed responsibility for launching missiles that overshot a state guest house where Western leaders were meeting. `` It is natural to assume that our technology has improved since then,'' <PERSON> Fujiwara </PERSON> said. He refused to elaborate.

In a private meeting with top military leaders, he used direct language reminiscent of a similar mission in 1983 by then Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, according to officials who attended. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had told the Salvadorans to improve their human rights record or face loss of further aid. `` <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> was very emphatic in describing the bipartisan consensus'' in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> that has led to $ 3 billion in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid to <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> during this decade, said one <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> explained that the consensus `` is of necessity a very fragile thing, and that sliding back on the human rights questions would threaten it.'' The vice president tried `` to tell them the facts of life in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>,'' the official said. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> also met in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> with the two leading candidates to succeed <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON> as president, and with labor and business leaders, as well as Archbishop <PERSON> Arturo </PERSON> <PERSON> Rivera </PERSON> <PERSON> y </PERSON> <PERSON> Dama </PERSON>. Stopping in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> after two days in <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION> for that country's presidential inauguration, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> had lunch with <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON> and several government officials. He offered a toast in which he praised <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON> as a champion of human rights and repeatedly stressed <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> commitment to that cause. `` Why I am here today is to reiterate in the strongest terms possible our commitment to democracy and the advancement of human rights,'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> told reporters in a news conference later. `` There are consequences to human rights violations in the future.'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> commitment and support for <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, he said, `` is conditioned on advancing democracy and human rights.'' Human rights abuses, including killing of civilians by right-wing death squads, were rampant in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> in the early 1980s. The situation calmed down considerably after 1984, but in the past year violence by both left and right-wing factions has picked up again. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> arrived amid tight security at a time when the wartorn Central American nation is preparing for its March 19 presidential election. The rebels' <ORGANIZATION> Farabundo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marti </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, or <ORGANIZATION> FMLN </ORGANIZATION>, proposed in a peace plan Jan. 23 to postpone the election until September. In the strongest <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> statement to date on the peace proposal, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> called it `` a step forward.'' The rebels for the first time ever are offering to participate in the elections if certain conditions are met, including the postponement. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said `` I'm sure there would be strong support from the administration'' should <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON> decide he has a national consensus to agree to the postponement.

 <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> accused <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> of committing a military provocation today by sending four warships into the North's territorial waters The North's official <ORGANIZATION> Korean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, monitored in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, said the ships sailed deep into its waters off <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s western coast before turning south when a North Korean patrol boat approached The report did not say whether any shots were fired. It was the third reported incident between the two nations in eight days. A North Korean patrol boat seized two <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> fishing boats in the <LOCATION> Yellow </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> on Jan. 28. On Friday, the <PERSON> North </PERSON> said <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> troops fired on a North Korean guard post in the demilitarized zone separating the countries. The North Korean news agency said the alleged warship intrusion was a `` premeditated and deliberate military provocation aimed at pushing the situation on the <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> peninsula to an extreme pitch of strain.'' <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> `` must immediately desist from all ... hostile acts aggravating the situation, which runs counter to the <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> people's desire for reunification and to the global trend toward universal detente,'' it said Another agency report today said <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> would send five delegates to the truce village of <LOCATION> Panmunjom </LOCATION> on Wednesday for negotiations with <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> over arrangements for talks between the nations. The Koreas have agreed to talks between their prime ministers on easing military tension and achieving reunification of the divided peninsula.

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A Soviet newspaper said about 40 million people were arrested, executed or otherwise repressed under <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>, and it gave the most detailed breakdown of his victims ever reported in the official press. The tabloid's figures indicate up to 15 million of those people died as a result of the dictator's policies. Western historians, who also include estimates of farmers believed to have died after they were forced from their land, put the number at 20 million. About 20 million Soviets are estimated to have died in World War II. The figures were not new for Western readers, but their appearance in this week's Arguments and Facts, whose circulation is 20 million, marked a new attempt to fill in what Soviets call `` blank spots'' in their history. Historian <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Medvedev </PERSON> gave the 40 million figure in an interview with the newspaper and said it included all `` victims of Stalinism.'' He said he based the number on his own calculations of the number arrested, executed and otherwise punished. The figure is much higher than the vague estimate previously on the official record. Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said in a November 1987 speech that `` many thousands of people ... were subjected to wholesale repressive measures'' under <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>. Western historians believe that about 20 million Soviets died under <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>, who ruled from 1924-1953. In the new report, the Soviet historian wrote that 6-7 million were killed in the famine of the early 1930s, 5-7 million were executed or died in labor camps during mass arrests in the late 1930s, and 1 million died in forced relocations of ethnic minorities during World War II. Also today, the daily <ORGANIZATION> Sovietskaya </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rossiya </ORGANIZATION> reported that a mass grave had been discovered in <LOCATION> Gorno-Altai </LOCATION>, 1,900 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. It said construction workers found the human remains, including 50 skulls of men ages 30 to 50 who were shot in the head. The report said a Stalin-era prison camp had been located in the region and that authorities could not yet guess at how many people were buried there. <ORGANIZATION> Sovietskaya </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rossiya </ORGANIZATION> suggested the mass gravesite was similar to one found last year in <LOCATION> Kuropaty </LOCATION>, an area of the Byelorussian republic. Authorities say <PERSON> Kuropaty </PERSON> was used as a graveyard for at least 30,000 people killed from 1937 to 1941 under <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>, apparently for political reasons. In the Arguments and Facts article, <PERSON> Medvedev </PERSON> gave this breakdown for <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>'s victims: _ From 1927-1929, about 1 million Soviets, mostly former members of political opposition groups and figures in Soviet founder <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lenin </PERSON>'s New Economic Policy, were in jails or exile _ From 1930-1932, nine to 11 million peasants were deported to <LOCATION> Siberia </LOCATION> and other remote regions or fled to cities At least 1 million more peasants were deported in 1933. _ From 1932-1933, 6 million to 7 million people died in a famine blamed on <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>'s agricultural policies _ About 1.5 million to 2 million other peasants were arrested for violating various `` extremely cruel'' laws on state property _ In 1935, 1 million former officials, merchants and nobelmen were branded `` class strangers'' and deported from <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> and other cities _ During 1937-1938, 5 million to 7 million people were arrested in the `` Great Terror. Of them, 1 million were sentenced to death and the rest sent to labor camps, where most died. _ Mass repressions struck 1 million people from 1939-1941 in the <LOCATION> Baltic </LOCATION> republics and the western sections of the <LOCATION> Ukraine </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Byelorussia </LOCATION> _ During World War II, up to 2 million ethnic Germans were deported About 3 million Moslems were forced to move. One million of those deported died. _ After 1940, 2 million to 3 million people were arrested for reporting late to work, a crime punishable by up to five years in a labor camp _ From 10 million to 12 million Soviets were deprived of certain rights or sent to labor camps because they lived in areas the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION> occupied during the war _ After the war, from 1946 to 1953, from 1 million to 1.5 million people were arrested for political reasons <PERSON> Medvedev </PERSON> was expelled from the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> in 1969, and his major works on <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>'s repression and other topics were banned from publication. Under <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> policy of glasnost or more openness, <PERSON> Medvedev </PERSON> is back in favor and has been quoted frequently in the official press.

 Soviet troops will complete their withdrawal from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> in four days, a senior <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> official was quoted as saying today. `` As promised, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> is evacuating its troops from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. Within four days, there will be no Soviet forces in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>,'' Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister <PERSON> Yuli </PERSON> <PERSON> Vorontsov </PERSON> was quoted as saying by <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s official <ORGANIZATION> Tehran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Voronstov </PERSON>, who also is the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION>'s ambassador to <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>, spoke after he arrived in <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>. The broadcast was monitored in <LOCATION> Nicosia </LOCATION>. Under an accord signed last year in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>, all Soviet troops are due to be out of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> by Feb. 15. <PERSON> Vorontsov </PERSON>'s remarks indicated the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> wanted the pullout completed ahead of the deadline. The radio said <PERSON> Vorontsov </PERSON> would discuss with Iranian officials and <LOCATION> Afghan </LOCATION> resistance leaders the future of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> after the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>'s evacuation. <PERSON> Vorontsov </PERSON> said, `` At this juncture, it is necessary to discuss ways of positive reconstruction of that country. It is necessary that its neighbors exchange views on the future of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>.'' `` But of course the future of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> concerns only the Afghan people,'' he stressed. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> intervened in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> in 1979 to prop up its Marxist government. At one point the Soviets had about 115,000 troops there. The official <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, also monitored in <LOCATION> Nicosia </LOCATION>, quoted <PERSON> Vorontsov </PERSON> today as discounting reports of a possible military coup by hard-line <LOCATION> Afghan </LOCATION> officers after the Soviet pullout. `` There are numerous rumors about <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, but there is no such possibility and it is thoroughly baseless,'' he was quoted as saying.

 Israeli soldiers shot and killed two <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> teen-agers today during clashes with stone-throwers in a refugee camp in the occupied <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, the military said. At least 23 Palestinians and a <ORGANIZATION> Swiss </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> worker were shot and wounded in riots in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> and the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, an Arab reporter and hospital officials said. The army said only 16 were wounded. The dead boys were identified as 15-year-old <PERSON> Allah </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdullah </PERSON> <PERSON> Arandez </PERSON> and 16-year-old <PERSON> Maged </PERSON> <PERSON> Jawdat </PERSON> <PERSON> Ihlak </PERSON>. The Arab reporter said both were shot in the chest during protests in the <PERSON> Khan </PERSON> <PERSON> Younis </PERSON> refugee camp. Since the uprising against Israeli rule of the occupied lands began 14 months ago, 373 Palestinians and 15 Israelis have been killed. A military official confirmed today's deaths, but said <PERSON> Arandez </PERSON> was 24 and not 15 as reported by the hospital. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the troops were forced to fire after a group of women and masked youths surrounded their lookout point in the refugee camp and threw rocks. The incident was under investigation, the official said. <PERSON> Arandez </PERSON>'s family took his body from the camp hospital and quickly arranged a funeral, which was followed by a protest march through the camp. <PERSON> Arandez </PERSON> was the second member of his family to be killed in the uprising, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> reporters said. His brother, 26-year-old <PERSON> Sabri </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdullah </PERSON>, was shot and killed in November, they said. In the clashes with troops that followed the funeral, 20 Palestinians were shot and wounded, including <PERSON> Ihlak </PERSON>, who died in the operating room, said refugee camp hospital officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity. The wounded also included four teen-age girls and a 25-year-old man who was in critical condition, the officials said. <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonin </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Swiss </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> worker, was shot in the leg after arriving at the <PERSON> Khan </PERSON> <PERSON> Younis </PERSON> camp to help arrange the evacuation of wounded, said <PERSON> Frederick </PERSON> <PERSON> Maurice </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and the occupied areas. <PERSON> Antonin </PERSON> had followed ambulances into the camp and was negotiating with troops about evacuations when more riots broke out, <PERSON> Maurice </PERSON> said. `` He was in between the soldiers and the protesters. ... There was also tear gas, and it was very difficult to see what was going on. There was stone throwing on one side of the street and shooting on the other,'' <PERSON> Maurice </PERSON> said. `` It was a bit of a mess.'' He said the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> has not decided whether to file a complaint with the Israeli army. `` It's possible an accident happened,'' he said. The army imposed a curfew on the camp and ordered all 35,000 residents to remain at home, an Arab reporter said. In other clashes, four Palestinians were wounded in the <LOCATION> Dir </LOCATION> <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Balah </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Rafah </LOCATION> refugee camps in the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> and in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> town of <LOCATION> Kalkilya </LOCATION>, hospital officials said.

The $ 150 black robe was taken Jan. 25 as <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> lunched with the sheriff, district attorney and other court personnel. He last saw it hanging in a lounge between the courtroom and the judge's chambers. Two other judges' robes hanging nearby were not taken. `` It was one of the better-looking robes,'' said sheriff's Capt. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Russell </PERSON>.

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> faces a grim task that may prove more vexing than flooding the world with cars or cracking the computer chip market: having a good time. Although older Japanese cling to the work ethic that rocketed this country from World War II devastation to economic superpower status, their children have decided all work and no play made <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> a dull nation. <PERSON> Shoko </PERSON> <PERSON> Shima </PERSON>, 31, works 45 hours a week as a translator, about average for the Japanese. But she also takes time to work out regularly at a health club and play tennis and golf. `` People used to work for work's sake or their family's sake. But now many of us work to have free time,'' Ms. <PERSON> Shima </PERSON> said. `` More and more young people are choosing part-time jobs so they can work when they want instead of being tied to a big company.'' In some ways, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> today is a nation bent on enjoying itself: the number of official holidays surpasses that of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, and young people's vision of the future does not include working grueling hours and blind loyalty to a company. `` Many people today say their hobby is work, and the older ones especially say it with a sense of pride,'' said <PERSON> Sumiko </PERSON> <PERSON> Iwao </PERSON>, a psychologist who teaches at <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Keio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. `` But younger people today are saying ` No, that's not my cup of tea.''' `` In the future, productivity will decline, but that's not bad because it is much better for Japanese to enjoy life and relax than just work all the time,'' Ms. <PERSON> Iwao </PERSON> said. But the old ways continue, especially in the highly charged business world. `` If you want to succeed in business in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, you still have to work from 9 to 9,'' Ms. <PERSON> Shima </PERSON> said. The average Japanese worked 2,150 hours in 1986 _ about 225 hours more than Americans and almost 500 more than West Germans, according to <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> statistics. In 1987, the Japanese figure edged up by 18 hours. The government embraced the idea of a five-day workweek in 1985, partly to reduce big trade surpluses. More leisure time, the theory goes, would equal increased spending on imports, an expansion of recreational industry, more domestic spending. But no one said it would be easy. Office worker <PERSON> Kayoko </PERSON> <PERSON> Kumagai </PERSON>, 41, divides her free time between household chores, bowling and working out at her health club. But her 37-year-old husband, a company worker, `` just lies around the house'' on his one day off a week, she said. Like most Japanese, <PERSON> Kumagai </PERSON> has grown used to working six days a week with only Sundays off. `` Not many people realize they are working too much. They take it for granted,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Kumagai </PERSON>. She counts her husband among them, and added, `` My husband would n't be able to figure out what to do if he had weekends off.'' When the government announced plans to give about 58 percent of public servants two Saturdays off a month, people complained they could no longer pay taxes, apply for travel visas or visit the national library every Saturday. The so-called `` twin holidays'' went into effect Jan. 14. Financial institutions went to a five-day workweek Feb. 1, and the government hopes other businesses will follow suit. It has targeted 1993 for a uniform five-day workweek. Meanwhile, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> is creating more leisure time by expanding the number of official holidays from 12 in 1988 to 13 this year, well ahead of the 10 holidays a year enjoyed by some Americans. `` The Japanese find ` vacant time' excruciatingly difficult, and come nowhere near enjoying its advantages,'' wrote former government official <PERSON> Taichi </PERSON> <PERSON> Sakaiya </PERSON> in the daily <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>. Japanese tend to hustle even on vacation, <PERSON> Sakaiya </PERSON> noted: `` An overwhelming number of Japanese prefer the quickie type of package tour such as five European cities in eight days.'' Today, sports, travel and relaxing at home with videos, stereos and computers are the most common ways Japanese spend their leisure time, a change from a few years ago when the majority in a survey said sleeping was their favorite pastime away from work.

 <PERSON> Azaldin </PERSON>, a schoolteacher from the eastern city of <LOCATION> Ghazni </LOCATION>, says he does n't care who rules his ravaged country, as long as the fighting stops. He is typical of many Afghans who have braved a decade of brutal fighting between communist forces and Moslem rebels called mujahedeen. <ORGANIZATION> Mujahedeen </ORGANIZATION> leaders, the seven most powerful of whom are based in <LOCATION> Peshawar </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, are fighting for an Islamic republic of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> but so far have failed to agree on how to slice any postwar political pie. `` They have had no unity,'' said <PERSON> Azaldin </PERSON>, 37, who uses just one name. `` Each of them wants power. But seven kings or presidents in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> is impossible.'' <PERSON> Fazle </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON>, an elderly merchant who sells spices and grain from a grimy adobe shop in this small settlement, says he does n't know one guerrilla chief from another `` We do n't know much about them. We follow the local mujahedeen commanders,'' he said. <PERSON> Fazle </PERSON> said his sympathy for the guerrillas forced him to abandon his original shop in the communist-held center of <LOCATION> Ghazni </LOCATION>, about 75 miles southwest of the Afghan capital. With the Feb. 15 deadline for the final Soviet troop withdrawal from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> drawing near, mujahedeen political leaders have been trying to reach a political consensus. They have tentative plans for a Feb. 10 `` shura,'' or consultative council to convene in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, but its composition remains uncertain. Invitees include representatives of rebels based in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. These guerrillas belong to the Shiite Moslem sect, which comprises about 17 percent of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s population. The majority of Afghans are Sunnis, as are the Pakistan-based rebel groups. Both sides have yet to agree on their proportional representation in the council. The shura's main task is to name a transitional government that can step into power if the guerrillas topple the ruling <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Afghanistan </ORGANIZATION> <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Zai </PERSON>, a 78-year-old former farmer who now runs errands for the guerrillas, says that for him, politics plays second to peace. `` For me, it's not a problem of who it is who leads <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, as long as the people like him and choose him,'' <PERSON> Zai </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Fazle </PERSON> said that if individual guerrilla leaders make a grab for power after the Soviet withdrawal, they will get little support from battle-weary Afghans. `` We just want an Islamic government,'' he said. `` We did n't fight for anybody but God, Islam and our country Even our small children understand this.''

 Diplomatic and political sources have linked the new president, Gen. <PERSON> Andres </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON>, with drug traffickers and cast doubt on his pledge to lead <LOCATION> Paraguay </LOCATION> into a new era of democracy. <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON>, who led the bloody coup that ousted President <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON> on Thursday, was sworn in as president Friday. <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON>, who held the No. 2 position in the military and was considered a strong <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON> ally, immediately promised democratic reforms and more human rights protections, but he failed to provide details. The coup leader had no comment today on <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON>'s fate. On Thursday, he gave the 76-year-old <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON> 12 hours to leave <LOCATION> Paraguay </LOCATION>, a deadline that apparently passed unenforced. He apparently remained under house arrest. `` The new president finds himself in a very difficult situation'' because of his professional and personal ties to <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON>, an opposition political leader said today. <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON>'s daughter is married to <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON>'s son, and the generals share two grandchildren. `` Aside from the strictly political question, this involves family ties,'' the leader said on condition of anonymity. Up to 200 soldiers, mostly <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON> loyalists, were killed in battles with <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON>'s troops beginning Thursday night, according to estimates from <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Caritas </ORGANIZATION>. The government and hospital officials have refused to comment on the death toll. By Friday afternoon, <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Paraguay </LOCATION>'s president and army commander-in-chief for 34 years, was under arrest, <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> was sworn as the new president, the armed forces proclaimed loyalty to him, and the population was quiet. Not even the staunchly pro-Stroessner wing of the ruling <ORGANIZATION> Colorado </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> rallied to <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON>'s side. In addition to <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON>, about 30 of his followers were arrested. There was no word of their fate today. Unconfirmed reports said Friday that <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON> was going to <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION>. Gen. <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Mardones </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Santiago </LOCATION> police commander, said he believed <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON> was leaving <LOCATION> Paraguay </LOCATION> today, `` but we do not know where to. Not necessarily <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> initially was enthusiastically endorsed by opposition leaders who hoped he would offer them a political opening that <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON> and the militant wing of his party did not. But academics, foreign observers, and even some Paraguayan leaders already are hinting at a dark side of <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON>. `` He has an exceedingly unsavory reputation,'' <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoyt </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, a professor of Latin American history at <ORGANIZATION> Indiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> in </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Terre </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Haute </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Ind. </LOCATION>, told the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>. `` I mean really bad, and that's an understatement ... <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> reportedly has provided protection, air fields and an air taxi service to people smuggling drugs northward,'' <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> Cox </ORGANIZATION> newspaper group, citing a classified <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> report, said on Friday that <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> is considered by law enforcement authorities in <LOCATION> Paraguay </LOCATION> to be the country's No. 1 drug trafficker. A Western diplomat in <LOCATION> Asuncion </LOCATION>, speaking on condition of anonymity, said today that reports are common in <LOCATION> Paraguay </LOCATION> that <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> allows cocaine traffickers to use an airstrip he owns in deserted Chaco Province along the border with <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION>. However, he added, `` Absolutely no proof of that has ever been offered.'' <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON>, the son of a small-scale farmer, definitely lives better than his army salary would seem to allow. His house in a plush neighborhood is a mansion with a fountain in the well-manicured front yard. In his biography, `` <LOCATION> Paraguay </LOCATION> Under <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON>,'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> academic <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> said <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> made his fortune from the whisky and cigarette concessions in the early 1960s. It claims he later turned bigger profits by allowing his extensive property near <LOCATION> Asuncion </LOCATION> to be used for drug-trafficking airstrips. White House spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>, asked about <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> reports of <PERSON> Rodriquez </PERSON>'s alleged drug ties, told reporters, `` We wo n't characterize our relationship to him at this point. However, <LOCATION> Paraguay </LOCATION>'s new leader has vowed to press for democracy and `` respect the human rights of everyone to make democracy a reality.'' Several thousand citizens cheered <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON>, five rows of medals on his shirtfront, as he took the oath of office in the 19th century National Palace. But <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON>, commander of the powerful <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION>, said nothing about elections nor how long his presidency would last. The coup was provoked when <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON>, who has been reported in poor health since prostate surgery five months ago, tried to force <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> into retirement. The dictator's recent shakeups of the army also caused widespread resentment among his officers. <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON>, who took power by coup in 1954, tortured and killed opponents during his early years in power, human rights groups said. Others were jailed indefinitely, convicted of political crimes or forced into exile. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government labeled his government a dictatorship in 1986. Under his rule, <LOCATION> Paraguay </LOCATION> became a haven for fugitive Nazis, drug traffickers and former dictators. Among the refugees were <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> Mengele </PERSON>, the doctor at the <LOCATION> Auschwitz </LOCATION> death camp, and ousted President <PERSON> Anastasio </PERSON> <PERSON> Somoza </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>North Trial Judge Called Stern, Smart, Fair, Not Lacking In Confidence</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ROWLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Well before <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s trial got under way in Courtroom 6, Judge <PERSON> Gerhard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> asked how long it would last, telling lawyers `` far more important matters'' awaited his attention. Sparring from the bench with defense lawyers and prosecutors alike, the energetic 78-year-old federal district judge obviously relishes the limelight and legal challenges posed by the first criminal trial in the Iran-Contra affair. But despite the national attention given the case, <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> took pains at the Jan. 9 hearing to remind the lawyers that he will treat it like just another criminal matter on his crowded docket. `` It has become increasingly urgent for me to know how long this case is going to take,'' <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> said at the hearing. `` There are a substantial number of litigants with _ I think _ far more important matters pending who want to be heard. `` I've got all kinds of problems in terms of the work of the court as an institution,'' said <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON>, who unlike most judges his age has refused to take a reduced caseload by going on `` senior status.'' Told the trial could last four or five months, <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> replied, `` It will be a wonderful summer.'' Highly regarded for his intellect and ability to conduct a difficult trial, <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> is known among <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> lawyers as being impatient with slipshod pleadings and arguments. `` You better be prepared, but he gives you a fair hearing on everything,'' said attorney <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON>, a former bar association president who has tried a number of civil cases before <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON>. Others note a touch of intellectual arrogance in <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON>, the son of a noted <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> child psychologist. `` Sometimes wrong, never in doubt,'' said one attorney, echoing _ on condition of anonymity _ a sentiment expressed by other colleagues in the local bar. `` He does a lot of thinking out loud, a sign of self-confidence of which he is not lacking.'' <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON>'s habit of expressing his thoughts from the bench has sent many a reporter scurrying to the telephone with excited accounts about the judge's latest doubts about the future of the Iran-Contra case. At the outset of jury selection, <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> said the difficulty finding prospective jurors who had no knowledge of <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s immunized congressional testimony raised questions about `` the triability of the case.'' Yet after five days, the judge managed to find 32 prospective jurors for a planned pool of 50, from which the panel will be selected. <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> can also be hot tempered as he was when he threatened an <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> reporter with a contempt-of-court citation for airing an account of jury selection that he said `` appears to be a deliberate effort'' to disrupt the process. The judge's storm of vituperation quickly passed and there has been no further mention of contempt proceedings against the television reporter, <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Brien </PERSON>. <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON>'s experience with big cases and troubling issues throughout his 20-year career on the bench no doubt figured in the decision by <PERSON> Aubrey </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, the chief judge of <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> here, to assign the Iran-Contra cases to him. Throughout the pre-trial maneuverings several judges expressed the view that if any jurist could bring the difficult case to trial it would be <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON>. `` He is just very much in control,'' said <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Jeffress </PERSON>, a criminal defense lawyer who clerked for <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> in the early 1970s. `` I would certainly say he has a dominating personality. He is and remains in control of what goes on in his court.'' <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> has had his share of other famous cases, notably the Watergate plumbers case in 1974, which involved the conspiracy to break into the office of a <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> psychiatrist to get the patient records of <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ellsberg </PERSON>, who leaked the Pentagon Papers to <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> refused in 1971 to enjoin <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> from publishing its version of the secret <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> study of the Vietnam War. He was the only federal judge who refused to grant the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s requests for injunctions to delay newpaper publication of the Pentagon Papers _ a position vindicated by a unanimous <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> decision in the case. A year earlier, <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> had enjoined the Government Printing Office from publishing a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> report listing 65 `` radical revolutionary'' campus speakers. The judge found it had served no `` legislative purpose and was issued solely for exposure for intimidation.'' After attending <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION> as an undergraduate and law student, <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> came to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> during the New Deal and went to work at the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> for <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> O. </PERSON> <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON>, who later became a <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> justice. At the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> successfully investigated a major Wall Street investment scandal _ an episode <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> cites in his memoirs. Later, <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> became a partner for the celebrated <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> law firm of <PERSON> Covington </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Burling </ORGANIZATION>, making his mark as an anti-trust lawyer. With his rosy cheeks, the white-haired jurist was once aptly described by <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> as resembling a clean-shaven <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Claus </LOCATION>. Known among friends as a jovial raconteur, <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> usually spends the month of August at his summer home on an island off the cost of <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>. On most weekends, he and his wife, <PERSON> Peggy </PERSON>, go to their dairy farm near <LOCATION> Leesburg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, where he produces his own brand of honey that is sold in local stores and vegetable stands. <PERSON> Jeffress </PERSON> said <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> is not just a `` gentleman farmer who goes out and gets waited on, but a farmer who gets his feet dirty.''

<HEAD>`Pollster' Wright Gets More Feedback Than He Bargained For</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 When House Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> sent out a questionnaire on the pay raise issue to his colleagues last week, one came back with a cryptic note: `` <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Rayburn </PERSON> would not have sent out a survey like this.'' The reference to fellow <PERSON> Texan </PERSON> <PERSON> Rayburn </PERSON>, considered among the strongest <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> speakers in the century, was a pointed jab at <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> for failing to take command on the controversial issue and instead attempting to spread the blame by seeking the opinions of his colleagues. `` There were four who wrote on the survey something to the effect that ` This is a bum idea,''' <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> conceded to reporters as he handed out the results of his poll last week. But he contended many more members were glad to be consulted on how to handle the recommended 51 percent pay hike. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s venture into the polling business, an apparent attempt to demonstrate that he was acting on behalf of a majority of <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> members to engineer a salary increase, appeared to have backfired in several ways. For one, the speaker failed to consult even his top leadership team before sending out the 12-question survey form. The leaders, in turn, were left scrambling to distance themselves from what they clearly considered a dubious idea. Some senior Democrats were bitter about the move. `` This has permanently hurt <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>,'' said one, speaking only on condition of anonymity. In addition, the confidential survey was sharply at odds with the outcomes of several public surveys conducted by the news media and interest groups. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said of 326 House members responding privately to his survey, 57 percent did not want to vote on the pay raise before it goes into effect at midnight Tuesday. But when The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> queried 105 lawmakers, 88 percent said they did want to vote before the deadline. In an informal poll of 278 members by the self-described consumer group <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Citizen </ORGANIZATION>, 265 _ 61 percent of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> _ said on the record that they wanted a vote. `` Somebody's not telling the truth,'' said Public Citizen's <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Nader </PERSON>, an outspoken pay raise critic. `` For the speaker to expose members to a charge of lying is a very serious case of leadership run amok.'' <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> intended the survey to bolster his strategy of letting the raise go into effect, then holding a vote to roll it back to 30 percent. But it instead showed the speaker could fall short of the two-thirds majority needed for a rollback under the expedited process he chose for bringing the issue to the floor. What the results did show was deep division among <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> members over the entire issue of congressional pay and how it is set, and inconsistency between the answers to some questions. For example: _ Fifty-six percent favored and 44 percent opposed the process under which pay levels for lawmakers and top officials are recommended by an independent commission, proposed by the president and put in effect automatically unless both houses vote to cancel them. _ On the question of whether they would vote against any effort to rescind the raise entirely, 49 percent said yes and 46 percent said no. _ Asked if the 50 percent raise for <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and similar increases for other top government jobs were `` fair and proper,'' 54 percent said yes. But asked more specifically about the amount of the increases, 56 percent said they were too high. _ A majority, 54 percent, opposed a vote before Wednesday on banning honoraria, such as fees for speaking before lobbying groups, and limiting the raise to 30 percent. But after Wednesday, and following an honoraria ban, 61 percent favored rolling back the pay raise to 30 percent. Only on one question were sentiments near unanimous: 98 percent said they would vote to ban honoraria if the pay raise goes into effect. The survey `` has put the heat on everybody, and it is n't going to go away,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> Penny </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>, one of the few Democrats willing to criticize the speaker publicly. `` This issue is going to leave a bad taste in the mouths of a lot of members, and eventually that's got to add up. Sooner or later, the good will is going to be gone.'' Some lawmakers observed that <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> came into the fray over pay carrying heavy political baggage from two continuing <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Ethics <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> investigations into his conduct. One case, involving allegations the speaker abused his office while majority leader for financial gain, is expected to be resolved late this month. Whatever the outcome of that inquiry, <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> will likely face another public pummeling led by his chief accuser, Rep. <PERSON> Newt </PERSON> <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON>, R-Ga., and the fallout from the survey could hurt, said one prominent House Democrat `` In a matter of weeks, he'll be asking these same people to stand up for him against <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON>,'' said the lawmaker.

 <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> does n't get hate mail from constituents or pressure from lobbying groups. But like congressmen, federal judges and President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s Cabinet officers, he's up for a sizable pay raise. <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON>, research director at an <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> laboratory in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, is one of 7,100 members of the senior executive service _ managers of federal programs ranging from space missions to tax collection _ whose pay is tied to presidential recommendations. Spokesman <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Lafferty </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Personnel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> calls the senior executives `` the top part of the federal government's middle management.'' To <PERSON> Carol </PERSON> <PERSON> Bonosaro </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Senior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Executive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, a group formed by the senior managers, they are `` the glue of the government. Without them it could n't run.'' Annual salaries for senior managers now range from $ 68,700 to $ 80,700; they would be $ 80,000 to $ 120,000 if the raise takes effect on Wednesday, with the average being $ 98,000. While <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the judges would get a 51 percent raise, members of the senior executive service would get raises ranging from 16 percent to 49 percent. Another 700 federal employees known as `` super graders'' who have management responsibilities would get similar pay hikes. The exact size of the pay increases is in flux, as congressional leaders deal with mounting pressure to scale back the raise. A dozen senior executives interviewed in recent weeks said, not surprisingly, that they supported the raise. Most said their support stemmed not solely from personal financial interest but also from a hope that higher pay will help the government attract top talent. <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> has been a federal employee for 28 years, rising through the ranks to a position in which he now is directly responsible for 200 people, five of whom are at top civil service levels and paid more than he is. Still, in <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON>'s words, `` It's always my hide if there's a screw up.'' <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> is paid $ 71,900 a year and said his salary would rise to $ 90,000 if <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> allows the pay package to take effect on Wednesday. He says he could make double that in the private sector, but wo n't quit despite having two sons in college and a third in high school. `` I've built a life and career in government and I intend to stay even after I reach retirement eligibility in two years,'' <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> said in a telephone interview. <PERSON> Marylouise </PERSON> <PERSON> Uhlig </PERSON> predicts `` a major crisis in government'' if <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> kills the pay raises, something she said would prompt a `` major exodus'' of managers. `` I really do think that you get the kind of government that you pay for,'' said <PERSON> Uhlig </PERSON>, director of program management at the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>'s pesticide and toxic substances division. `` In order to keep good people you have to pay them.'' <PERSON> Uhlig </PERSON>'s duties as director of the agency's Office of Pesticides and Toxic Substances range from hiring and budgeting to acting as a liaison with regional <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> offices. `` I'm paying for this raise too,'' is her answer to criticism the raises will bloat the federal budget. `` My entire salary is taxed.'' If you want to know how much grain is grown in <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION> or the top crop in <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> you might try <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Vogel </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s state statistical division. `` You look at some of the salaries on the outside and you wonder why you hang around and listen to all of the government bashing,'' said <PERSON> Vogel </PERSON>, who supervises 675 employees in 45 states and a $ 40 million budget. So why does he? `` You get committed to your job and your employees and you feel that what you're doing helps,'' said <PERSON> Vogel </PERSON>, who now makes $ 76,400 a year and would see his pay to jump to $ 98,000. <PERSON> Bonosaro </PERSON> said an informal survey by the Senior Executives Association supported <PERSON> Uhlig </PERSON>'s talk of a mass exodus in the management posts. `` They have no real reason to stay and wait another four years,'' she said. The commission that suggested the raises meets every four years. The commission said the cost of paying the executives' raises would be $ 41 million in the current fiscal year and $ 71 million next year. `` Less than a third of the cost of a B-1 bomber,'' is the comparison made by <PERSON> Bonosaro </PERSON>.

<TEXT>
 As a candidate, <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> promised a `` kinder, gentler nation'' without saying how he'd pay for it. Now, with the day of reckoning near, President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s efforts to finance his campaign promises are meeting unexpected complications. The difficulty of crafting a rescue plan for the troubled savings-and-loan industry and disagreement over defense spending levels are making it harder for budget officials to finish rewriting former President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s $ 1.15 trillion fiscal 1990 budget, according to administration and congressional sources. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> goes before a joint session of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and a nationwide televison audience Thursday to hang a pricetag on his campaign vows and to show how he'll meet Gramm-Rudman defict targets while adhering to his `` read my lips, no new taxes'' slogan. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s budget, according to sources, probably wo n't look as good on paper as did <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s, which proclaimed a deficit reduction in the upcoming fiscal year to $ 92.8 billion _ down from the estimated $ 161.5 billion in the current year. The new budget will project a deficit barely under the $ 100 billion ceiling called for in the Gramm-Rudman law, which aims for a balanced budget by 1993 through declining annual steps, the sources said. The president's campaign proposals for new spending on education, child care, the homeless and environmental cleanup add up to well over $ 5 billion _ money that his administration is finding all but impossible to squeeze from already tight federal ledgers. With just a few days to go, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> aides said, many pivotal decisions have yet to be made by the president, including whether to go along with his predecessor's proposed $ 4 billion increase in defense spending, or to freeze it at the rate of inflation _ which would free up about $ 2 billion for other programs. Although <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has generally proposed a `` flexible freeze'' that would hold overall spending at the rate of inflation, some key aides, including Chief of Staff <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON>, have reportedly been pressing for higher levels of defense spending. Administration officials, who insisted upon anonymity, have said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s budget will call for lower defense spending than proposed by <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, but how much lower had not yet been determined. Congressional sources, who requested anonymity, said the administration is looking into the option of no growth except for inflation, possibly over a three-year period. The administration officials also said that some of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s campaign promises will surface in scaled-back form in the budget, or not be financed at all Still, a senior official said that the major ones would at least be noted, if not fully paid for. Among <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s more ambitious campaign promises: a $ 1,000 child-care tax credit for low-income families; a $ 500 million <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Merit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> program to aid the country's best schools; a multiyear $ 5 billion program to attack acid rain; expansion of Medicaid, housing vouchers for the poor and a new tax-free individual savings plan. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will also have to find money in his budget to pay for cleaning up deteriorating nuclear plants. Given his no-tax pledge and the tightness of available funds, it seems unlikely that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> can afford to retreat from <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s proposal to ax more than five-dozen programs; or to restore much of the $ 5.5 billion cuts in <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> proposed by the former president Coming up with a budget plan in time for Thursday's address to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has been complicated by the savings-and-loan crisis. Federal regulators say that from $ 85 billion to $ 100 billion will be needed to shore up the industry. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and his top financial advisers were huddled Saturday at the presidential retreat at Camp David, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, trying to work out a solution. An original trial balloon by the administration to charge depositors a fee of 25 cents for each $ 100 on deposit was quickly deflated on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>. Still, White House aides were reluctant to rule it out entirely, claiming the means for raising the rescue funds had dwindled to a precious few. Congressional speculation as of Saturday was that the administration would propose raising the money through the sale of special 30-year <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bonds, with an increase in insurance fees paid by financial institutions to cover the $ 6 billion to $ 7 billion cost of servicing, or paying interest on, the bonds. The president also must make room in his budget for his proposal to reduce the tax on capital gains to a maximum of 15 percent _ and then to use what he claims will be increased revenues from that move to pay for other tax breaks. Those include restoring tax benefits for the oil and gas industry and establishing tax-free `` enterprise zones'' in inner cities. In all, it's a big order for a new president who conceded even in his inaugural address that there was `` more will than wallet.'' In a speech Friday to a group of business leaders, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` next week, we're going to have to come forward with some tough decisions.'' And, he added, `` I've heard from a lot of you here the importance of having what we send up there credible, so that world markets will understand that this is for real.''

<HEAD>Reports: Hostages To Be Freed Soon</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Five Lebanese publications predicted Saturday that some foreign hostages held in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> will be freed soon. One magazine said two of the nine missing Americans will be released. Also Saturday, Irish Ambassador <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> McCabe </PERSON>, who spent one week in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> trying to verify reports hostage <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Keenan </PERSON> might be released, said there was `` a distinct possibility'' <PERSON> Keenan </PERSON> would be freed. The reports marked the first time several Lebanese publications have simultaneously carried nearly identical articles about the possible release of foreign captives. The reports came shortly after a top Iranian official and a Shiite Moslem leader predicted a breakthrough in the hostage problem. The An-Nahar Arab and International weekly said the Iranian-backed <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> has `` decided to release two American captives as a goodwill gesture.'' It gave no names. The magazine, based in Christian east <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, quoted an unidentified <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> official as saying: `` The scenario is being set for the release.'' The brief report did not elaborate. <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>, made up of Shiite Moslem zealots, is believed to be the umbrella organization for several groups holding hostages. There are 15 foreigners missing in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. In addition to the nine Americans and <PERSON> Keenan </PERSON>, who holds both <LOCATION> Irish </LOCATION> and British citizenship, there are three Britons, an Italian and a Belgian. The longest held is <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, chief <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> correspondent for <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, who was kidnapped March 16, 1985. The leftist daily As-Safir, which has close ties with the Syrian army command in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, said: `` Diplomatic information speaks of the possible release of some -LRB- foreign -RRB- hostages in the next two weeks.'' The weekly <PERSON> Ash-Shiraa </PERSON> said the hostage issue `` has been put on a hot burner.'' Its brief report said without elaborating: `` This could result in releasing them ... in the light of a decision to this effect adopted by regional powers interested in this case.'' The independent An-Nahar and conservative Ad-Diyar dailies both said a peace pact reached Monday in <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION> between <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Amal </ORGANIZATION>, the rival pro-Syrian <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> militia, also aims at securing the release of foreign captives. The pact, sponsored by <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, halted a nine-month war between the rival militias. `` Informed sources believe that the basic aim of the <ORGANIZATION> Amal-Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> accord is to work on the release of foreign captives held in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>,'' said An-Nahar, <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s most prestigious newspaper. The report did not elaborate. Ad-Diyar quoted an unidentified official as saying the <ORGANIZATION> Amal-Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> accord `` could result in the handing over of some foreign hostages to the Syrians.'' <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> is the main power broker in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> with 40,000 troops deployed in predominantly Moslem areas. In the past, some foreign captives were set free in Syrian-controlled sectors of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, and the <ORGANIZATION> Syrians </ORGANIZATION> took credit for their release. The Irish ambassador, who spent one week in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> trying to verify reports about <PERSON> Keenan </PERSON>'s possible release, returned to <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> on Saturday. Before departing he told reporters: `` I leave with the impression that the release of <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Keenan </PERSON> before long remains a distinct possibility.'' <PERSON> Keenan </PERSON>, a teacher from <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION>, was kidnapped April 11, 1986 in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>'s Moslem sector. No group has claimed his abduction. <PERSON> McCabe </PERSON> said he would return to <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> `` in coming weeks or sooner'' if necessary.

<TEXT>
 Soviet Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> ended a three-day visit to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> on Saturday by announcing the nations will hold their first summit in 30 years in mid-May. <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> said Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> will travel to <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> at the invitation of the Chinese for a meeting with senior leader <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaoping </PERSON>. Soviet sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the summit was tentatively scheduled for May 15. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s Deputy Foreign Minister <PERSON> Tian </PERSON> <PERSON> Zengpei </PERSON>, however, said no date had been set and that the Chinese were `` studying the proposal'' for the May meeting. <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> later flew to <LOCATION> Islamabad </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, for meetings with Pakistani leaders about the Soviet troop withdrawal from neighboring <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. At a news conference before his departure, <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> said <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> told him the summit would `` close the page on the past and open up a chapter on the future.'' In a move toward `` complete normalization'' of relations, diplomats and other officials are to discuss reducing military tensions along the 5,000-mile Soviet-Chinese border, he said. Western diplomats said the issue first came up when Chinese Foreign Minister <PERSON> Qian </PERSON> <PERSON> Qichen </PERSON> visited <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> in December. `` We hope at the summit we will be able to make progress in that important direction,'' <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> said. He said the first step might be an agreement on advance notice of troop movements and military exercises, and then negotiations for disbanding offensive forces. In the 1950s, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> depended on Soviet technical and military aid and followed the Soviet lead in diplomatic policy. Relations between the countries soured in 1960 over ideological and strategic disputes, and they fought a brief border war in 1969. The Chinese agreed to discuss a summit last year after progress was made on what they call the `` three obstacles'' _ border tensions, Soviet aid for <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s invasion of <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> intervention in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. The last Soviet troops are supposed to be out of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> by Feb. 15. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> has pledged to remove from <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> 200,000 Soviet troops, many now stationed along the Chinese border, and has said that most of <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s 50,000 troops in <LOCATION> Mongolia </LOCATION> will be withdrawn. <PERSON> Qian </PERSON> was the first <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> foreign minister to visit <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> in 32 years. <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>'s visit was the first by a Soviet foreign minister in 30 years and was designed to lay the groundwork for the summit. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> formally issued its invitation to <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> on Friday. `` Substantive progress has been made'' on obstacles that have stood in the way of a summit, Deputy Foreign Minister <PERSON> Tian </PERSON> told reporters following <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>'s departure. `` This visit produced results.'' He said the two sides now agree that <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> should end its 10-year occupation of <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> by September as promised and that there should be international supervision of the troop withdrawal. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> backs the anti-Vietnamese resistance in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> and has demanded <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> pressure its ally, <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, to pull out. <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> said better Sino-Soviet relations are the result of the countries' economic reforms and he envisioned increased trading between the nations. The countries are believed to want to ease tensions so they can concentrate less on military matters and more on rejuvenating their economies. <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> flew to <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION>, about 870 miles south of <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, for the 90-minute meeting with <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> on Saturday morning. He said <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s top leader was `` a very wise man who has a lot of rich experience.'' There have been rumors that the 84-year-old <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> is in failing health but <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> said he appeared quite fit.

<HEAD>Antarctic Oil Spill May Threaten Wildlife Research, Scientists Fear</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MALCOLM RITTER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Oil from a sunken ship off <LOCATION> Antarctica </LOCATION> threatens not only the environment in a pristine bay, but also wildlife research in a biologically rich area prized until now for its unspoiled state, scientists say. `` The paths of research that have been followed down there have been forever changed,'' said <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Talmadge </PERSON>. `` I think if you're a scientist in the year 2035, you've got to remember there was an oil spill.'' <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> DeLaca </PERSON>, chief scientist of the foundation's polar programs, said the highly sensitive environment `` has been compromised in a way that we ca n't even evaluate right now.'' While the spill's effect on future research can not yet be determined, `` it's something I find personally disturbing,'' he said by telephone Friday from <LOCATION> Palmer </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Station </LOCATION>, a research outpost near the spill. The oil is leaking from an Argentine research and supply ship that ran aground Jan. 25. The ship is nearly submerged on shoals in the <LOCATION> Bismarck </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strait </LOCATION> just off the <LOCATION> Antarctic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> peninsula </LOCATION>, 600 miles from the tip of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. Authorities said the ship carried at least 200,000 gallons of fuel oil in its tanks and more in drums lashed to the deck. American cleanup crews are expected to reach the site sometime this week. Some scientists said the effects of the spill may be magnified because it involved fuel oil, more dangerous to wildlife than crude oil, and because <LOCATION> Antarctic </LOCATION> conditions could slow the oil's decomposition The spill struck an area that has `` the largest and most diverse plant and animal populations of the continent,'' said <PERSON> Polly </PERSON> <PERSON> Penhale </PERSON>, manager of the science foundation's polar biology and medicine program. Apart from a large seal population, some 30,000 sea birds live in the area affected by the spill, including <ORGANIZATION> Adele </ORGANIZATION> and chinstrap penguins, cormorants, kelp gulls and giant petrels, <PERSON> Penhale </PERSON> said. `` It is one of the most spectacularly beautiful areas in the whole <LOCATION> Antarctica </LOCATION>,'' said Sayed Z. <PERSON> El-Sayed </PERSON>, an oceanography professor at <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> A </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> M </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> who has studied it for 25 years. Most plants and animals live on islands off the mainland, where the science foundation operates <ORGANIZATION> Palmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Station </ORGANIZATION> on a spit of rock. Scientists have already seen oil-covered and apparently lethargic seals, three dead penguins and disappearances of young nesting birds, <PERSON> DeLaca </PERSON> said. Thirty-eight of 40 penguins checked Friday bore traces of oil. Thousands of dead and dying krill, shrimplike crustaceans that are a key food for bigger animals, have shown up on beaches, he said. `` All the principal -LRB- penguin -RRB- rookeries here are now surrounded by fuel oil,'' he said. `` What its effect could be on the birds is anybody's guess.'' Birds can freeze to death if the oil disrupts their natural insulation, or be poisoned if they swallow oil while preening themselves or eating contaminated prey. Scientists have studied wildlife in the area for more than 20 years, focusing on birds and seals and also on such organisms as fish, kelp, krill and shelled animals called limpets. `` One of the main concerns of the scientists ... is that that area stay pristine, because we have a lot of environmental research that's going on,'' said <PERSON> Langdon </PERSON> <PERSON> Quetin </PERSON>, research biologist at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Barbara </LOCATION>. `` It is one of the few areas in the <LOCATION> Antarctic </LOCATION> we have good logistics to,'' he said. The spill `` will be the ruination of a good laboratory, at least in the near future, at least as a natural uncontaminated study area.'' Some scientists are particularly concerned about fish and other organisms kept in tanks at <LOCATION> Palmer </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Station </LOCATION>, which marine botanist <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Neushul </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Barbara </LOCATION> calls `` probably the best marine biology laboratory in the Antarctic.'' The tanks draw seawater from the nearby harbor, and if oil contaminates that supply, the experiments might have to be stopped. Nobody knows yet whether that will be a problem, <PERSON> Penhale </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Neushul </PERSON> said one factor boding poorly for the area's wildlife is that the spill involved fuel oil, which is much more toxic than crude oil because it can damage biological tissue. <PERSON> Neushul </PERSON>, who investigated a spill of partially refined oil off <LOCATION> Baja </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> 30 years ago, said that spill caused mass deaths of fish, starfish, sea urchins and other animals. The same may happen to similar animals in the <LOCATION> Antarctic </LOCATION>, he said. In the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> spill, the environment took 17 years to recover, he said. Recovery in <LOCATION> Antarctica </LOCATION> may take even longer because bacteria there will need a long time to break the oil down, said <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Dayton </PERSON>, professor of marine ecology at the <ORGANIZATION> Scripps </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oceanography </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jolla </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>. After years of studying wildlife in a pristine environment, researchers are now turning to monitor how the wildlife responds to the oil spill, <PERSON> Talmadge </PERSON> said `` This disaster is the experiment nobody wanted,'' he said.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> says 7,000 new AIDS cases were reported last month, raising the worldwide total to nearly 140,000. Most of the increase was due to updated reports on acquired immune deficiency syndrome from the <LOCATION> Americas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> WHO </ORGANIZATION> said Friday in its monthly update on the spread of the deadly disease. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> reported more than half of the new cases, nearly 4,000. WHO estimated the real number of adult cases was between 350,000 and 400,000 by the end of last year, with sub-Saharan <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> thought to account for more than half the victims The <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> agency noted that the accuracy of reports on AIDS patients varies widely between countries and continents. WHO said 139,886 cases were reported from 144 countries by Jan. 31, a rise of 6,910 over a month earlier. Thirty-three countries said they had no cases. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Caledonia </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> territory, reported its first victims: two as of Aug. 1. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, which has recorded 60 percent of all AIDS cases, reported 3,965 new cases last month. <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, with the highest total and case rate in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, reported an increase of 781 to 5,655 cases. <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> reported 452 new victims, bringing its total to 3,008. <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>'s figure rose to 2,165 with the report of 315 new cases. AIDS is caused by a virus that damages the body's immune system, leaving victims susceptible to infections and cancer. It is spread most often through sexual contact, needles or syringes shared by drug abusers, infected blood or blood products, and from pregnant women to their offspring.

 <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> left the White House two weeks ago to retire as elder statesman in his beloved <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, but instead of lounging around the pool he's been busy lining up work and visiting old haunts. The ex-president has signed a book deal worth up to $ 7 million, lined up a $ 50,000-per-speech lecture contract and opened his <LOCATION> Century </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> offices, where a variety of offers are pouring in. There are also social demands: His 78th birthday party Monday night at the ritzy <LOCATION> Bistro </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gardens </LOCATION>, a Feb. 23 <LOCATION> Palm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION> gala honoring <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> and a private welcome-home dinner Feb. 25. `` The change of address has n't caused any slowing down of their schedule,'' said <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Weinberg </PERSON>. `` They are very active and on the go.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and wife <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> have n't even taken time yet to visit their <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Barbara </LOCATION> mountaintop Rancho del Cielo. Rumors they might sell the ranch have repeatedly been denied by the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> staff. Shunning the reclusive lifestyle of many celebrities, the couple often venture from their <LOCATION> Bel-Air </LOCATION> home to dine at <LOCATION> Chasens </LOCATION>, attend Sunday church services or visit friends. <ORGANIZATION> Secret </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> agents drive <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> from his $ 2.5 million hillside home to <ORGANIZATION> Century </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION>, a distance of five miles, where he takes a private elevator to his 34th-floor office suite at <ORGANIZATION> Fox </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Plaza </ORGANIZATION> and spends about six hours daily at his desk. Foreign dignitaries dropping in on <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> have included Ugandan President H.E. <PERSON> Yoweri </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Museveni </PERSON> and Japanese Prime Minister <PERSON> Noboru </PERSON> <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>. He has received a telephone call from <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Kissinger </PERSON>, a telegram from <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s Prince <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> and flowers from neighbors. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> invited news photographers to his office last week to take pictures of him at his desk before a private office lunch with his former agent, <ORGANIZATION> MCA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. Chairman <PERSON> Lew </PERSON> <PERSON> Wasserman </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> is apparently fielding corporate board membership offers, with <ORGANIZATION> MCA </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dodgers </ORGANIZATION> baseball franchise seen as sure bets. He also is being sought for radio, television and motion pictures. Hours after relinquishing the presidency to <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on Jan. 20, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> told cheering supporters at a <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> rally that he had been asked to star in a sequel to `` Bedtime for <PERSON> Bonzo </PERSON>,'' the 1951 comedy he shared with a chimpanzee. `` Only this time they wanted me to play <PERSON> Bonzo </PERSON>,'' he joked. However, longtime friend <PERSON> Irving </PERSON> `` Swifty'' <PERSON> Lazar </PERSON>, who said he was working on an unspecified project for the ex-president, dismissed as `` ridiculous'' the possibility of a Reagan cinematic comeback. `` There are many invitations for a variety of opportunities, but President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has no current plans to appear in any movies,'' <PERSON> Weinberg </PERSON> said. However, the nation may hear <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> on Saturday morning radio again, expressing his thoughts and opinions, <PERSON> Lazar </PERSON> said. For now, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s top priority is his memoirs, a book for <ORGANIZATION> Simon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Schuster </PERSON> that the former president promised would be `` an honest and straightforward look at where we have been, with some thoughts on where we're going.'' `` He is working on the book every day, going through files and handwriting his thoughts on a legal pad,'' <PERSON> Weinberg </PERSON> said. On Monday, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> details his plans during a 20-minute no-fee speech at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION>, his first public appearance since the Jan. 20 homecoming rally. `` He's spending the weekend working on it,'' <PERSON> Weinberg </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> also is expected to produce messages condemning abortion and to campaign for a change in the 22nd Amendment, which limits presidents to two terms. `` It's an infringement on your democratic rights,'' private citizen <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said after <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s inaugural. <PERSON> Mouaffak </PERSON> <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Midani </PERSON>, who has a <LOCATION> Beverly </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION> estate and reportedly owns utilities in <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>, has expressed interest in Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s anti-drug crusade, <PERSON> Weinberg </PERSON> said. Money is still needed for the <ORGANIZATION> Nancy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reagan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> for drug rehabilitation proposed for a site in the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fernando </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>. Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s calendar includes a meeting this month with <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> Police Chief <PERSON> Daryl </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gates </PERSON> and an anti-drug video sponsored by <ORGANIZATION> Kiwanis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>.

 Amber, <PERSON> Michaela </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ilene </PERSON>: young girls living anonymous lives in quiet, middle-class suburbs of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> until one by one they disappeared without a trace. It is n't as if a child has never vanished, been kidnapped or run away from any of the commuter towns near the bay. But some see unsettling similarities in these three cases, although they remain unexplained and unsolved. Seven-year-old Amber Schwart-Garcia vanished June 3 after she went to play in the front yard of her <LOCATION> Pinole </LOCATION> home. Five months later, on Nov. 19, Amber's case drew new attention. That was the day 9-year-old <PERSON> Michaela </PERSON> <PERSON> Joy </PERSON> <PERSON> Garecht </PERSON> was snatched by a stringy-haired stranger in a dingy car outside a market in <LOCATION> Hayward </LOCATION>, about 30 miles south of <LOCATION> Pinole </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Michaela </PERSON> and a friend had ridden their scooters a short distance from home to get some candy and pop. The friend said she watched in horror as the man grabbed <PERSON> Michaela </PERSON> and roared off. <PERSON> Hayward </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Pinole </LOCATION> are situated just off busy freeways that serve communities along <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>. Near <PERSON> Hayward </PERSON>, Interstate 580 shoots off to the east, heading to other communities that share the two towns' rambling housing tracts, kids on skateboards, fast-food restaurants and shopping malls. Communities like <LOCATION> Dublin </LOCATION>, where 13-year-old <PERSON> Ilene </PERSON> <PERSON> Misheloff </PERSON> disappeared Monday. She was last seen about 3 p.m., walking along a major thoroughfare on her way to a skating rink. Her family describes her as a good student, a girl who never varied from her routine without letting her parents know. At first reluctant to categorize her disappearance as a kidnapping, investigators said Friday that she may indeed have been kidnapped. Evidence of community concern is everywhere. Yellow ribbons dot virtually every major <LOCATION> Dublin </LOCATION> street. People can be seen posting pictures of <PERSON> Ilene </PERSON> on utility poles in the rain. <PERSON> Ilene </PERSON>'s synagogue held a prayer service for her Thursday night and local churches plan to do the same in coming days. `` All the parents I know have sat their children down and talked to them,'' said <PERSON> Connie </PERSON> <PERSON> Spence </PERSON>, one of the volunteers who worked feverishly Friday answering phones, passing out fliers and accepting donations. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>, a resident of <LOCATION> Benicia </LOCATION> about 35 miles north of <LOCATION> Dublin </LOCATION>, dropped by the volunteers' headquarters with enough paper to make 45,000 fliers with <PERSON> Ilene </PERSON>'s picture. `` I've got 10 grandchildren,'' he said, `` so I feel for what's happened. People traveling to <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Tahoe </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> have picked up fliers, as did an airline pilot flying East. The <ORGANIZATION> Postal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> is passing out fliers in <LOCATION> Dublin </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pleasanton </LOCATION> along with the mail. `` We ca n't even begin to understand the feelings of the parents,'' said <LOCATION> Pleasanton </LOCATION> Postmaster <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Cantu </PERSON>. `` But we know that if it were our kids, we'd want help, too.'' At <PERSON> Ilene </PERSON>'s school, <ORGANIZATION> Wells </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intermediate </ORGANIZATION>, few children walk to school alone these days. `` We all are being more careful,'' said <PERSON> Toni </PERSON> <PERSON> Dona </PERSON>, whose daughter is a classmate of <PERSON> Ilene </PERSON>'s. `` The kids are grouping together and the parents are car-pooling.'' `` It's constantly on their minds, when they see that empty chair next to them. It's hard not to think about it,'' <PERSON> Dona </PERSON> said. `` Especially when you turn on the news every morning and hear about it. And now we're not hearing anything _ which is even worse.'' Police say they've received about 200 calls a day, not counting those coming in on the toll-free hotline. The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> has joined the investigation, but spokesman <PERSON> Chuck </PERSON> <PERSON> Latting </PERSON> said the agency has nothing more to report than police. There's no proof <PERSON> Ilene </PERSON>'s disappearance is related to the others, but no evidence to rule out the possibility either, he said. <PERSON> Ilene </PERSON>'s parents, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> and <PERSON> Madelyne </PERSON> <PERSON> Misheloff </PERSON>, said they spoke with their children after <PERSON> Michaela </PERSON>'s disappearance, just as they had warned them before about being careful around strangers. Before his daughter's disappearance, <PERSON> Misheloff </PERSON> familiarized himself with a sketch of the suspect in the Garecht case. But he said he had not been unduly alarmed that the same thing could happen to his children. `` This is a very quiet community, low-crime area, where if there is a crime, you notice it ... not like in one of the large cities where there seems to be a serious crime just about every day,'' he said. <PERSON> Ilene </PERSON>'s parents said they have no gut feeling about whether her disappearance is linked to the others. `` Unfortunately for all of us, three children are gone ... and one of them is our daughter,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Misheloff </PERSON>, choking back tears. `` She's not home, and it's cold and it's raining.''

 <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tower </PERSON>'s reputation and the intent of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> to conduct a thorough investigation collided head-on this week as the expected confirmation of the defense secretary-designate hit a snag. New allegations surfaced Thursday of a drinking problem and womanizing, prompting the committee to postpone a planned vote on Tower's nomination until the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> could complete a new inquiry. Despite the new twist to the well-circulated but unsubstantiated rumors, senators said they expect the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> panel to approve the Tower nomination and forward their recommendation to the full <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Warner </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, ranking Republican on the panel, said he expected the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> report to reach the panel on Monday, `` and ... we can proceed to vote Tuesday or Wednesday.'' Tower was dogged by allegations of drinking and womanizing before his nomination. In divorce papers filed two years ago by his second wife, <PERSON> Lilla </PERSON> <PERSON> Burt </PERSON> <PERSON> Cummings </PERSON>, Tower was accused of `` marital misconduct.'' When President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> announced Tower's appointment, he said an <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> background check found nothing that would prevent Tower from serving as defense secretary. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> dismissed `` a lot of rumors that proved to be groundless.'' The ranking members of the committee, Sen. <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON>, D-Ga., and <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION>, read the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> report, and any questions about Tower's personal life were reserved for executive sessions with committee But when conservative lobbyist <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Weyrich </PERSON> testified Tuesday at the committee's open hearing that `` on a number of occasions'' he had seen Tower inebriated and in the company of women other than his wife, the former senator's lifestyle was pushed to the forefront. One day later, according to congressional sources, the committee and the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> received new allegations regarding Tower, and the vote was postponed. Complicating matters is the committee's concerns about an appearance of conflict of interest. After his 24-year tenure in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, including a stint as chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, Tower worked as a defense consultant for such industry giants as <ORGANIZATION> Rockwell </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Martin-Marietta </ORGANIZATION>. In his testimony, <PERSON> Tower </PERSON> said he received more than $ 1 million in consulting fees over a 2 -LCB- - year period Although Tower said he had severed all ties with the companies, and promised to recuse himself from any decision on an <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> electronics system that he had lobbied for, members of the committee still voiced concern over conflict of interest. `` But what is the difference, in terms of the appearance, as to whether or not you lobbied <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> for a program or whether or not you advanced that program through other means?'' Sen. <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Levin </PERSON>, D-Mich., asked Tower on Wednesday `` Is n't the same connection to that program in existence?'' `` Senator, that's a judgment call on my part, and that's the only one in which I might have had some profile,'' Tower responded. `` I would emphasize I am not legally required to do this, but I have an abundance of caution, and that's a judgment call that I'm making myself.'' The committee also is conscious of its experience with <PERSON> Melvyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Paisley </PERSON>, a key figure in the Pentagon procurement investigation. <PERSON> Paisley </PERSON> was nominated in 1981 as assistant secretary of <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> and later confirmed. Tower, committee chairman at the time, said the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> refused the panel's request to see the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> report on <LOCATION> Paisley </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> said if they had known of the allegations against <PERSON> Paisley </PERSON> they would have withheld approval until the charges had been checked. The ranking members of the 1989 committee would like to avoid a similar incident. `` It's not over till it's over,'' <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> said Thursday. `` The investigation is not over until all serious allegations have been checked, and that's the process we always follow.''

 Hundreds of supporters of a Moslem party demonstrated Saturday near the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Embassy </LOCATION> to protest what they called the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>'s `` continued atrocities in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>.'' More than 500 members of the <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION> Moslem Movement participated in the protest. Witnesses said two truckloads of policemen followed the protestors as they marched toward the Soviet Embassy. The demonstrators were stopped a few hundred yards from the embassy, but a six-member delegation was allowed to enter the mission to submit a memorandum, according to the witnesses. Party chief <PERSON> Maulana </PERSON> <PERSON> Azizur </PERSON> <PERSON> Rahman </PERSON> said the Soviets were killing Afghan Moslems `` with a sense of vengeance.'' `` They have adopted a scorched-earth policy to kill Moslem brethren and destroy <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>,'' he told a meeting of the demonstrators. `` The peace-loving people of the world will not tolerate this.'' `` It is painful to believe that the Soviets continue their barbarism in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> even when they are withdrawing for the establishment of peace in the region,'' said <PERSON> Maulana </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamsur </PERSON> <PERSON> Rahman </PERSON>, another party leader. The Soviets have been accused of heavily bombing Afghan villages along the <LOCATION> Salang </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Highway </LOCATION>, the route taken by withdrawing <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> soldiers, to reduce attacks by Moslem guerrillas stationed nearby. Soviet troops moved into <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> in 1979 to support the Marxist government in a civil war against Moslem rebels.

<HEAD>Anecdotes Mark Japanese Prime Minister's Visit</HEAD>
<HEAD>By GENE KRAMER</HEAD>
<HEAD>Associated Press Writer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 It was inevitable that Japanese Prime Minister <PERSON> Noboru </PERSON> <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> would be asked during his get-acquainted call on the new <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration whether he addressed the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> president by his first name. Each new prime minister of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> generally visits <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> early in his term to demonstrate to the Japanese public that he will have good relations with his country's big trans-Pacific ally. <PERSON> Yasuhiro </PERSON> <PERSON> Nakasone </PERSON>, prime minister in 1982-87, set a new standard by proclaiming his vibrations with President <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> so positive that they called each other `` <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> and <PERSON> Yasu </PERSON>,'' American style. <PERSON> Nakasone </PERSON>'s successor, <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>, met that challenge a year ago when he was able to announce here that he had cultivated a `` Ron-Nobu'' first-name relationship with <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. And <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> happily told a Japanese embassy gathering here Thursday that he and `` George'' had decided to use first names. He added that he hopes they can have casual telephone exchanges and told reporters he was impressed by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s character and intelligence. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, addressing <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> at the White House Thursday, referred to the late Japanese emperor not as <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> but as Emperor <PERSON> Showa </PERSON>. The president was using the Japanese style of referring to a former emperor by the name of his era. The emperor, whose funeral <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> plans to attend Feb. 24 in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, died last month in the year <ORGANIZATION> Showa </ORGANIZATION> 63, which at the time was the Japanese calendar equivalent of 1989. The same year is now <ORGANIZATION> Heisei </ORGANIZATION> 1, using the name of the new era of Emperor <PERSON> Akihito </PERSON>. Showa means `` Enlightened Peace,'' <PERSON> Heisei </PERSON>, `` Peaceful Achievement.'' <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> told <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> the Japanese people were deeply moved by his decision to attend the state funeral. A former schoolteacher, <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> recalled at lunch in the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON> <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> <PERSON> Room </PERSON> that he was not very good at helping Japanese high school youngsters learn English, but he did teach them `` through <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON>'s writings, why <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> is so great and how Americans respect freedom, independence and diligence.'' `` The spirit of the American Revolution, as represented by <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON>, is alive and well,'' he added. Another <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> story was that he had stayed in <ORGANIZATION> Blair </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> presidential guest residence, 20 years ago as a 43-year-old aide to the late Prime Minister <PERSON> Eisaku </PERSON> <PERSON> Sato </PERSON> when <PERSON> Sato </PERSON> visited former President <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>. His boss suggested he should plan to stay in <ORGANIZATION> Blair </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> again on a future visit _ meaning he should aim at becoming prime minister. It came true. <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> and Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> reminisced about when they were their countries' respective finance ministers at the 1985 <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Plaza </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hotel </ORGANIZATION> meeting that grappled with currency exchange rates. <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> said currency rates `` should be decided by <PERSON> God </PERSON> and I agree with that,'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, then <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> secretary, recalled jokingly. One American dollar was then worth 245 Japanese yen but <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> and other finance ministers said it should be 215-220 yen, and `` two weeks later it became 215 yen,'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said. Today, one dollar is worth in the range of 130 yen. By coincidence finance ministers of the same seven `` G-7'' countries, accompanied by their staffs, met in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> during <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>'s latest visit. His last day here, he dropped in at their meeting for a brief round of handshakes with old acquaintances. From <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> started home via <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, where he plans to meet his friend `` Ron'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> Monday. A spokesman said it was in the tradition of Japanese etiquette that the prime minister should personally wish the retired president well and thank him for his leadership of the Western alliance. Asked why it was necessary for the prime minister to wait through the weekend for Monday, spokesman <PERSON> Koichi </PERSON> <PERSON> Haraguchi </PERSON> said <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s schedule was such that `` they can meet only on Feb 6.''

<HEAD>Plant-Closings Debate Still Raging as Law Takes Effect</HEAD>

 When <ORGANIZATION> Levi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Strauss </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> announced last week it would close a denim jacket plant in <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>, it gave 140 workers 90 days' paid notice. It was a better cushion than most workers have been getting when plants close down. <PERSON> Levi </PERSON> <PERSON> Strauss </PERSON> was following voluntary policies in place since 1984, guaranteeing workers advance notice of pending plant closings. Notice of plant closings and large-scale layoffs, however, is now the law. Plant closing legislation passed by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> last year took full effect Saturday, with business and labor still debating its impact and both sides predicting a flood of lawsuits. `` The companies are mystified at how complicated this law really is,'' said <PERSON> Renee </PERSON> <PERSON> Reymond </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturers </ORGANIZATION>. `` The labor attorneys certainly are poised and ready for business.'' Supporters say the law will not hurt business and gives workers a time to prepare for job loss. Federal figures show 64 percent of the nearly 2 million workers idled annually receive no notice. Opponents maintain the law represents a threat to industry. `` The threat is one of government fines, lawsuits, back pay and benefits expenses, loss of market image and costly training and adjustment problems,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Virginia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Employers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> declared recently. Then-President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> allowed the measure to become law in August without his signature, despite having earlier called it `` a ticking time bomb in the back seat of any medium-sized or larger company.'' Pressure from then presidential candidate <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was said to have influenced <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. On Capitol Hill, supporters of the concept still say it was long overdue. `` The ` chicken littles' have been proven wrong again,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, D-Mass. `` The sky did not fall. Enactment of this law was a triumph of reason over ideology and American workers will now receive the notice they deserve.'' Provisions of the law call for it to take effect Saturday, but some employers have started early on the theory that courts may eventually hold that shutdowns up to 60 days beforehand were covered. <ORGANIZATION> Lehigh </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Structural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Allentown </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, for example, announced Jan. 24 that its 184 employees would be laid off after current orders are filled. President <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Leslie </PERSON> <PERSON> Mullen </PERSON> said in a telephone interview last week that the company was observing the 60-day notice period. `` Nobody can seem to tell us what the law is, so we're being safe,'' <PERSON> Mullen </PERSON> said. A random survey of a dozen companies that have announced shutdowns or major layoffs in the past two months found that nearly all had given their workers at least 60 days' notice, most because of company policies in place before the law was passed. For example: _ <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> said last week it would close a pizza plant in <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> and a potato flake plant in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>, idling 334 workers who got 60 days' notice _ <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> T </ORGANIZATION> recently announced plans to close two facilities in the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, area, one with 500 workers, the other 130 Many are being offered jobs elesewhere in the company and <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> T </ORGANIZATION> has a policy of giving a minimum 90-day notice, spokesman <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Griffith </PERSON> said. _ <ORGANIZATION> Mack </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trucks </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> five weeks ago announced it was laying off 300 workers at its <LOCATION> Macungie </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, assembly plant, but since has said only about half that many would lose their jobs <PERSON> Mack </PERSON> spokeswoman <PERSON> Debbie </PERSON> <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON> said the union workers had been told of the initial layoff plans several months before the announcement. `` Our policy has been that we're not going to wait until February to be in compliance,'' she said. `` We decided to treat it as if it was in effect immediately.'' But about 130 workers at a microwave plant in <LOCATION> Sioux </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Falls </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.D. </LOCATION>, who lost their jobs Friday got only one week notice. The layoffs do not appear to be covered by the law _ even under the liberal interpretation of its effective date. The law requires advance notice of plant closings by employers with at least 100 full-time workers if the shutdown will cost 50 or more of those employees their jobs. In the case of layoffs, notices are required if the number of affected workers totals 33 percent of the company's employees or 500 _ whichever figure is lower. In <LOCATION> Sioux </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Falls </LOCATION>, Microwave Products of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> began the year with about 650 workers at its plant and in January laid off 155. That left the company with about 495 workers. By laying off 130 workers the company fell about 35 short of the 33 percent threshold. `` It was reviewed,'' company spokesman <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> said when asked about the plant closing law. He said the company's position was that the law did not carry weight until after Saturday and also noted that regardless of the effective date the layoffs did not meet the threshold.

 The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has paid late <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> dues of nearly $ 30 million, but it remains almost $ 500 million behind in payments to the regular <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> budget, officials said.

<TEXT>
 Quietly arranged payments to the mistress and two aides of a former mayor have sent City Hall into an uproar, with threats that the City Council may strip the mayor of some of his power. Mayor <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sarault </PERSON>, who is preparing to run for a second term in this old industrial city, says he was just cleaning up the `` tray of garbage'' left by his predecessor, <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kinch </PERSON>. Some <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> members, upset that they were n't consulted before the claims against the city were settled, want to end the mayor's power to settle claims unilaterally. `` From a business standpoint, it may have made sense to settle these,'' said Councilman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Q. </PERSON> <PERSON> Calista </PERSON>. `` But the fact remains, the public perception is one of rumors, innuendos, lack of confidence and mistrust.'' `` The council was never notified -LRB- of settlements -RRB- before, either. Why are we being held to a different standard?'' <PERSON> Sarault </PERSON> replied. `` We've been more open around here and I'm getting kicked in the teeth for it.'' `` Each of the problems I've been resolving, they're left over from the previous administration, which left me a tray of garbage that I have to clean up,'' said <PERSON> Sarault </PERSON>, who faces re-election in November. `` I literally did n't have a pen in my desk when I took over.'' The controversy in this city of 73,500 began last May, when the council discovered that <PERSON> Kinch </PERSON>, who declined to seek a fourth term in 1987, had awarded himself and eight aides a total of $ 128,000 in severance pay before leaving office. The situation attracted a wider audience in early January, after headlines about <PERSON> Sarault </PERSON>'s agreement to pay former City Clerk <PERSON> Penny </PERSON> <PERSON> Maynard </PERSON> $ 40,000 to settle a sex-discrimination complaint. She accused <PERSON> Kinch </PERSON> of firing her after their extramarital affair ended. `` That had all the makings of a class B movie,'' <PERSON> Sarault </PERSON> said. There was no comment from <PERSON> Kinch </PERSON>; he did not return a reporter's telephone calls <PERSON> Sarault </PERSON> and City Solicitor <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Joslyn </PERSON> said they settled the case because <PERSON> Maynard </PERSON> stood a good chance of winning a much larger judgment at trial. Council members complained they were never notified about the settlement, which was reached in October. Their complaints reached fever pitch when two other settlements were revealed _ one with <PERSON> Joslyn </PERSON> himself, whom <PERSON> Kinch </PERSON> fired from a city finance job because he leaked information to then-Councilman <PERSON> Sarault </PERSON>. `` If the newspaper reporters had n't walked in there, who knows if it ever would have come out?'' said Councilman <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Doyle </PERSON>, a <PERSON> Sarault </PERSON> opponent. Council President <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Houle </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> said mayors have never made a practice of disclosing settlements. `` I'm in my 20th year on the council,'' <PERSON> Houle </PERSON> said. `` In all those years, never once has any city solicitor ever reported to the council on any case nor has any council member ever questioned the city solicitor about any case.'' At a recent Council meeting, <PERSON> Sarault </PERSON> promised to keep the council better informed about settlements. A motion by one of his opponents to strip the mayor of his power to settle cases was deferred. Most of the council members said they were satisfied by the mayor's promises, but <PERSON> Doyle </PERSON> remained unconvinced. `` He's giving us a little pat and saying, ` OK, <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, we've forgotten you in the past but we'll come along and pick you up now,''' <PERSON> Doyle </PERSON> said. `` I think we'll have to wait and see.''

 A 30-year-old masterpiece of fraternity prankdom, the Smoot marks on <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bridge </ORGANIZATION>, will not pass into history after all, officials supervising the renovation of the bridge say. Back in October 1958, <ORGANIZATION> Lambda </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alpha </ORGANIZATION> fraternity brothers at the <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION> measured the bridge by using the 5-foot-7 frame of pledge <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> Reed </PERSON> <PERSON> Smoot </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> as a yardstick. The bridge was found to be precisely 364.4 Smoots and one ear long. Ever since, people crossing the <LOCATION> Charles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> over the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Avenue </LOCATION> bridge have been able to measure their progress in 10-Smoot intervals, painted on the sidewalk. The fraternity has repainted the marks twice a year. But new construction was erasing the marks. <PERSON> Smoot </PERSON>, now 48 and the executive vice president of a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, D.C.-based trade association, expressed optimism, but others worried that the <PERSON> Smoot </PERSON> would soon be moot as a unit of measure. Now, officials at the <ORGANIZATION> Metropolitan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> say that though they normally frown on defacing public property, the Smoots will stay. Just how they will be replaced is still under discussion. Possibilities include bronze bars of official <PERSON> Smoot </PERSON> length, or a Smoot-long section of the original painted concrete that would be embedded in the new bridge. Fraternity members also vow to maintain the tradition, saying they have carefully measured the Smoot-length and will repaint the new bridge. Last spring, some students proposed re-Smooting the bridge using <PERSON> Smoot </PERSON>'s son, <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Smoot </PERSON>, a junior at <ORGANIZATION> MIT </ORGANIZATION> this year. But fraternity members demurred. The son is 4 inches taller than his dad, and besides, there's no Smoot like an old <PERSON> Smoot </PERSON>.

 When <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Lash </PERSON> learned the name of his new roommate after entering the hospital to recover from a heart attack, he thought it sounded familiar. `` Is that the Gehrls from Fitzhugh Street?''

<TEXT>
 In a bid for unity among white liberals, three anti-apartheid political parties announced Saturday they have merged in anticipation of national elections this year. The formation of the new party, to be known as the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, is an attempt to broaden the political base of white liberals, who are widely seen as being in a state of disarray. The party will be launched formally in <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION> on April 8, but `` concerted planning and action begin today,'' the organization said Saturday after a meeting. The <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> will have three leaders who presently are serving as the heads of the merging parties. They are <PERSON> Zac </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Beer </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Progressive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Wynand </PERSON> <PERSON> Malan </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION>, and <PERSON> Denis </PERSON> <PERSON> Worrall </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Independent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. The Progressive <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> currently has 17 of the 178 seats in the white chamber of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, while the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION> has three and the <ORGANIZATION> Independent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> none. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, which has ruled <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> 40 years, maintains firm control of the white chamber with 133 seats, while the extreme-right <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> is the official opposition with 24 seats. A small independent party holds the 178th seat. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> has separate houses for whites, Asians and people of mixed-race, but not for the majority 26 million blacks. The liberal white parties draw their support almost exclusively from the major urban areas such as <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Durban </LOCATION>, but they have been losing some support in recent years. The three merging parties all oppose apartheid and their platforms are largely similar. They said they hope to attract whites who traditionally vote for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> but who have become disillusioned by its start-and-stop race reform. `` Our immediate objectives are the consolidation of existing membership, the recruitment of those many South Africans ... who are looking for a new political home, and the achievement of support and credibility across the political spectrum,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> said Saturday. In 1987, <PERSON> Malan </PERSON> resigned from the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> to form the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Worrall </PERSON> quit as <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s ambassador to <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> to form the <ORGANIZATION> Independent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> Both men cited disappointment with the government's slow pace of reform. The government must call an election before March 1990, and most observers believe it will be scheduled sometime this year. In neighboring <LOCATION> Zimbabwe </LOCATION>, a group of white South African lawyers and black officials of the <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> ended a meeting Saturday with a call for the formation of a multiparty democracy in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. A communique released jointly by 30 South Africa-based attorneys and law academics and about 15 exiled <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> officials said a consensus was reached that there is a need to create conditions so <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s whites and blacks have equal rights. It was the first meeting between white law academics and leaders of the <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION>, the largest guerrilla organization fighting the South African government.

 Moslem insurgents surround the key city of <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION> and will launch a major attack on it if the communist defenders do not surrender soon, guerrilla leaders said Saturday. The leaders decided at a meeting at <PERSON> Ghazi </PERSON> <PERSON> Abad </PERSON>, about 15 miles outside <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION>, to press their siege of the city so that no supplies get through to Afghan army forces. The insurgents said <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION>, about 90 miles east of the Afghan capital of <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>, could be the first major city to fall after the Soviets complete their military withdrawal from the nation. <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION>'s fall would weaken the defenses of <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> and open up the highway to the capital, the guerrillas said. <PERSON> Abdul </PERSON> <PERSON> Zaher </PERSON>, a senior commander of the <ORGANIZATION> Jamiat-i-Islami </ORGANIZATION> guerrilla group, said the insurgents do not want to attack the crowded city for fear of injuring civilians. But the guerrillas will have no choice if Afghan troops attempt to hold out, and an assault could come within 10 days, <PERSON> Zaher </PERSON> said. The guerrilla forces are moving to take control of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> when the Soviets complete their pullout. Under a U.N.-mediated accord, the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> is suposed to be out of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> by Feb. 15. It entered the country in 1979 to back Afghan troops in their war with Moslem guerrillas. Occasional artillery fire from government forces outside <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION> could be heard Saturday, but guerrillas appeared in control of the surrounding countryside. Trucks and buses filled with heavily armed insurgents moved up the highways leading to the city, and <PERSON> Zaher </PERSON> said up to 12,000 guerrillas surrounded <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION>. He said there were an undetermined but much smaller number of Afghan troops and that they were demoralized. `` There are only a few communists who still want to fight,'' <PERSON> Zaher </PERSON> said. But the guerrillas did not appear to have artillery or other heavy weapons they might need for a decisive attack. <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION> was a major Soviet army and air base and reportedly has powerful defenses. The guerrillas plan to blockade supply routes and then expect <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> and other cities to fall quickly. `` The fighting will end when the Russians withdraw, an Islamic government is established and the communists surrender,'' <PERSON> Zaher </PERSON> said. Guerrilla forces have taken over and occupied all government army bases and outposts along the main highway connecting <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION> to the Pakistani border about 45 miles away. Burned out government tanks, armored personnel carriers and trucks destroyed in fighting last month are strewn along the road. A large explosion Saturday near the guerrilla base at <PERSON> Ghazi </PERSON> <PERSON> Abad </PERSON> was caused by a long-range rocket fired by government forces, guerrillas said. There was no sign of Afghan air force planes and the insurgents said there had been no air attacks in the area in recent days. Some guerrilla leaders, fearing civilian casualties, have said they do not want to launch major attacks on cities. But others said privately that some of the seven rival Moslem groups are pressing for quick action. After <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION> falls, the guerrillas there would reinforce the insurgents at <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Zaher </PERSON> said. He said the commanders of the guerrilla groups were cooperating in taking <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION> and that plans were under way to run the city and ensure the safety of civilians and property after its fall. Guerrilla officers also said appeals were being made at mosques to avoid unnecessary bloodshed. `` We're fighting only the communists. Do not harm the good people when we take <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>, do not loot or kill,'' an Islamic mullah, or priest, said in a sermon broadcast over loudspeakers Saturday in one area held by insurgents. Some Western aid officials and Afghans have expressed fears of bloodshed, reprisals and looting by vengeful guerrillas. `` We do n't want any bad things to happen,'' <PERSON> Zaher </PERSON> said.

 More than one ton of herbal ointments are being used to preserve the body of the late <PERSON> Panchen </PERSON> <PERSON> Lama </PERSON>, the official <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said Saturday. <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> said the preservatives included borneol, sandalwood powder and safflowers.

 <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s leading dissident, <PERSON> Fang </PERSON> <PERSON> Lizhi </PERSON>, took his message straight to the establishment Saturday by telling a party attended by hundreds of actors, scientists, and businessmen they should work for human rights. `` Some people think <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> does n't need democracy, but I think human rights is basic,'' <PERSON> Fang </PERSON> said in a strong voice. Until his speech, the tea party had been non-political with some guests volunteering songs and stories. `` For -LRB- human rights -RRB- to be realized, first of all famous people must take a stand,'' he told the audience, which included many local leaders in the arts, science and trade. <PERSON> Fang </PERSON> and several other leading intellectuals were expelled from the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> in 1987 after nationwide student demonstrations for democracy. More recently, authorities punished <PERSON> Fang </PERSON> for his outspokenness by revoking his permission to spend six months this year at the <ORGANIZATION> Colorado </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Astrophysics </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Fang </PERSON>, who is also known for his work as an astrophysicist, has made many pro-democracy speech to groups of sympathizers, particularly students. However, Saturday was the first time he took his message of democracy and human rights to an establishment audience. The party at a local hotel was organized by the <ORGANIZATION> Chinese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Entrepreneurial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> to celebrate the upcoming Lunar New Year. Both groups are state-run. `` Some people came up to me afterward and said they agreed with what I said,'' <PERSON> Fang </PERSON> said after his speech, which ended to tepid applause. But he acknowledged that not everyone in the audience was happy. `` I will speak out more in the future to such groups,'' <PERSON> Fang </PERSON> said. `` I think there will be more and more discussions among intellectuals ... because the government right now is very weak due to economic problems. Even inside the party, they ca n't agree on things.'' <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> is trying to control inflation of more than 20 percent, shortages of energy and raw materials, and growing corruption.

<HEAD>International Aid Fund For Northern Ireland Revamped In Wake Of Criticism</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER CALLAHAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 An international fund designed to promote peace in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> through economic revitalization has been overhauled following criticism that some of the money was given to programs such as a parachute club, a congressman says. The International Fund for <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>, an outgrowth of the 1985 Anglo-Irish pact, sought to ease the two decades of violence between Catholics and Protestants in British-ruled <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> by improving economic conditions, thereby reducing deep-seeded resentments. The fund, run by an independent commission appointed jointly by <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and the republic of <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>, fuels economic projects across <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> and in border counties in the republic, areas where both tensions and unemployment run rampant. The program got off the ground in 1986 largely due to a three-year, $ 120 million <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid package pushed personally by two of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s most famous Irishmen, <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and then-House Speaker <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Neill </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, D-Mass. But concern has grown over how the agency is doling out the money. `` Up until this point, the policy of the fund has been to spread the money around, take what I call a scatter-gun approach to it, under the theory that all areas in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> and the border counties have been affected by the troubles. And that's true,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Donnelly </PERSON>, D-Mass. `` But the reality is some areas have been affected more than others.'' Some of the projects backed by International Fund grants have been praised, such as the creation of an industrial park for fledgling businessmen near the Protestant-Catholic divide in <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION>. But others have come under sharp criticism, including the refurbishing of a bank, which later returned the grant, and aid for a parachute school, which fund officials said was given to help promote tourism and lift the local economy. More importantly, according to <PERSON> Donnelly </PERSON>, some <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> nationalists who oppose British rule of <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> felt they were being excluded from the program. The money, he said, was not always going to the neediest areas. <PERSON> Donnelly </PERSON>, an <PERSON> O'Neill </PERSON> protege who has led the fight in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> for Irish aid since the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> speaker retired two years ago, met with fund officials in <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> last month and was told the system recently has been revamped. The fund now will target grants to areas most adversely affected by the violence and economic depression, such as <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION>, he said. Fund managers also have hired their own staff to help nationalist communities apply for grants. `` My position has been that if mistakes have been made, and I think some have, I think the fund managers have learned from them and let's wait and see what the next go-round of grants bring,'' <PERSON> Donnelly </PERSON> said in an interview last week. <PERSON> Donnelly </PERSON>, chairman of the Friends of <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> caucus in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, and other leading proponents of Irish aid, including Sen. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, D-Mass., and his nephew, Rep. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON>, D-Mass., are prepared to push for more money for the fund this Sen. <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> said he was optimistic <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> would continue to support the fund despite the criticism. `` Encouraging economic development is one of the most effective roles that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> can play in ending the conflict,'' the senator said. But <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> financing for the program has remained a tenuous proposition since the three-year package ran its course last year. Levels that had averaged $ 40 million a year for the first three years were reduced to about $ 10 million last year. <PERSON> Donnelly </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Irish </LOCATION> officials attribute the decrease to budget constraints within <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> rather than a dissatisfaction with the program, but others say criticisms of the program are expected to result in it being carefully scrutinized on Capitol Hill this year. <PERSON> Donnelly </PERSON> predicts <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> will continue to fund the program, but concedes it was never a <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> favorite. `` <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> personally supported it, but I think within the bureaucracy -LRB- at State -RRB- there has been less than enthusiasm,'' he said. The current <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> budget, as the previous one, proposed no money for the Irish fund.

<HEAD>Recommendation To End Combat Bonus Signals Peace In Persian Gulf</HEAD>
<HEAD>EDS: CORRECTS byline.</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The general in charge of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Central Command has recommended suspension of combat pay for sailors in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> sources say. The recommendation, under review by the <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chiefs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Staff </ORGANIZATION>, is the strongest indication yet that American defense officials believe the truce between <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> may hold. The `` imminent danger'' bonuses, previously known as hostile fire or combat pay, are worth $ 110 a month and have been paid to servicemen working inside the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> since August 1987. Precise figures were not available last week, but <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> officials estimated 4,000 servicemen were receiving the payments. At that rate, the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> would save $ 440,000 a month by dropping them. The defense sources insisted, however, that the recommendation had nothing to do with budget concerns. According to the officials, who declined to be identified by name, the recommendation was forwarded to Adm. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Crowe </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chiefs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Staff </ORGANIZATION>, `` within the last month or so. It came from Gen. <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> Schwarzkopf </PERSON>, who assumed command of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Central Command last November and `` believes the threat has now receded to the point'' where it is difficult to justify the payments, said one source. `` And the fact that we've gone to a different regime _ one of monitoring ship traffic instead of actually escorting tankers directly _ changes things, too,'' the source added. Another source said the staff that serves the nation's highest council of military officers `` is hard at work reviewing the recommendation and its ramifications.'' `` A final position should be presented to -LRB- <PERSON> Crowe </PERSON> -RRB- within the next month, but there does n't appear to be any reason to maintain the payments,'' the source said. The Central Command is the organization responsible for American military operations in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Indian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> region. As such, it is the parent command for the Joint Task Force <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, the unit responsible for guaranteeing the safety of merchant ships flying the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> flag in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>. The administration of former President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> agreed in the spring of 1987 to extend American military protection to 11 Kuwaiti tankers after they switched to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> registry. <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>, a friend of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and a key ally of <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, had found that its ships had become special targets for Iranian forces. In August 1987, one month after the first U.S.-escorted Kuwaiti tanker ran into an underwater mine, the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> announced it would start making the payments to the crews of warships operating inside the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> gulf </LOCATION>, the Strait of Hormuz and a small portion of the Gulf of <LOCATION> Oman </LOCATION>, as well as to personnel stationed in <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Bahrain </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> agreed to a truce last August in their bloody, 8-year-old war and the cease-fire has held. As a result, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has slowly reduced the number of warships operating in the region and stopped conducting closely supervised convoy runs. Instead, the ships now in the region maintain what the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> calls a `` monitoring regime'' of keeping U.S.-flaged tankers within radar or radio range. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> now has 14 ships inside the Gulf, including six small mine-sweepers. According to the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> sources, even if <PERSON> Schwarzkopf </PERSON>'s recommendation is approved, some minor exceptions might be made to continue the payments to the sailors on the mine-sweepers Those men are still actively engaged each day in hunting for floating mines, the officials noted. The authority to make imminent danger payments was provided to the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> in 1983 under an amendment to a law that had previously established procedures for providing hostile fire, or combat, pay. The new law specified that danger pay could be provided to servicemen deployed in areas where there was a risk of terrorism or other physical threats, even though <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> forces were not directly involved in combat.

I told him to try to calm down and said it was a little late to think about that.'' Police held the 16-year-old at the Children's <ORGANIZATION> Detention </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, pending a review by the district attorney's office. Bethly and another teen-age boy were playing dice in the den in the home of the boy with the gun, <PERSON> Bruess </PERSON> said. The 16-year-old pulled out an old .22 - caliber pistol he had found when <PERSON> Bethly </PERSON> and the other boy refused to pay dimes they lost on a roll of dice, <PERSON> Bruess </PERSON> `` He pulls out the gun and was flashing it around,'' <PERSON> Bruess </PERSON> said. `` He threatened to kill them if they did n't pay up.'' One boy surrendered his dime, but <PERSON> Bethly </PERSON> refused. The gun went off accidentally, the older boy told police. The grandmother of the 16-year-old said she was sure the shooting was accidental. `` They were both born in my house and grew up together,'' she said. `` I do n't think they'd get mad enough at each other to do something like that.''

<HEAD>Same Judge, Same Legal Dilemmas in North Trial and Watergate</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DONALD M. ROTHBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The intense publicity, the fight over secret documents, the legal dilemmas posed at the trial of <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON> rouse memories of a celebrated Watergate trial at which <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Gerhard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> also presided. As he began jury selection last week in the trial of the former <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> aide, the white-haired judge with the no-nonsense manner followed procedures he used more than 14 years ago for the so-called Plumbers trial. A defendant in that case was an aide from an earlier White House _ <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Ehrlichman </PERSON>, former chief domestic adviser to <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>. Courtroom No. 6 on the second floor of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Courthouse </ORGANIZATION> was the scene of that trial, as it is the North trial. There are other similarities. Like North, <PERSON> Ehrlichman </PERSON> was a prodigious note-taker who contended his files were essential to his defense. Like North, <PERSON> Ehrlichman </PERSON> had starred on television as a featured witness at hearings watched by millions of Americans. Like North, <PERSON> Ehrlichman </PERSON>'s role in a White House scandal was the subject of front-page stories that intrigued a nation for months before his case came to trial. Despite the torrent of publicity, it took <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> just two days to seat a jury for the Plumbers trial _ named for the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> unit established to plug leaks of classified information. Only three potential jurors were dismissed because they said they doubted they could render an impartial verdict. But the North trial presents <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> with a problem he did n't face 14 years ago. <PERSON> Ehrlichman </PERSON> did n't have immunity when he testified before the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Watergate committee. <PERSON> North </PERSON> did have a guarantee his testimony before the congressional Iran-Contra committee could n't be used against him. Dozens of prospective jurors have been dismissed from the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> trial because they said they heard <PERSON> North </PERSON> testify to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> that he committed crimes. The search for an untainted jury in the North trial `` is exacerbated by the immunity,'' said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Ben-Veniste </PERSON>, one of the Watergate prosecutors. `` This case has more problems than any I've ever seen,'' said <PERSON> Ben-Veniste </PERSON>, who played a leading role in the trial of former <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> administration officials convicted on charges stemming from the break-in at <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> headquarters in the Watergate office building. What has struck some observers of the North trial is the search for people who had no curiosity about the Iran-Contra scandal when it was unfolding in televised hearings. `` Whether they will differ from normal, average jurors remains to be seen,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Howell </PERSON> <PERSON> Heflin </PERSON>, D-Ala., a former state supreme court judge who served on the Iran-Contra committee `` If a man never saw anything of it, what type of individual is he?'' `` I would n't want people who lived in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, the seat of government, on that jury who were so uninformed,'' said <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Moffitt </PERSON>, a criminal defense attorney. The magnitude of <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON>'s problem was illustrated by the case of a prospective juror disqualified because she worked at a <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Roebuck </ORGANIZATION> store where dozens of TV sets were turned on when <PERSON> North </PERSON> testified in July 1987. The woman has not watched the testimony, but her exposure to it was such that the judge decided to remove her from the panel of potential jurors. Documents are another common issue. In both cases, <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> made extraordinary appeals to the president, but the tone of each was quite different. In the North case, <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> urged President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> to decide whether massive amounts of classified information <PERSON> North </PERSON> contended was vital to his defense could be released. `` The court has a very limited role,'' said <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON>, adding that the Constitution provides that it is up to the president `` not North or any witness, to protect the prerogatives of the president's office if he deems them unduly threatened. North had sought some 40,000 pages of documents. When the president refused to release material _ saying `` these are things that are national security secrets'' _ conspiracy charges against <PERSON> North </PERSON> were dropped. <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> never implied he thought the White House was withholding material simply to block prosecution of the man <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> had once referred to as `` a national hero.'' The judge's attitude was very different when he came into conflict with the <ORGANIZATION> Nixon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> over <PERSON> Ehrlichman </PERSON>'s request to have access to his files. When the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> said that only the defendant, not his lawyer, would be allowed into the room where the files were kept, <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> responded scathingly. `` I do n't see how I can agree to a procedure that is so totally offensive,'' he said. `` It is offensive, sir, it borders on obstruction,'' he told <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> Clair </PERSON>, the lawyer representing <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> at various proceedings then underway to examine the president's role in Watergate.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Jamaica </LOCATION>'s 10,000 soldiers and police officers voted Saturday so they will be free to maintain order during the parliamentary election later this week. Civic groups called for peaceful balloting. Eight people have reportedly been shot or hacked to death in political violence between supporters of rival parties since Prime Minister <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Seaga </PERSON> launched the campaign Jan. 15. Thursday will be the first nationally contested election since 1980, when 700 people were killed in political violence over a nine-month campaign. More than 3,000 members of the <ORGANIZATION> Jamaica </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> and 7,000 members of the <ORGANIZATION> Constabulary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> voted Saturday in special polling stations across this <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> island of 2.3 million. Security forces traditionally vote several days before elections to devote themselves to maintaining order on election day. <PERSON> Seaga </PERSON> on Friday signed an order calling into service hundreds of army reservists to assist security forces in maintaining order during the week before balloting. Twenty private sector and civic groups are calling on `` all good people in this country'' to wear blue from Monday to Thursday next week in support of peace, the groups' spokesman, <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Thwaites </PERSON>, said Friday. `` We are asking the churches to take this call to their congregations,'' he said. `` Wear something blue to show that you are for peace; a blue garment, a blue ribbon, a blue tassel.''

<HEAD>Steel Employees Get Closing Notice; But Jobs Still Leaving</HEAD>

 <PERSON> Fritz </PERSON> <PERSON> Wagner </PERSON> once lost a job with less than a week's notice, so he appreciated getting two months' warning of the closing of <ORGANIZATION> Lehigh </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Structural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>'s fabricating plant. That notice under a new federal law is only so much help, though. `` You're out of a job no matter how you look at it,'' <PERSON> Wagner </PERSON>, 23, said Friday in a drizzle at the lunch truck outside the 70-year-old factory. <ORGANIZATION> Lehigh </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Structural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steel </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Leslie </PERSON> <PERSON> Mullen </PERSON>, citing inability to compete in the <LOCATION> Northeast </LOCATION> with Canadian companies, announced Jan. 24 that the company would shut down most of its <LOCATION> Allentown </LOCATION> operations permanently by March 24, putting about 185 of 225 employees out of work. A new law that took effect Saturday requires companies with 100 or more full-time employees to give 60 days' notice of plant closings or major layoffs. Under some interpretations of the law, <ORGANIZATION> Lehigh </ORGANIZATION> had to give notice even before the Feb. 4 effective date, and the company provided it. `` It's not like you can come in one day and the doors are locked,'' <PERSON> Wagner </PERSON> said. The notice, he said, means `` now we've got a chance'' to look for other jobs. A union official said that notice may not be a big help for many of his members, but said company officials have been straightforward. `` They're abiding by the plant-closing law. They've been really cooperative,'' secretary-treasurer <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Kontier </PERSON> of Local 548 of the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bridge </ORGANIZATION>, Structural and Ornamental Ironworkers union. The law does n't require that each employee receives 60 days' notice, because some employees may be laid off before a plant closes entirely `` They just said the plant's shutting down. Then I got a three-day layoff notice,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Shelby </PERSON>, a punch operator at the plant for five years who was one of seven or eight workers laid off Friday. He said he thought he should have received more notice. Even with 60 days' notice, job counseling under way and retraining to start soon, <PERSON> Kontier </PERSON> said, the law may not get his members quickly back to work. He said they will first search in vain for jobs that pay near the steel plant's average $ 10 to $ 11 an hour, plus benefits including health insurance. He wants to see more government efforts to keep companies in business, particularly in making sure foreign companies do n't get an unfair advantage in markets. But those would be too late for this company. Gradual layoffs began in January and one fabricating shop closed a week ago, with another scheduled to close this week, said plant superintendent <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Weiss </PERSON>, who at 59 will be looking for a job himself. By the target closing date of the entire plant in April, the last shop will have finished the remaining steelwork for a 41-story building in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Weiss </PERSON> said about 30 employees will be needed for the last stage. The shutdown plans surprised <PERSON> Wagner </PERSON>, who began work at the plant last May. He liked the idea of the new law, but little did he know as politicians fussed over its passage last year that it would affect him. `` I had no feeling at all. When I started in May, I thought my job was set,'' said <PERSON> Wagner </PERSON>, who bought a house last September and was married in October. `` I thought I could retire here.'' `` My whole family worked here,'' he said. `` My grandfather was here when they opened the plant.''

<HEAD>GAO Says Problems With New Bomber Persist</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DONNA CASSATA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Major problems still plaguing the B-1B bomber may reduce its expected range and payload capability, says a report issued by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>' investigative arm. The <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> concluded in its report that although the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> has made progress in correcting certain deficiencies in the Rockwell-built bomber, problems in the bomber's performance persist `` Several areas critical to B-1B's mission performance have not yet been demonstrated,'' the report said. The review also said the cost of the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> plane could be up to $ 400 million each if the service goes ahead with all the planned improvements. Those problems mean the B-1B may not have the range it was designed to have or be able to carry all the bombs and missiles planned for it, the report said. The bomber is designed to carry conventional and nuclear gravity bombs, cruise missiles and short-range attack missiles. Specifically, the report said the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> has not made progress in resolving problems with the B-1B's defensive avionics. `` In short, it is now known that the defensive avionics can not meet specifications without a major redesign,'' the report said. The defensive avionics, or electronic countermeasures system, was designed to improve the bomber's probability of penetrating the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> by allowing the aircraft's crew to `` avoid, degrade and deceive the Soviet air defenses,'' the report said. The problems involve the system's radar warning receiver and processor function. The report also said that data for the bomber indicate that reported fuel leaks have for the most part remained the same over the last year. Elimination of the fuel leaks is probably not possible, according to the report, which noted that the fuel cells are part of the airframe and seals and joints are subjected to flight stress. The B-1, killed by then-President <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> in 1977, was resurrected four years later by former President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, who said 100 of the swing-wing planes were needed to update the nation's aging force of nuclear-armed bombers. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> ordered 100 of the planes, at a cost of $ 20.5 billion. Three have crashed, leaving the service with 97 B-1Bs. The <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> has already received all the B-1s it intends to buy and is now proceeding with plans to buy the radar-evading B-2 stealth bomber.

<HEAD>Soviets Learn Shocking Figure that 40 Million Repressed Under Stalin</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANDREW KATELL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The number Soviets have wondered about for more than 30 years appeared in print Saturday: more than 40 million arrested, killed or otherwise repressed in the bloody political terror of <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>. In the most detailed account of <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>'s victims reported in the Soviet press, the weekly tabloid Arguments and Facts said 15 million people died because of the dictator who took power in 1924. Its article came as a daily newspaper reported bullet-fractured skulls were found in what may be a mass grave of <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>'s victims. Although figures on <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>'s victims have been known to Westerners, Soviets have not seen them published officially. Almost every Soviet living today had relatives who suffered under <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>, and since his death in 1953 they have hoped to put a number on the human toll. Historian <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Medvedev </PERSON> gave the 40 million figure to Arguments and Facts and said it included all `` victims of Stalinism'' based on his own calculations. The toll was much higher than previous vague estimates. In 1987, Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said `` many thousands of people ... were subjected to wholesale repressive measures'' under <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>. Western historians believe 20 million Soviets died under <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>. The same number of Soviets were killed in World War II. <PERSON> Medvedev </PERSON> said 6 million to 7 million people were killed in an early 1930s famine, 5 million to 7 million were executed or died in labor camps after mass arrests in the late 1930s, and 1 million died during forced relocations of ethnic minorities during World War II. Also Saturday, the daily <ORGANIZATION> Sovietskaya </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rossiya </ORGANIZATION> reported construction workers discovered a mass grave Jan. 19 in <LOCATION> Gorno-Altai </LOCATION>, 1,900 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. Human remains they found include 50 skulls of men 30 to 50 years old who were shot through the temple or back of the head, it said. Before World War II, a greenhouse and vegetable storage facility were on the site, next to a camp for political prisoners run by the dreaded <ORGANIZATION> NKVD </ORGANIZATION> secret police, the newspaper said. Investigating prosecutor <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gushchina </PERSON> told the newspaper: `` One thing is clear: a tragedy happened here.'' <ORGANIZATION> Sovietskaya </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rossiya </ORGANIZATION> likened the killing field to one found last year in <LOCATION> Kuropaty </LOCATION>, in the Byelorussian republic. Authorities said that field is a mass graveyard for at least 30,000 people killed from 1937-1941, apparently for political reasons. <PERSON> Medvedev </PERSON>, a dissident historian who recently has received official backing, gave Arguments and Facts this breakdown for <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>'s victims: _ From 1927-1929, about 1 million Soviets were jailed or in exile Most were former members of political opposition groups and figures in Soviet founder <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lenin </PERSON>'s New Economic Policy. _ From 1930-1932, 9-11 million peasants were deported to <LOCATION> Siberia </LOCATION> and other remote regions or fled to cities when <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> forced collectivization of Soviet agriculture At least 1 million more peasants were deported in 1933. _ From 1932-1933, 6 million to 7 million people died in a famine blamed on <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>'s policies _ About 1.5 million to 2 million other peasants were arrested for violating `` extremely cruel'' laws on state property _ In 1935, 1 million former officials, merchants and nobelmen were branded `` class strangers'' and deported from <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> and other cities _ Five million to 7 million people were arrested in the `` Great Terror'' of 1937-38 One million of them were sentenced to death. The rest were sent to labor camps, where most died. _ Mass repressions struck 1 million people from 1939-1941 in the <LOCATION> Baltic </LOCATION> republics and western sections of the <LOCATION> Ukraine </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Byelorussia </LOCATION> _ During World War II, up to 2 million ethnic Germans were deported About 3 million Moslems were forced to move. A million of those deported died. _ After 1940, 2 million to 3 million people were arrested for reporting late to work, a crime punishable by up to five years in a labor camp _ From 10 million to 12 million Soviets were deprived of certain rights or sent to labor camps because they lived in areas the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION> occupied during the war _ Between 1 million and 1.5 million people were arrested 1946-53 for political reasons <PERSON> Medvedev </PERSON> was expelled from the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> in 1969 and his major works on <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>'s repressions and other once-taboo topics were banned from publication. Under <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s policy of glasnost or openness, he is back in favor.

<HEAD>Moslems March in Soviet Republic to Press Religious Demands</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 More than 200 Soviet Moslems marched from a mosque through the Uzbek capital of <LOCATION> Tashkent </LOCATION> to press the government to take up their religious demands, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> reported Saturday. The official news agency said the demonstrators from the Central Asian republics of <LOCATION> Uzbekistan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kazakhstan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Tadzhikistan </LOCATION> demanded state intervention in certain religious matters. However, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> did not elaborate. `` Slogans of the group were of strictly religious character,'' it said. The march occurred Friday after a crowded service at a <LOCATION> Tashkent </LOCATION> mosque, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. It said the Moslems disrupted traffic and police restored order without using force during the three-hour gathering. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said Uzbek Premier <PERSON> Gairat </PERSON> <PERSON> Kadyrov </PERSON> met with 25 of the demonstrators and told them their demands should be addressed by the clergy, not the government. Regional religious leaders were to discuss the demands Monday, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. In a country whose government espouses atheism, the population includes an estimated 45 million to 50 million Moslems, the largest minority after ethnic Russians. The Moslems are increasing in number much more rapidly than ethnic Russians, who hold the reins of political power. Based on current trends, the Moslem population will rise to 100 million by the year 2000, meaning one in every three Soviets will be Moslem. The Kremlin has expressed concern that Islamic fundamentalism across the border in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> could spread to Soviet Moslems.

 Two tremors on Saturday rocked the area of <LOCATION> Tadzhikistan </LOCATION> where an earthquake and mudslide killed 274 people last month, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> reported. No damage or injuries were reported. Also Saturday, the official news agency said a high-level commission was unhappy with reconstruction of the area of <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> devastated by a Dec. 7 quake that killed an estimated 25,000 people. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said two tremors measuring 4 on the 12-point Soviet scale jolted the area of <LOCATION> Gissar </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Tadzhikistan </LOCATION>, 1,800 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>. On Friday, tremors of 4 and 2-3 points were reported, it said. A tremor of 4 points can shake objects such as dishes and windows and cause doors and walls to creak. A 40-second earthquake struck <LOCATION> Tadzhikistan </LOCATION> on Jan. 23, loosening layers of mud that tumbled through mountain villages 20 miles southwest of the republic's capital, <LOCATION> Dushanbe </LOCATION>. In the Armenian capital, <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION>, a commission of the country's ruling Politburo met Saturday and lashed out at construction officials for dragging their feet in rebuilding the city of <LOCATION> Spitak </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> reported The commission said the delays could seriously set back rebuilding plans. <LOCATION> Spitak </LOCATION> was one of the hardest hit areas by the December earthquake, and the town is to be rebuilt several miles away from its current location. The current location is right at the convergence of three earthquake faults. The Kremlin has promised to rebuild northwestern <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> in two years. The panel said that to speed reconstruction, it was ordering increases in local production of building materials such as sand, stone and gravel. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said the sanitary and health conditions in the disaster area remained poor. It said the danger of epidemics will increase as spring approaches and the weather warms up.

 Israeli troops shot and killed two <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> teen-agers in the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> on Saturday in one of the bloodiest clashes in the Palestinian uprising in several weeks. A <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> worker also was wounded in the confrontation in the crowded <PERSON> Khan </PERSON> <PERSON> Younis </PERSON> refugee camp, the first international relief worker to be hurt in the 14-month uprising. Arab hospital officials said at least 23 protesters were wounded in the camp. Six other Palestinians were shot in scattered clashes throughout the southern <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, and one was shot in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> town of <LOCATION> Qalqilya </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> reporters and hospital officials said. The army spokesman confirmed the two deaths but said only 16 were wounded, all in the refugee camp. The army imposed a curfew on the Khan Younis camp and ordered its 35,000 residents to stay in their homes until further notice. Since the uprising began Dec. 8, 1987, 373 Palestinians and 15 Israelis have been killed. The boys killed Saturday were identified as 15-year-old <PERSON> Allah </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdullah </PERSON> <PERSON> Arandez </PERSON> and 16-year-old <PERSON> Maged </PERSON> <PERSON> Jawdat </PERSON> <PERSON> Ihlak </PERSON>. A military spokesman said troops had no choice but to open fire with plastic bullets to disperse a group of women and masked youths who surrounded their lookout point and attacked it with rocks. <PERSON> Arandez </PERSON> was shot in the chest and died after he was taken to the camp's <PERSON> Nasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Hospital </PERSON>, an Arab reporter said. The reporter said <PERSON> Arandez </PERSON> was the second son in his family to be killed in the revolt against Israeli rule in the occupied lands. <PERSON> Sabri </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdullah </PERSON> <PERSON> Arandez </PERSON>, 26, was killed in clashes with troops in November, the reporter said. The <PERSON> Arandez </PERSON> family snatched <PERSON> Allah </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdullah </PERSON>'s body from the hospital and hastily buried him, a common Palestinian practice aimed at preventing the army from taking a body for an autopsy. Following <PERSON> Arandez </PERSON>'s funeral, clashes broke out anew. <PERSON> Ihlak </PERSON> was shot, and 23 other protesters were reportedly wounded. <PERSON> Ihlak </PERSON> died of a chest wound while undergoing surgery, <ORGANIZATION> Nasser </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> officials said. As troops fired tear gas and rubber and plastic bullets in an attempt to disperse protesters, an <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> worker was shot in the leg, military and <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> officials said. <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonin </PERSON>, 30, who was helping in the evacuation of wounded when he was struck by a plastic bullet.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Vice President <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> is back home from his first foray abroad for the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration, apparently with neither great gaffes nor startling accomplishments to show for his largely symbolic mission to <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, meeting in <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION> with world leaders at a presidential inauguration, signaled <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration sensitivity to <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and then went to <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> where he delivered a stern human rights message to the U.S.-backed government. The Latins had waited with great curiosity to size up the new vice president while his own countrymen watched to see how he would handle his first major assignment from President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. Foreign service officials nervously hoped he would not live down to campaign criticisms that he was not up to the job of vice president. By many accounts from both <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and foreign officials, the diplomatic greenhorn acquitted himself well on the international stage, even displaying a certain verve for his mission. In <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>, where his job was mostly to spread goodwill, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s affable, political style was a hit with Latin leaders who place great store in `` personalismo,'' one member of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> delegation said. `` I was skeptical but I'm impressed,'' said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Skol </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> specialist who traveled with <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>. After one day of meetings, <PERSON> Skol </PERSON> said, `` He's making the right political moves, the right body language. ... He's not saying too much when he should n't say too much.'' In <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, a harder line was called for as <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> went before some 20 military officers who lead the nation's 56,000-member armed forces. He delivered what was described by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials as an emphatic admonition on the need for progress in curbing human rights abuses. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> took that same message to the country's political and business leaders, leaving a clear message that future <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid will be linked to the country's success on human rights. In <LOCATION> Caracas </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> was a less dominant figure in the company of some 20 heads of state and countless seasoned diplomats at the inauguration of President <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Andres </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON>. Aside from <PERSON> Perez </PERSON>, the center stage figure was the larger-than-life <PERSON> Fidel </PERSON> <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>. He was ubiquitous on television screens and he sat not far from <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> at the inauguration. The two did not speak to each other. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s hectic schedule during two days in <LOCATION> Caracas </LOCATION> included bilateral meetings with 10 heads of state, and less formal meetings with about the same number. While the former senator's diplomatic inexperience did not go unnoticed, that was not necessarily a negative factor in these get-acquainted sessions, according to those familiar with them. `` The vice president left behind some extremely positive feelings. He was well informed but at the same time he elicited the opinions of the leaders he met with in a very sincere way,'' said <PERSON> Otto </PERSON> <PERSON> Reich </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassador to <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>. ` He's getting experience here,'' said <PERSON> Francisco </PERSON> <PERSON> Aguilar </PERSON> <PERSON> Urbina </PERSON>, a Harvard-educated adviser to <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> <PERSON> Arias </PERSON>. He said the Latins had been unsure what to expect, having heard mostly negative news reports about <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>. <PERSON> Urbina </PERSON> said <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, while not a particularly imposing figure, was projecting a positive image. `` They liked the fact that he went out of his way, broke with protocol and just did things with regular people,'' said a member of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> delegation. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> on two occasions mingled with ordinary Brazilians, once stopping his motorcade on the way from the airport to buy fruit at a local market. He also visited a popular plaza where he worked a crowd campaign style. A few hundred people quickly gathered and <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> stepped up to a statue of regional hero <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> <PERSON> Bolivar </PERSON> and pleased the crowd by declaring <ORGANIZATION> Bolivar </ORGANIZATION> a hero of democracy in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> as well. In his energetic, upbeat style, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> made friendly small talk to get his bilateral meetings with heads of state underway. As photographers recorded the start of their meeting, he talked with <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> about mutual acquaintances in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. With <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>'s President <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> he joked about his upcoming 42nd birthday. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> was seen as `` sensible'' by President <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Sarney </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Sarney </PERSON>'s spokesman, <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Henrique </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Almeida </PERSON>. He indicated the Brazilians also see <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> as a new guy on the job who has a lot to learn. `` They were testing each other. <PERSON> Sarney </PERSON> was very clear and open,'' without the customary diplomatic verbiage, and <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> was the same way, <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Almeida </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION>'s President <PERSON> Vinicio </PERSON> <PERSON> Cerezo </PERSON> subtly noted <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s newcomer status, saying this was `` a really good opportunity for you to come here and meet many leaders from Latin countries ... for you especially.

<TEXT>
 A man accused of falsifying his resume to gain government and police jobs in several states pleaded no contest to a theft charge and agreed to find another line of work. <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Keyser </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, 34, was fired from the city administrator's job in the tiny southeastern <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> village of <LOCATION> Kake </LOCATION> in December, one day after he was arrested on a <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> fugitive warrant. He was charged in <LOCATION> Kake </LOCATION> with felony first-degree theft for using a bogus resume to get hired and obtain $ 28,000 worth of salary, benefits and expenses. He entered his no-contest plea Friday, but it was not immediately approved by a judge. During a hearing held via telephone, <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Schultz </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Ketchikan </LOCATION> took the agreement under advisement and said he would wait for a probation report on <PERSON> Keyser </PERSON> before deciding whether to accept it. <PERSON> Keyser </PERSON>, who had been in jail in nearby <LOCATION> Petersburg </LOCATION> since his arrest, remains wanted in <LOCATION> Pikeville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>, on another theft charge stemming from his six-day stint as <LOCATION> Pikeville </LOCATION>'s city manager last August. In a plea agreement to settle the Kake charge, <PERSON> Keyser </PERSON> agreed to a jail term of up to 90 days with credit for time already served, which is about half of that. The agreement requires <PERSON> Keyser </PERSON> to pay restitution for the money he received during the 2 -LCB- months he was on the job, and would place <PERSON> Keyser </PERSON> on probation for seven years. The maximum penalties for first-degree theft are 10 years in prison and a $ 100,000 fine. <PERSON> Keyser </PERSON> also agreed not to accept any type of government employment, to sign a letter of apology to the town, and to remain in <LOCATION> Petersburg </LOCATION> while awaiting sentencing. <PERSON> Schultz </PERSON> reduced bail on both theft charges to $ 2,500 each and <PERSON> Keyser </PERSON> posted bail after Friday's hearing. Residents in <LOCATION> Kake </LOCATION>, a timber and fishing town about 75 miles south of <LOCATION> Juneau </LOCATION> on <LOCATION> Kupreanof </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, became suspicious of <PERSON> Keyser </PERSON> shortly after he took the $ 44,000-a-year job. They accused him of overspending and criticized him for refusing to release his resume for public inspection. A police records check in December revealed the outstanding <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> warrant. Interviews with prosecutors and city officials in several states revealed that at least 19 of <PERSON> Keyser </PERSON>'s jobs since 1980 have been with city or county governments. Documents and the interviews also showed <PERSON> Keyser </PERSON> used false information while obtaining at least 11 jobs. <PERSON> Kake </PERSON> officials have said they hired him because of an impressive resume and people who gave glowing references. But they now believe the resume and the references who were contacted by telephone were fraudulent. Assistant District Attorney <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> West </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Ketchikan </LOCATION> said Friday that <LOCATION> Pikeville </LOCATION> officials probably would dismiss their charge against <PERSON> Keyser </PERSON>. Last month, <LOCATION> Pikeville </LOCATION> city commissioners asked the prosecutor there to drop the charge, but the prosecutor said at the time that he wanted to continue to press the case. In <LOCATION> Pikeville </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Keyser </PERSON> is accused of theft by deception for failure to reimburse the city for $ 697 in travel expenses. <PERSON> Keyser </PERSON> declined to comment on the Kake case after the hearing. He said he planned to do community and church volunteer work while awaiting sentencing. In an interview in December, he maintained his innocence and said the charges were the result of a conspiracy in <LOCATION> Pikeville </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Keyser </PERSON> accused the news media and officials of seeking to make an example of him.

 <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> is asking the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> to investigate the possibility of swapping Latin American debts for money that would be used to clean up pollution in the <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hemisphere </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, said Saturday he is particularly interested in `` debt-for-nature'' swaps that would involve Mexican debt and cleaning up pollution along the U.S.-Mexico border, including the dumping of raw sewage into <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Grande </LOCATION>. On Friday, <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> asked <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> for an accounting of the Mexican debt situation before <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> assesses his plan. Latin American debtors have become increasingly interested in reducing their foreign debt in unconventional ways, <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said, citing `` debt-for-nature swaps'' in <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Equador </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION>, in which small quantities of their foreign debt have been converted to local currencies for investment in environmental projects. In one case, an international consortium of environmental groups purchased $ 5.6 million of Costa Rican debt from a bank in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for about $ 700,000 and converted it to a local currency bond worth $ 5.6 million, <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said. Interest on that bond will be devoted exclusively to environmental investments to protect clean air and water and promote conservation in <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION>. `` Both <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would benefit if environmental investments are stepped up along the border in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> told <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>, citing the sharp deterioration of the water in the <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Grande </LOCATION> and air pollution on the border. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said much of the $ 400 billion in Latin American debt will never be paid back, but if it could be bought at a `` deep discount'' and then traded at full value in local currency to solve such problems as sewage dumping and the chopping down of tropical rain forests, `` we'd be far ahead.'' The dumping of raw sewage into the <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Grande </LOCATION> is creating serious health threats to citizens on both sides of the border, <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said, noting that 20 million gallons of raw sewage are dumped into the river every day at <LOCATION> Nuevo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Laredo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. The enormous debt in Latin American nations has slowed their growth and `` crimped foreign exchange reserves, hurting <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> exporters,'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said. `` The sale of our manufactured exports to the 20 Latin American republics ... fell 10 percent between 1980 and 1987,'' he wrote. `` Many world-class <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> industrial firms like <ORGANIZATION> Caterpiller </ORGANIZATION> suffered declines of 50 percent or more in traditional Latin American markets.''

 Cabinet nominee <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> said Saturday he would take an unpaid leave of absence from his medical school while serving as health and human services secretary to avoid any appearance of a conflict of interest. <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Morehouse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medicine </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, had wanted to maintain his ties to the school with a paid leave, but he withdrew the request after the White House raised questions about the arrangement. `` I intend to preclude even the remotest possibility of any appearance that my actions as secretary might be influenced due to any outside income,'' <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> said in a statement released by the White House. <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> said he has asked the medical school's executive committee to grant him an unpaid leave of absence while he serves in the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration. White House spokesman <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> said an unpaid leave would mean the school `` would suspend any salary payments while he served as secretary of <ORGANIZATION> HHS </ORGANIZATION>.'' <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> earns about $ 170,000 a year from <LOCATION> Morehouse </LOCATION>, it was learned. The arrangement is designed to avoid any conflict of interest that could arise because <ORGANIZATION> Morehouse </ORGANIZATION> gets federal funds for its programs. In fiscal 1988, the school received $ 5.8 million from HHS. Federal ethics officials indicated last week that <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> would be able to receive payments from the school while serving at <ORGANIZATION> HHS </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON>, deputy director of the Office of Government Ethics, said ethics officials had met with <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> and his lawyers and `` all the problems have been worked out.'' A government source familiar with <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>'s situation said the nominee had a specific written contract entitling him to certain payments for a leave of absence, based on days of service. <ORGANIZATION> Morehouse </ORGANIZATION>, like many academic institutions, gives its faculty paid sabbatical leaves based on years of service. <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> was allowed a paid sabbatical after 13 years of uninterupted service, the White House said. The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>, in Saturday's editions, quoted a friend of <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>'s as saying the nominee had accrued about $ 300,000 worth of sabbatical leave. But <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> said in his statement, `` President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has called on all of those in his Cabinet ... to set the very highest ethical standards, and to avoid even the appearance of potential conflicts of interest. I agree emphatically with the president.'' <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>'s decision resolves one of the issues that has held up his confirmation hearings in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> last week postponed <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>'s confirmation hearings indefinitely at the request of the White House The panel is awaiting completion of an <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> background check that is focusing in part on <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>'s ties to <PERSON> Reginald </PERSON> <PERSON> Eaves </PERSON>, a suspended <LOCATION> Fulton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ga. </LOCATION>, commissioner who has been convicted of extortion. In a matter unrelated to the extortion case, Eaves was paid more than $ 34,000 over four years as a lecturer at <LOCATION> Morehouse </LOCATION> while using his seat on the commission to promote matters beneficial to the school. He reportedly gave two lectures at <LOCATION> Morehouse </LOCATION> over the four years. The Eaves controversy, however, does not appear to threaten <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>'s confirmation, according to lawmakers.

 A measles epidemic in the <LOCATION> Portuguese </LOCATION> capital has killed five children, and 200 have been hospitalized, the country's news agency said Saturday. <ORGANIZATION> Lusa </ORGANIZATION> quoted an official of the independent doctors' trade union as saying the death toll could be higher.

<TEXT>
 Experts on Saturday safely disposed of a 2,000-pound German bomb that had been buried since the World War II blitz in the city's East End. Several hundred people were evacuated from their homes Friday night after construction workers unearthed the huge bomb at a building site. <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> bomb disposal officers were called to the scene and worked through the night, police at <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION> Yard headquarters said. Because the bomb was considered too dangerous to try to transport out of the area, the army experts steamed explosives out of the shell and conducted a controlled explosion of the detonator, police and the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> said. At least 20 roads in the area were closed to traffic. The bomb was found 15 feet below ground in <LOCATION> Whitechapel </LOCATION>, an area of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> most famous for the five unsolved <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> the Ripper murders of 1888. Bombs that were dropped during the war and failed to go off are periodically unearthed in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. The Germans bombed the East End especially heavily in a bid to cripple the docks there. The latest find was one of the largest bombs unearthed in recent years.

 Nearly a quarter of the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> population of trumpeter swans is in danger of starvation at their winter feeding grounds in eastern <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Fish and <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> officials say. Service biologist <PERSON> Signe </PERSON> <PERSON> Sather-Blair </PERSON> blames the 1988 drought and current arctic cold for preventing the birds from getting their normal food. They are not on the endangered species list, but they are on <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>'s Sensitive Species list. The swans feed on aquatic plants, and low water in <PERSON> Henry </PERSON>'s Fork of the <LOCATION> Snake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> near <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> has been frozen over. The roughly 500 birds are unable to break through the ice to reach their food. Elsewhere in <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, the cold and accompanying high wind has interfered with state efforts to transplant bighorn sheep by helicopter. In an attempt to rescue the swans, Fish and Wildlife was granted 1,600 acre-feet of water from irrigators in the <LOCATION> Snake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Water </LOCATION> <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> and also received $ 8,000 from the Nature Conservancy to purchase an additional 3,200 acre-feet of water. However, wildlife biologist <PERSON> Ruth </PERSON> <PERSON> Gail </PERSON>, who has studied the swans for the Idaho Fish and Game Department, said Friday that the increased water flow had not broken up the ice on the river. `` There is no way to measure what condition they are in now,'' Ms. <PERSON> Gail </PERSON> said of the swans. `` But it's pretty grim. They've had decreased food supplies for 2 -LCB- months already this winter.'' Ms. <PERSON> Gail </PERSON> said other swans, as many as 800, that water on lakes and rivers around <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> may be in worse shape than the flock at <PERSON> Henry </PERSON>'s Fork. `` In all likelihood, we could lose a fair number of those birds,'' she said. `` That's why it is so important to protect the swans on the <PERSON> Henry </PERSON>'s Fork.'' The cold and high wind grounded the <ORGANIZATION> Idaho </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fish </ORGANIZATION> and Game's plans to transplant bighorn sheep from the <LOCATION> Morgan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Creek </LOCATION> drainage north of <LOCATION> Challis </LOCATION> in central <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> to the <LOCATION> Selway </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> drainage. Officials first attempted to capture sheep on Tuesday, `` but we were blown out of the sky,'' <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Oldenburg </PERSON>, the department's big game supervisor, said Friday. He said it would be rescheduled for the week of Feb. 12. He said two sheep were caught the first day but had to be released once high winds kicked up and made flying difficult. Wind and poor visibility also kept helicopters on the ground Wednesday. On Thursday, temperatures near zero, 10 mph wind and the additional wind chill created by flying combined to create temperatures estimated by <PERSON> Oldenburg </PERSON> at 100 degrees below zero. In addition, he said the net gun used to trap sheep froze and would not fire, and the helicopter had no doors to protect the crew from the cold. The lone ewe caught Thursday was released, but not before nasal, blood and fecal samples were taken and a radio collar was placed on her. <PERSON> Oldennburg </PERSON> said one of the sheep caught Tuesday, a 4-year-old ram, appeared weak and in poor health, but he attributed that to two years of drought and winter hardships rather than pneumonia. The others appeared healthy, he said.

<TEXT>
 A group of Carmelite nuns protesting what they call the liberalization of their order began the fifth month barricaded in their monastery's infirmary Saturday with no apparent sign of coming out. <PERSON> Betty </PERSON> <PERSON> Sutton </PERSON>, a friend who acts as their spokeswoman, says the five women are resigned to wait until the Vatican rules on their dispute with monastery officials. `` They're patient and they're awaiting an answer and they're very hopeful,'' she said in a telephone interview. <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> Manning </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Diocese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Paterson </ORGANIZATION>, said the nuns have given no sign of ending their protest. They are objecting to the introduction of such things as television and candy into the monestery and want it returned to the Carmelites' traditionally austere lifestyle. They also seek permission to remain at the monestery. No word has come from the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION>, and there is no way of knowing when a decision can be expected, <PERSON> Manning </PERSON> said. `` Obviously, it must have been a very trying time for all the nuns, those inside the infirmary and in the monastery,'' he said. There are eight other nuns at the Monastery of the Most Blessed <PERSON> Virgin </PERSON> <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carmel </LOCATION>. The nuns locked themselves in the infirmary Oct. 4, saying they were afraid officials wanted to expel them from the monastery for their dissident views. Since the protest began, vows of one of the five nuns, Sister <PERSON> Bernadette </PERSON>, have expired, and those of another, Sister <PERSON> John </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION>, expire Feb. 19, <PERSON> Manning </PERSON> said. Those two were under temporary, five-year vows while the other three's vows have become permanent. The nuns refuse to recognize the expiration dates, saying everything remains status quo while their case is before the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Manning </PERSON> said the monastery will take no action against the two nuns whose vows have expired or are expiring. `` The hope is that it will soon be resolved,'' he said.

<HEAD>After 13 Years, Mafia Commission Releases Files</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The most exhaustive Mafia study ever done by the Italian government was released Saturday, 13 years after it was completed, news reports said. The 3,852-page study lists the names of 2,405 people and 345 organizations or businesses collected by a special parliamentary commission set up in 1962 to probe the Mafia, according to the <ORGANIZATION> ANSA </ORGANIZATION> news agency and state-run television. The names range from well-known Italian politicians to such fabled Mafiosi as <PERSON> Lucky </PERSON> <PERSON> Luciano </PERSON>, the Italian-American gangster, the <ORGANIZATION> ANSA </ORGANIZATION> report said. `` The files published today do n't refer to people suspected of belonging to the Mafia or having links with it, but instead to every person ... insinuated ... in a situation of this -LRB- Mafia -RRB- type,'' said the introduction written by Sen. <PERSON> Gerardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Chiaromonte </PERSON>, according to <ORGANIZATION> ANSA </ORGANIZATION>. Chiaromonte is head of the current parliamentary anti-Mafia commission. Sources for the names included police, newspaper reports, witnesses who testified before the commission and anonymous tips. The report's release had been expected since Chiaromonte's commission voted in November and again in December to make it public No one answered the telephone in Chiaromonte's office Saturday, and the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> press office was closed. It was not clear whether the report would have much effect, both because of its age and the varying credibility of the sources. <PERSON> Chiaromonte </PERSON> said the commission decided to make the list public in order to dispel any suspicion that `` a public organism wants to hide, in all or in part, news regarding the involvement of politicians in Mafia affairs.'' Links between politicians and the Mafia have been a hot topic since the so-called `` maxi-trial'' ended in December 1987 with 338 people found guilty. The 30-member parliamentary commission issued statements listing the names of some suspected Mafia leaders. But the final report did not give names. The part made public called for trying suspected organized crime figures on tax charges and increasing surveillance of them. Leftist members of the commission, in a minority, had charged that `` powder keg'' revelations were being covered up. But other members of the commission said unsubstantiated charges should not be published. The report released Saturday focuses on Mafia activity from 1963 to the early 1970s. It reportedly includes names of local and national politicians ranging from communists to members of the far-right <ORGANIZATION> Italian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION>. Among those denounced to the commission were several politicians, judges and writers who had taken strong stands against the <ORGANIZATION> Mafia </ORGANIZATION>, suggesting that some people tried to use the investigation to damage their enemies. One senator who accused several politicians of having Mafia ties was himself later charged by an anonymous source with having links to the Mafia.

 Solidarity leaders met Saturday to prepare for historic talks with the government that Prime Minister <PERSON> Mieczyslaw </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rakowski </PERSON> called `` a significant event in the life of <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> and other leaders of the outlawed labor movement are to sit down with government leaders on Monday to begin discussing social and economic reforms considered crucial to this increasingly impoverished nation. The long-awaited negotiations, known as the round-table talks, will take place in <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> and also address the legalization of Solidarity, the first recognized independent union in the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc. `` There was commotion concerning the round table in which I had to take part as chief of government because I was aware of the fact that the round table is a significant event in the life of <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Rakowski </PERSON> said in nationally televised address Saturday night. `` There may be advantages to all of us.'' Government spokesman <PERSON> Jerzy </PERSON> <PERSON> Urban </PERSON> said the opening session would be aired on Polish television, the state-run news agency <ORGANIZATION> PAP </ORGANIZATION> reported. In <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION>, meanwhile, Solidarity's Citizen's <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, which was formed by <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> in December to address social and political problems, met to prepare for the talks. The names of the Solidarity delegates to the talks will be voted on Sunday, said Solidarity spokesman <PERSON> Piotr </PERSON> <PERSON> Konopka </PERSON>. The government proposed the talks during a wave of strikes in August, <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s worst labor unrest since authorities imposed martial law in December 1981. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> refused to agree to talks until the authorities agreed to legalize the unionm which was banned by parliament in 1982. On Jan. 18, in a dramatic reversal of policy, the <ORGANIZATION> communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> said it would be willing to legalize the union if its members agreed to obey the law, refrain from strikes and help reform the economy. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> has said he agreed to bargain with authorities because of the magnitude of <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s problems. The offer has caused deep concern among the rank-and-file communist party leadership, which concluded a three-day ideology conference on Saturday. `` The conference confirmed that Marxism in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> is at a stage of difficult, but bold and unrestrained search,'' Politburo member <PERSON> Marian </PERSON> <PERSON> Orzechowski </PERSON> said, <ORGANIZATION> PAP </ORGANIZATION> reported. <PERSON> Andrzej </PERSON> <PERSON> Czyz </PERSON>, head of the party's ideological department, said the party would advocate political reform and the introduction of greater freedom. `` The primary postulate was to speed the relinquishing of a centrally governed society,'' <PERSON> Czyz </PERSON> said at a news conference.

 Police arrested a rebel leader at a hotel and dealt a strong blow to <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>'s pro-Cuban guerrilla movement, authorities said Saturday. Police said <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Polay </PERSON>, 37, was seized with a female companion late Friday in <LOCATION> Huancayo </LOCATION>, 140 miles east of <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Polay </PERSON>, a former college friend of President <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON>, is considered one of the leaders of the <ORGANIZATION> Tupac </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Amaru </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION>, which favors Cuba-styled Marxism. The group began armed actions against the government in 1984. The seizure of <PERSON> Polay </PERSON>, known as Commander <PERSON> Rolando </PERSON>, is the most important guerrilla arrest since <PERSON> Osman </PERSON> <PERSON> Morote </PERSON>, the reputed No. 2 leader of the <ORGANIZATION> Maoist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shining </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Path </ORGANIZATION> guerrilla band, was captured in June, said police. They spoke on condition of anonymity, citing security reasons. The Tupac Amaru group is smaller and considered much less violent than the <ORGANIZATION> Shining </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Path </ORGANIZATION>, whose nine-year insurgency has claimed more than 12,000 lives. The two groups do not have ties. Dozens of police surrounded the hotel where <PERSON> Polay </PERSON> was staying and arrested him without a struggle. Police refused to say how they knew he was at the hotel. The <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION> newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Expreso </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Polay </PERSON> shouted `` Death to informers!'' as he was led away. The Tupac Amaru guerrillas startled <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION> in November 1987 when <PERSON> Polay </PERSON> led 100 well-armed rebels in a monthlong series of raids near <LOCATION> Tarapoto </LOCATION>, a jungle city 435 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION>. The military quickly dispersed the rebel column. The government never fully disclosed details of the clashes, but analysts said the rebel band was seriously hurt. Its armed actions since have been rare. In the 1960s, <PERSON> Polay </PERSON> was a student leader of the governing center-left <ORGANIZATION> Aprista </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. He reportedly studied with <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> in the early 1970s.

 Iranian authorities have carried out summary executions, arbitrary arrests, and torture on a troubling scale despite the cease-fire in the war with <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, a new <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> report says. The study for the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> said a wave of executions in 1988, especially after an invasion by anti-government forces based in <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, halted a two-year decrease in the number of executions. It said the scale of recent abuse in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> `` justifies international concern.'' The 42-page report, released Friday, lists 1,096 names of people alleged to have been executed between late July and mid-December. `` But it was alleged that there were in all probability several thousand victims,'' said the report. The U.N.-mediated cease-fire in the eight-year war took effect Aug. 20. `` Arrests are apparently so numerous that some high officials have requested the authorities to act with more moderation,'' said the report. It said detention of relatives of people accused of political crimes `` appears to be a common practice.'' The study also pointed to continuing reports of ill-treatment and torture of prisoners. `` Investigation, trial and serving of sentence are reportedly effected under duress, hardships and different kinds of torture,'' it said. The report, which was done from outside <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, collected information from witnesses and reports in Iranian and foreign media.

 House Democrats tried with little success on Saturday to temporarily put aside the firestorm over a proposed 51 percent congressional pay raise and focus instead on broader national issues. While an inspirational speech by <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> and the pampering and recreation of the <LOCATION> Greenbrier </LOCATION> resort helped soothe frayed nerves, the lawmakers remained anxious for a way to put the pay issue permanently behind them. Former President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s proposal to raise federal pay for members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, federal judges and top executive branch employees takes effect Wednesday unless both the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> vote to kill it. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> has already done so, making <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Democrats the center of the controversy because Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, plans to let it take effect. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said he would hold a subsequent vote to reduce the raise to 30 percent, but rank-and-file Democrats continued to voice skepticism that such a plan would quell public outcry. Rep. <PERSON> Steny </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoyer </PERSON>, D-Md., a member of the Democratic leadership supporting's <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s approach, acknowledged that many House members were willing to give up any pay raise even though they believed they needed to earn more than the current salary of $ 89,500 `` I think they're frustrated with trying to answer to an angry public and an insatiable press,'' said <PERSON> Hoyer </PERSON>. `` At some point, people get tired of being looked upon as thieves and greedy folks. I think everybody's getting a little testy _ like me.'' Rep. <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, D-Mont., offered one of the most graphic descriptions yet of the controversy `` It's like living with a political gas leak, only it's not odorless or colorless,'' he said. `` And the voters are going to strike the match.'' Many of the approximately 150 Democrats spent Saturday morning listening to panel discussions on issues facing the country, including the deficit and social economic inequities. Then <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON>, delivering the keynote speech at a luncheon, told them that <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> should take heart because President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s statements that more needed to be done for the homeless and needy was an embracing of Democratic values and `` a giant step forward to the truth and progress.'' `` He has clearly said that the Democrats were right ... by candidly rejecting his predecessor's narrow view of life in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> said. If <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> fails to push forward his `` kinder and gentler'' programs, he will `` have earned himself some cheap grace by reciting some Democratic poetry,'' he said. In such an event, he said, Democrats should push their agenda even if that eventually means seeking to raise taxes to cover the cost. `` When you present him with the solutions, would it not be difficult for the president then to say no?'' he asked. <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> made no direct mention of the pay raise controversy, but kidded the lawmakers that their annual retreat to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> to get away from daily pressures was `` a great idea ... when it works.'' Several dozen news people were watching the conference but the resort otherwise coddled and protected the Democrats. A small band of anti-pay-raise demonstrators was kept outside the front gates, seen only by those lawmakers who cruised by in resort limousines on their way to the skeet and trap-shooting range. The hotel switchboard screened callers, asking whether they were calling about the pay raise. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, at the center of the controversy, kept mostly to himself except for introducing <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> at the luncheon. Protected by staff, he did n't talk to reporters about the pay raise but praised <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON>'s speech as a challenge to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who addresses a joint meeting of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> Thursday night `` We'll now see whether it's words or whether it's deeds,'' he said. `` Words are fine. They set a good tone. But now it's time for deeds.'' Rep. <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Ackerman </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, who is <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON>'s congressman, praised the speech as `` what we came to hear.'' `` He's the only constituent I've seen in two weeks who did n't ask about the pay raise,'' he said.

 <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON>, who made their mark selling premium Vermont-made ice cream, are trying their hand at marketing worldwide peace in hopes it will be as popular someday as their <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Super Fudge Crunch. <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenfield </PERSON>, co-founders of <ORGANIZATION> Ben </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Homemade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, are in the seventh month of their `` 1 Percent For Peace'' campaign, an effort to have 1 percent of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military budget devoted to promoting peace `` Certainly taking 1 percent of the military budget is not going to leave us open to attack,'' <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> said. `` It's just saying, let's redirect a small portion of it, and I think people can understand that. One percent of the military budget amounts to $ 3 billion, <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> said. `` If you put $ 3 billion in the bank, the interest alone would be $ 750,000 a day,'' he said. The ice-cream makers would like to see the money spent on things like exchanges between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, conversion of weapons factories to power plants, or a multinational youth corps for problems like homelessness and hunger. They are financing the lobbying effort with 1 percent of the profits from the Peace Pop, a chocolate-covered ice cream bar on a stick that sells for $ 1.75. One percent of the profits comes to about $ 50,000 a year. They expect it will take five to 10 years for the idea to reach the people who can make it work. `` I think of this as a product, the same as we've been in the business of marketing ice cream. So the beginning's fairly slow,'' <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> said. `` We're at the very beginning, and actually, I'm incredibly excited at how fast it's going. <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> & amp; <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON>'s, which generates annual sales of $ 32 million, began 11 years ago in a renovated <LOCATION> Burlington </LOCATION> gas station. The 1 Percent For Peace project began just as inauspiciously when <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> discussed the concept with a friend of a friend in <LOCATION> Ithaca </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>. An office was set up in <LOCATION> Ithaca </LOCATION>, at the <ORGANIZATION> Ben </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Jerry </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>, a company group that distributes about $ 250,000 a year to charitable causes The push for peace was officially launched in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> in August and again at the <LOCATION> Newport </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> R.I. </LOCATION>, Folk Festival. While <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Cray </PERSON> and <PERSON> Taj </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahal </PERSON> entertained the crowd, <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> and <PERSON> Greenfield </PERSON> manned a booth and collected signatures on petitions, sold T-shirts with the 1 percent logo and promoted the concept to passers-by. So far, the campaign has attracted interest from roughly 40 businesses. They include a restaurant in <LOCATION> Ithaca </LOCATION>, a children's musical recording company in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and a construction company in <LOCATION> Woodstock </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> Schwartzbach </PERSON>, executive director of the 1 Percent organization `` The idea here is to try to get as many businesses as possible to use this logo,'' <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> said. The organization's goal for 1989 is to interest another 320 companies in the concept. They, in turn, will spread the word an estimated 161.5 million times, either through brochures, bumper stickers, logos on their products or similar means. `` I do n't believe that the world can not change,'' <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> said. `` And if the world is going to change we have to take positive steps _ we as citizens _ to change it.''

 Right-wing radicals claim they are winning the allegiance of more mainstream Germans after capturing 11 seats in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> legislature. `` The <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> elections show that a psychological barrier has been removed,'' said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Kuehnen </PERSON>, the leader of a Nazi-oriented group and a prominent right-wing extremist. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> has been involved in some deep soul-searching ever since Jan. 29, when the far-right <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> won 11 seats in the 138-seat legislature and 7.5 percent of the vote. With their showing, the Republicans also won the right to send two representatives to the federal Bundestag next year. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> is considered a state under the West German system, but its representatives to the national parliament have limited powers. Though a sweeping rightist trend seems virtually impossible in modern <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, a Jewish leader called the elections `` a warning shot.'' `` I fear the Republicans have hit upon a mood that's not just in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>,'' said <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> Jewish Community spokesman <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Friedman </PERSON>. He said the strong showing by the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> will make the extreme right `` socially acceptable'' to many West Germans. The Republicans campaigned on a platform that included a call to oust foreign workers from the city. Their positions won broader support than pollsters predicted, reflecting the volatile and growing nationalist sentiments stirred by housing and job shortages that are especially acute in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>. The big, established parties _ the conservative <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> _ won most of the rest of the seats in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> legislature. The outcome of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> elections also mobilized activists. An estimated 10,000 people marched through downtown <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> on Saturday to protest the right-wing groups. `` Foreigners stay, <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION> away,'' shouted demonstrators, who marched peacefully. Also Saturday, about 200 right-wing supporters of the Free German Workers Party marched in the northern city of <LOCATION> Rotenburg </LOCATION>, drawing a counter-demonstration by 1,200 opponents. Four hundred police officers stood by, and one minor injury was reported from a thrown rock. In <LOCATION> Munich </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Franz </PERSON> <PERSON> Schoenhuber </PERSON> said his members would not yield to the `` terror'' of demonstrators. `` On the contrary, it makes us as a law-and-order party stronger and stronger,'' the 66-year-old former <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> SS soldier told reporters last week. Both the mainstream right and left have warned that more Republican successes are possible. `` The danger is certainly there, since they're conducting their campaign with <PERSON> Pied </PERSON> <PERSON> Piper </PERSON> techniques,'' said Gov. <PERSON> Lothar </PERSON> <PERSON> Spaeth </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Baden-Wuerttemberg </LOCATION>, a Christian Democrat. Some West Germans point to other troubling signs: _ The Republicans are expected to field candidates in some of the municipal elections this year in five more states _ Right-wing extremists already are making elaborate plans to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the birth of <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON> on April 20 The number of extreme rightists is estimated at about 28,300 by the federal <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>. _ A flood of asylum-seekers, numbering 103,076 last year alone, has been angering some people in towns and cities across <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> Some West Germans say the foreigners contribute to high unemployment and housing shortages. Since the <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> elections, a campaign by an openly Nazi-oriented group in the town of <LOCATION> Langen </LOCATION> outside <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> has been receiving attention nationwide. The campaign leader is <PERSON> Kuehnen </PERSON>, who was released from prison in March 1988 after a 3 -LCB- - year sentence for pro-Nazi activities `` As individuals we are Nazis,'' said the 33-year-old <PERSON> Kuehnen </PERSON> during an AP interview. He wore a brown shirt and was accompanied by a bodyguard carrying what was described as a tear-gas pistol. <PERSON> Kuehnen </PERSON> repeatedly insisted his group is not a Nazi organization, which are banned by West German law. `` We are proud of the past. We are proud to be Germans,'' <PERSON> Kuehnen </PERSON> said. `` We want to break taboos. For example, we plan to present a motion to rename the railroad station square ` Adolf Hitler Square.'''

<HEAD>West Germany, Amid Libyan Scandal, Restates Support For Chemical
Weapons Ban</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The government, facing allegations it allowed exports that helped <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> develop poison gas, said Saturday it wants this week's <ORGANIZATION> Geneva </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> on Disarmament to ban chemical weapons. The 40-nation conference begins Tuesday in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>. `` The federal government hopes that the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> negotiations lead to a worldwide, comprehensive and unqualified ban on the development and production, possession, acquisition, proliferation and use of chemical weapons,'' said government spokesman <PERSON> Friedhelm </PERSON> <PERSON> Ost </PERSON>. The meeting's secretary-general, <PERSON> Milan </PERSON> <PERSON> Komatina </PERSON>, told reporters in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> that <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> have asked to join in the conference and that he does not expect objections from the participants. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> says <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> has built a chemical weapons plant in the desert city of <LOCATION> Rabta </LOCATION> with the help of West German firms. <PERSON> Komatina </PERSON>, a Yugoslav, spoke Friday at end of a two-week closed-door session of the <ORGANIZATION> Disarmament </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION>'s special working group that is preparing a treaty that would ban chemical weapons. He said there is a positive climate for the talks because of <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>'s decision to drop its proposal that each country be allowed to hold limited `` security stocks'' during the 10-year treaty period when chemical weapons should be destroyed. <PERSON> Ost </PERSON> said <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> sought a chemical weapons ban since 1954 and nearly three years ago asked the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to remove its chemical weapons from the country no later than 1992. But <PERSON> Ost </PERSON> made no mention in his statement of an escalating controversy over West German firms' shipments of equipment to <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> that were apparently used to produce chemical weapons. On Friday, the <ORGANIZATION> Degussa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> AG </ORGANIZATION> company of <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> confirmed a report that German customs officials halted a Libya-bound shipment of its chemicals to determine if they could be used to produce explosives or poison gas. The Nordsee Zeitung newspaper in the port city of <LOCATION> Bremerhaven </LOCATION> reported Friday that customs officials refused to authorize loading of 17 containers of the chemical hexamethylene tetramine for shipment by the <ORGANIZATION> Degussa </ORGANIZATION> company to <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>. The crystalline compound is used in the vulcanization of rubber, in medicine, explosives and other products. The company also acknowledged it sent chemicals to <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> since 1983 for use in making fertilizer and not explosives or poison gas. Investigations are under way into the export activities of a number of West German companies, primarily Imhausen-Chemie of <PERSON> Lahr </PERSON>, but the probes have to date produced no charges or arrests in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Chrysler Donates Several Buildings To Kenosha, To Demolish Others</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KENOSHA, Wis. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> has donated several abandoned buildings to the community before tearing down most of its former car assembly plant here, officials said. The company, whose auto assembly lines in <LOCATION> Kenosha </LOCATION> were closed in December, announced Friday that some structures would remain for use by the city, county and <ORGANIZATION> Gateway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Collins </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Kenosha </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> executive administrator, said <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> wanted to raze all the main plant buildings except for an engine factory and stamping operation, but local officials persuaded it to donate some buildings. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Dauch </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION>'s vice president of manufacturing, said the donations represent about 550,000 square feet of office and factory space in four buildings. In addition, some land near a municipal golf course will be deeded to the city of 80,000 residents, he said. The plant's main office building will be donated to <LOCATION> Kenosha </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> for its <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, officials said. <PERSON> Collins </PERSON> said officials plan to move the <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> Job Service into the building to create a central location for former <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> workers seeking welfare and job-hunting help. <PERSON> Dauch </PERSON> said a factory building will be turned over to <ORGANIZATION> Gateway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tech </ORGANIZATION> for a business incubator center. A nearby building will be donated for the school's administrative offices. <ORGANIZATION> Kenosha </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Area </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> will move into a fourth building. <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> obtained the factory complex as part of its 1987 purchase of <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. The complex had been used for automaking for 86 years. Chrysler announced in January 1988 that it would shut down most of the plant, citing its age and inefficiency. <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> officials threatened to sue <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION>, saying the automaker had promised verbally to keep the plant open through 1992 in exchange for $ 5 million in state job training funds. <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> reached an out-of-court settlement that included $ 250 million in aid to workers, the community of nearly 80,000 residents and the state. About 4,500 jobs were lost last year when <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> closed the factory except for engine production. The company's 1.8-million-square-feet engine plant, which employs 1,350 workers, will remain in operation, <PERSON> Dauch </PERSON> said. The company also will retain ownership of several parking lots and a shipping yard, he said.

<HEAD>Fourth Game In Timman-Portisch Match Adjourned</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The fourth game in the World Chess Championship Candidates quarterfinal between <LOCATION> Holland </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Timman </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Lajos </PERSON> <PERSON> Portisch </PERSON> was adjourned after 62 moves Saturday. The bishops and pawns left on the board after six hours of play might still hide some surprises but experts felt a draw would be the most likely outcome. Dutch grandmaster <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> van </PERSON> <PERSON> der </PERSON> <PERSON> Wiel </PERSON>, who visited the tournament hall in the basement of an <LOCATION> Antwerp </LOCATION> luxury hotel to see his countryman in action, even said he expected the two opponents would sign the draw without further play. `` Of course, <PERSON> Timman </PERSON> will analyze the position thoroughly with his seconds overnight, but I for one do n't see how he could possibly avoid splitting the point with <LOCATION> Portisch </LOCATION> in this one,'' <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> der </PERSON> <PERSON> Wiel </PERSON> said. A draw would be a serious setback for the 37-year-old <PERSON> Timman </PERSON>, who played white in Saturday's game and desperately needed a victory to catch up with his 51-year-old Hungarian opponent. <PERSON> Portisch </PERSON> won the third encounter the day before and was leading 2-1 with only two more games to go in the six-game match, one of a series of knock-out contests to select a challenger who will play world champion <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Kasparov </PERSON> for his title in 1990. <PERSON> Timman </PERSON> started the game well, following a line from the <PERSON> Ruy </PERSON> <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON> to build up a better position and concentrating his forces on the queenside, where he seemed set to launch a strong offensive. At the decisive moment, however, he hesitated, playing a number of careful moves, when he might have pressed his advantage and start an all-out offensive. <PERSON> Portisch </PERSON> reacted immediately, exchanging queens and, after some tactical complications, getting the rooks off the board as well. Even <PERSON> Timman </PERSON>'s West German second, <PERSON> Vlastimil </PERSON> <PERSON> Hort </PERSON>, admitted the Hungarian was `` playing a fine defending game'' at that stage. `` Portisch kept a cool head'', he said. `` Jan's attack seemed decisive, but maybe <PERSON> Portisch </PERSON> had calculated farther and decided he could take the risk.'' `` Jan was probably right in not going all out. In fact, I think it's a miracle the way he is playing, especially after the defeat he suffered yesterday. Most players would not even try. They would settle for a draw the day after they lost a game,'' <PERSON> Hort </PERSON> said. Public attention for the duel was overwhelming at first, with about one hundred spectators watching in the silence of the tournament hall, while another two hundred thronged the auditorium next door, where two Belgian masters, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Meulders </PERSON> and <PERSON> Luc </PERSON> <PERSON> Winants </PERSON>, were commenting on the game _ Meulders in Flemish and <PERSON> Winants </PERSON> in French. But after <PERSON> Portisch </PERSON> had succeeded in maintaining the balance and the game developed into an ever more drawish position, most people went home until only a handful were left to see <PERSON> Portisch </PERSON> seal his move at the 62nd. The resumption is to be played on Sunday with the fifth game following on Monday.

 British and French diplomats left <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> on Saturday after their nations closed their embassies, joining an exodus of Western countries as the last Soviet soldiers pull out of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s 19 embassy staff members and the four <ORGANIZATION> French </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> workers flew aboard a chartered plane to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION> and arrived there Saturday evening. Their departure from <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> was delayed a day because of a storm. A convoy of about 40 Soviet military vehicles rolled out of the snowy capital about 3 a.m., headed toward the border. On Friday, a huge column of tanks, armored personnel carriers and trucks slipped out under cover of darkness and headed up the <LOCATION> Salang </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Highway </LOCATION>, the only route between <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> and the Soviet border. The deputy foreign minister of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Yuli </PERSON> <PERSON> Vorontsov </PERSON>, was quoted as saying the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> will be out of the country well ahead of the Feb. 15 deadline set by a U.N.-mediated accord. `` Within four days, there will be no Soviet forces in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Vorontsov </PERSON> was quoted as saying by <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s official <ORGANIZATION> Tehran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> during a visit to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. The radio said <PERSON> Vorontsov </PERSON> would discuss with Iranian officials and <LOCATION> Afghan </LOCATION> resistance leaders the future of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> after the Soviets leave. Soviet Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> arrived in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> on the same mission early Sunday and was expected to propose a political settlement. `` The Soviet leadership has decided to consult with the government of <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> on how best to contribute to restoring peace and tranquility in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> told reporters before a scheduled day of talks with Pakistani officials who support the guerrillas. But he added, `` Problems have been piling up. There are quite a few of them.'' Pakistani Defense Minister <PERSON> Ghulam </PERSON> <PERSON> Sarwar </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheema </PERSON> said Saturday in the <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> capital of <LOCATION> Riyadh </LOCATION> that his government has formed a committee to oversee resettlement of the 3 million Afghan refugees living in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>. `` The process of shifting Afghan refugees from <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> to their homeland will be handled smoothly after complete evacuation of the Soviet forces from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Cheema </PERSON>, on a state visit to <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>. Guerrilla leaders, meanwhile, warned they might launch a major attack on the strategic city of <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION>, about 90 miles east of <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Abdul </PERSON> <PERSON> Zaher </PERSON>, a senior commander of the <ORGANIZATION> Jamiat-i-Islami </ORGANIZATION> guerrilla group, said the insurgents did not want to attack the crowded city for fear of injuring civilians but that they might if communist forces there do n't give up soon. <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION> could be the first major Afghan city to fall to the guerrillas, local insurgent commanders said. They said its fall would weaken the defense of <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> and open up the highway to the capital. In and around <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>, Afghan solders patrol the streets and outdoor markets. The armored personnel carriers once stationed in the crowded bazaars are gone. Western countries began pulling their diplomats from <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> late last month because of fears for their safety once the Soviets are gone and Afghan troops are left to battle Moslem guerrillas alone. The Soviets intervened in December 1979 to back Afghan troops in their war with the Moslem guerrillas. They began pulling their estimated 100,000 soldiers out in May, in accordance with the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> accord. Soviet and Afghan officials have estimated there are about 1,000 Soviet soldiers still in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, including a small contingent assigned to <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> airport. Giant Ilyushin-76 transport planes have been flying into <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> ferrying supplies of flour and other goods in short supply. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> quietly shut its embassy early Saturday. `` We did n't want a public display,'' said one diplomat, referring to the highly publicized flag-lowering ceremony when the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Embassy closed. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s highest-ranking diplomat in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Ian </PERSON> <PERSON> Mackley </PERSON>, said he looked forward to returning home. <PERSON> Mackley </PERSON> was married Jan. 21 in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and returned to <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> on Jan. 22. `` I postponed my honeymoon to come here. I hope to resume it fairly soon,'' he said. The French charge d'affaires, <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Petit </PERSON>, saw his staff off at the airport. He said he plans to leave <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> on Monday and was staying over to `` lock the doors.'' <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> also have closed their embassies, and some eastern European and <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> countries are reducing their staff. President <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> denounced the moves Thursday as `` psychological warfare ... trying to create panic and embarrass and confuse public opinion.'' He said diplomats would be safe in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> after Feb. 15.

 Attorney General <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> said Saturday he has told regulators with the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> `` in no uncertain terms'' that they lack authority to promise immunity from prosecution to savings and loan officials. `` Henceforth it's not to be indulged in,'' <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> said. The attorney general said he believed there were only `` isolated instances'' in which bank board regulators offered immunity from prosecution to those under investigation for fraud in the savings and loan industry. <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON>, in an impromptu news conference following a luncheon speech at the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> convention here, declined to be drawn into a possible controversy over gun control. <ORGANIZATION> ABA </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Raven </PERSON> said Friday he asked <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> to support a federal waiting period for would-be gun buyers. <PERSON> Raven </PERSON>, citing the recent slaying of five children at a <LOCATION> Stockton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, school and the wounding of four others in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, said there is a `` glaring loophole'' in federal law that allows people to buy automatic weapons and assault rifles. <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> refused to say if he supports <PERSON> Raven </PERSON>'s waiting period proposal or if such weapons are too easily purchased. `` We want to look at it,'' the attorney general said. The savings and loan questions were prompted by a reports that federal prosecutors are being hamstrung by promises of immunity made by <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> regulators. A <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> said top officials of the failed <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marino </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> were told they could avoid prosecution by helping regulators recover some of the money lost when the thrift institution collapsed in 1984. <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> said the offer was a misunderstanding made without consultation with the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and that bank board regulators have been warned not to do it again. <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> also met with the <ORGANIZATION> ABA </ORGANIZATION> group that assesses judicial appointees and said he thinks it will continue to play a role in evaluating <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration nominees to the federal bench. In his remarks to the <ORGANIZATION> ABA </ORGANIZATION> luncheon, <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> said the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration will be a tough fighter against street crime. `` Firm and effective action against drug-related criminal activities, including application of the newly enacted federal death penalty, will be necessary to end the free-fire zones that have taken the lives of so many innocent people,'' he said. <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> also said he supports a pay raise of about 50 percent for federal judges that is due to take effect unless both houses of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> vote to block it before Wednesday. `` It's absolutely essential that the pay-raise bill take effect,'' he said. <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> also said he will press for higher pay for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorneys and <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>, which has been trying for decades to get into the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> to investigate human rights abuses, has been invited for a visit, a newspaper reported Saturday. Officials of the London-based human rights organization were not available to confirm the report in the Guardian. The paper said the group had written to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> to discuss the timing of the visit and the range of people and institutions with whom contacts would be sought. <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> has been seeking an invitation to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> since 1960, when the organization was established, the Guardian said. In December, Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> declared his government no longer held political prisoners, and Western observers generally acknowledge a dramatic drop in the number of political prisoners since <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> rose to power. <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> said in October that it had information on 150 Soviets `` imprisoned solely for the non-violent exercise of their fundamental human rights.'' The human rights group said its list included about 30 religious believers, 30 conscientious objectors to military service and about 20 people held against their will for indefinite periods in psychiatric hospitals. It also said it had information that since February 1987, 314 political prisoners had been released in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, `` 249 of whom we knew or suspected to have been prisoners of conscience.''

 The first feverish day of <ORGANIZATION> Carnival </ORGANIZATION> exploded Saturday with thousands of revelers jamming costume balls, bars and samba parades to indulge in four days of drinking, dancing and sexual abandon. All over <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s largest country _ from humid <LOCATION> Amazon </LOCATION> cities to the concrete urban center of <LOCATION> Sao </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paulo </LOCATION> _ merrymakers traded their everyday clothes for sequin and feather-clad costumes and shook and shimmied to samba strains in private clubs or in the streets. By midnight Friday, nightclubs and hotel ballrooms were jammed throughout <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION>, the hub of <ORGANIZATION> Carnival </ORGANIZATION>, as liquor flowed and sweat-slicked, scantily clad bodies gyrated and swung to the rhythmic sounds of pulsing samba bands in the warm summer night. Streets and private clubs decorated with streamers and flashing bulbs awaited the crush of thousands of Brazilians and tourists. Banks, stores and government offices shut down for the four-day frenzy and were to reopen on Ash Wednesday, when Carnival officially ends. In <LOCATION> Recife </LOCATION>, about 1,536 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION>, lavishly decorated trucks pumping highly amplified samba music from their loudspeakers inched down dancer-packed avenues. Meanwhile, in the coastal cities of <LOCATION> Fortaleza </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, sunbathers packed beaches and revelers went wild dancing `` the crocodile,'' hopping back and forth along boulevards behind throbbing samba bands and music trucks that headed parade processions. But spirits were hardly high in <PERSON> Belo </PERSON> <PERSON> Horizonte </PERSON>, the nation's third-largest city about 288 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> After the municipal government canceled the city's main Carnival festivities because of a lack of funds, thousands packed bus stations and airports to enjoy the festival in other cities. In <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION>, however, little seemed able to dampen <ORGANIZATION> Carnival </ORGANIZATION> euphoria _ not last year's record 1,000 percent inflation, nor charges of corruption and nepotism in the government, nor the closing of schools and hospitals because city employees had n't received their December paychecks. Not even heavy showers Friday and Saturday seemed to deaden the city's festive spirit. After the official opening ceremonies Saturday, in which jolly and fat King <PERSON> Momo </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Carnival </ORGANIZATION>'s symbolic sovereign, received the keys to the city from Mayor <PERSON> Marcello </PERSON> <PERSON> Alencar </PERSON>, crowds of thousands accompanied by bands and parades started singing and dancing down the streets of downtown <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION>. Poorer Brazilians banged out rhythms on pots and pans and frolicked in the falling rain, while the city's well-heeled donned glittering beaded costumes and danced the samba all night in luxurious ballrooms. On Friday night at the <ORGANIZATION> Sugar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loaf </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ball </ORGANIZATION>, the first of a number of ornate, celebrity-studded balls at the base of <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION>'s famed <LOCATION> Sugar </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Loaf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountain </LOCATION>, the crowd went wild dancing beneath statues of <PERSON> Marilyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Monroe </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lenin </PERSON>. And at <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION>'s famed Scala nightclub, the site of some of the rowdiest Carnival balls, party-goers ate and drank from a stock of 1 ton of filet mignon, 650 pounds of shrimp, 210 cases of scotch and 2,600 gallons of draft beer. Behind the merrymaking, authorities are concerned about uncontrolled sex and a sharp increase of AIDS cases. <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>, with about 4,946 registered cases since 1980, is third in the world in the number of AIDS cases after the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>. But as in the past, the undisputed highlight of this year's Carnival will be <PERSON> Rio </PERSON>'s `` samba school'' parade, held in two 15-hour sessions, on Sunday and Monday nights The 18 `` schools,'' neighborhood clubs formed in poor slum areas, will parade as many as 5,000 dancers dressed in flashy feathered costumes and string bikinis down the city's brightly lit `` sambadrome,'' a series of towering concrete grandstands.

 A <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official who visited <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> in his hospital room said Saturday the former <LOCATION> Philippine </LOCATION> president appears to be `` gravely ill.'' `` It's fair to say that the reports previously in the news media that he was in critical condition are absolutely true,'' said <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Craig </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Immigration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Naturalization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> district director based in <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION> <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> is the first <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official to acknowledge seeing <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> since his latest hospitalization. Previous reports on <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' condition were released by <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' doctors or spokesmen <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> remained listed in critical but stable condition Saturday in <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Francis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>'s intensive care unit, said nursing supervisor <PERSON> Ellen </PERSON> <PERSON> Cottingham </PERSON>. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>, admitted to the hospital Jan. 15, underwent a tracheotomy Wednesday to drain fluids from his lungs and has been breathing through a respirator since then. He was hospitalized twice in December for congestive heart failure. <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> met with reporters Saturday after leaving the hospital. He said he did not see <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> on Saturday but did see the ailing 71-year-old exiled leader in his hospital bed Friday. He also said he met with <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' doctors. `` From what I can ascertain he is certainly gravely ill and I have been advised he will not be leaving the hospital for quite some time,'' <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> said <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> did n't recognize him, adding, `` I just do n't think he could recognize anybody, really. He said he went to the hospital in an official capacity, but declined to say whether he had been ordered by his superiors to visit <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>. `` He is a parolee in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> under my jurisdiction and I have to do what I feel is required,'' <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> announced in November it was conducting an inquiry into a dinner honoring several of its officials, including <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> and Western Regional Commissioner <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Ezell </PERSON>, at <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' home overlooking <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION>. The dinner was held last Aug. 3. Philippine Vice President <PERSON> Salvador </PERSON> <PERSON> Laurel </PERSON> visited <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> Thursday and said he came away convinced that <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> was near death and should be allowed to spend his last days in his homeland. <PERSON> Laurel </PERSON> said <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> had a fever of 103 and weighed less than 100 pounds. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' attorneys have maintained that the former leader is too ill to face trial on federal racketeering charges. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Imelda </PERSON>, are under <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> indictment for allegedly plundering the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> of more than $ 100 million and stashing much of the money in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. A federal judge in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> is to decide this month whether <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> is healthy enough to stand trial. Mrs. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> has pleaded innocent and is free on $ 5 million bail. The Marcoses have lived in <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> since fleeing the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> during a civilian-military revolt nearly three years ago.

<TEXT>
 The first <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> production of `` Follies,'' <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Sondheim </PERSON>'s 1971 musical, came to a gala finish Saturday after a 19-month run that won extensive critical acclaim but made no money. `` You are seeing the last night of my dream to bring `` Follies'' to <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>,'' producer <PERSON> Cameron </PERSON> <PERSON> Mackintosh </PERSON> told the audience at the conclusion of a performance marked by nostalgia, affection and repeated ovations. <PERSON> Mackintosh </PERSON> gave special thanks to <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> director <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Prince </PERSON> `` for putting it on in the first place.'' His remarks ended a 10-minute standing ovation that also brought onto the stage composer-lyricist <PERSON> Sondheim </PERSON> and the musical's choreographer <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Avian </PERSON>, both of whom had flown in from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> for the evening The musical at the Shaftesbury Theater told the story of two former Follies showgirls and the stage-door Johnnies they married, all of whom reconvene at a party in 1970 inside a Broadway theater earmarked for demolition. At its July 21, 1987, bow, the <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> production starred <PERSON> Julia </PERSON> <PERSON> McKenzie </PERSON>, <PERSON> Diana </PERSON> <PERSON> Rigg </PERSON>, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Healy </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Massey </PERSON>, with veteran <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> performer <PERSON> Dolores </PERSON> <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> in the supporting role of <LOCATION> Carlotta </LOCATION>, who sings the showstopper, `` I'm Still Here.'' Directed by <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Ockrent </PERSON> -LRB- `` Me and My Girl'' -RRB- and produced by <PERSON> Cameron </PERSON> <PERSON> Mackintosh </PERSON>, the musical boasted four new songs by <PERSON> Sondheim </PERSON> and a somewhat more upbeat finish from the original, which ended with one character having a nervous breakdown. The new `` Follies'' was chosen Best Musical of 1987 at all three of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s theater awards ceremonies. Three of the five principals stayed with the show throughout its run. In July, <PERSON> Millicent </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> replaced <PERSON> Diana </PERSON> <PERSON> Rigg </PERSON> and <PERSON> Eartha </PERSON> <PERSON> Kitt </PERSON> took over from <PERSON> Dolores </PERSON> <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> in a casting coup that has led to <PERSON> Kitt </PERSON>'s upcoming concert show at the same theater, starting March 13 One commentator, <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON> in The <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telegraph </ORGANIZATION>, used the closing of `` Follies'' to strike out Saturday at what he called <PERSON> Sondheim </PERSON>'s `` inflated reputation.'' `` With <PERSON> Sondheim </PERSON>, we get all the glitter and glamor and still remain aloof,'' wrote <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON> in an article entitled `` The trouble with <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Sondheim </PERSON>.'' He said that `` In 13 musicals, only two songs stand out as being beautiful and original.'' Budgeted at $ 2.8 million, `` Follies'' repaid 60 percent of its investment and was never the sellout smash of such other Mackintosh-produced musicals as `` Les Miserables'' and `` The Phantom of the Opera.'' Despite winning seven Tony Awards, the original Broadway engagement failed to recoup its investment which, at $ 800,000, was hefty at the time. Present hopes are for a recast American production of `` Follies'' to start a national tour in the fall. No actors have been signed, although <PERSON> Julie </PERSON> <PERSON> Andrews </PERSON> and <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Cook </PERSON> have been touted for the two leading roles.

<TEXT>
 The army will reopen an investigation into the massacre of 10 peasants, this time with a panel that will not include the commander of the brigade accused of the killings, officials said Saturday. Col. <PERSON> Emilio </PERSON> <PERSON> Chavez </PERSON> <PERSON> Caceres </PERSON>, commander of the <ORGANIZATION> 5th </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> brigade in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vicente </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Province </LOCATION>, played a key role in the initial investigation that absolved his soldiers of responsibility in the killings last year. The decision to reopen the investigation followed a Friday meeting between the high command and visiting Vice President <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, who said the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration is concerned about an upswing in political violence in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, said a military officer, who commented on condition of anonymity. A senior <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official who attended meetings during <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s visit said the vice president hinted that if human rights conditions are not improved, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> may withhold some of the $ 400 million in aid to the country `` What does he have to say? No convictions -LRB- of implicated officers -RRB-, no money? That's too blunt. But there was no question he was talking about aid,'' said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, a tiny country of 5.5 million people, has received more than $ 3.5 billion in economic and military aid this decade _ more than any country in the <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hemisphere </LOCATION>. The aid is part of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> effort to help the government combat a 9-year-old leftist insurgency. The army officer said the new investigation would be conducted by a panel of high-ranking military officers. `` Rather than presuming innocence, the investigators will presume guilt and those implicated will have to show they did not commit the abuses,'' he said. On Sept. 21, soldiers of the 5th brigade's <ORGANIZATION> Jiboa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Battalion </ORGANIZATION> rounded up the residents of the hamlet of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, 27 miles east of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> and accused them of collaborating with rebels. Seven men and three women were marched away and shots were heard in the distance, according to witnesses. Forensic examinations showed the 10 were killed by point-blank shots to the head. The army first claimed the ten were guerrillas killed in combat but later said guerrillas attacked while the 10 were being marched away. This version of the incident was upheld by the investigation in which the soldiers' brigade commander took part.

 Rail traffic resumed Saturday through the site of a train collision and explosion, but nearby residents found repairing damage to their homes difficult with the high temperature reaching only minus 18. A spokeswoman for <ORGANIZATION> Montana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rail </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Link </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> said workers had cleared portions of the wreckage and reopened one of the two tracks. The explosion Thursday morning of a railroad car containing hydrogen peroxide shattered windows up to two miles away and hurled debris hundreds of yards. Thousands of homes were without power for several hours after the crash. Twenty-one runaway freight cars derailed in the collision with three locomotives. About 2,000 people were evacuated from a square-mile area around the blast as thick black smoke poured from a railroad car containing plastics that ignited. The evacuation order was lifted Thursday night, and many residents returned home to find broken windows, frozen pipes and flooded basements. Officials of nearby <ORGANIZATION> Carroll </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>, whose buildings were damaged by flying debris, asked residents to house about 200 students temporarily. One dormitory will be closed for at least a month, and classes wo n't resume until Feb. 13. Some families took refuge with friends or at local motels over the weekend as they waited for repairs by plumbers, glaziers and furnace-repair people, who said they were swamped with business. One plumber began turning away customers Thursday night, while a second reported a waiting list of at least 15 customers by Friday. <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON> <PERSON> Prinzing </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Montana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rail </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Link </ORGANIZATION>'s personnel manager, said the short-line railroad was recording names of claimants and planned to work directly with insurance companies to settle the claims. One resident whose home was damaged said the railroad company should immediately settle the claims. `` I'm going to have to come up with money, cash, for sleeping in my own bed,'' said <PERSON> Wilbur </PERSON> <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON>. `` That's just not fair.'' <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> said several windows were shattered at his house, including one in a solar greenhouse. Several citrus trees in the greenhouse died, he said. About a dozen federal officials are investigating the accident. They will examine the railroad cars to see whether the brakes failed or were set improperly, and will talk with the four crew members involved. Urine samples were taken from the crew members to test for drugs and alcohol. The runaway cars were part of a freight train that stopped near the Continental Divide to switch locomotives after a locomotive cab heater failed. The cars slipped away during the switching procedure and rolled nine miles before slamming into the three locomotives.

<HEAD>Husband Seeking Abortion For Comatose Wife Says She Would Approve</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A man who is seeking a court-sanctioned abortion for his comatose wife said Saturday he believes she would approve of his actions. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Klein </PERSON>, 34, of <LOCATION> Upper </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Brookville </LOCATION> is awaiting a decision on his petition seeking appointment as his wife's legal guardian so he can authorize an abortion that he and some doctors say could help her survive. `` It's been stressful,'' <PERSON> Klein </PERSON> said. `` It's been very frustrating. I am doing what my wife would want me to do.'' `` Inside they have ripped my guts out,'' he added. `` But my wife deserves every chance she is entitled to, and I am going to do everything in my power to see that she gets it.'' <PERSON> Klein </PERSON>'s 32-year-old wife, <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON>, is 17 weeks pregnant. She has been in a coma at <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shore </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Manhassett </LOCATION> since she was injured in a car accident Dec. 13. The hospital refused to allow an abortion for Mrs. <PERSON> Klein </PERSON> unless her husband is named her legal guardian. <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Justice <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> McCaffrey </PERSON> reserved a decision Thursday on the case, described as unprecedented by legal and medical experts, after a two-day hearing that drew supporters and opponents of abortion. <PERSON> Klein </PERSON>, an accountant, said he had hoped the decision would be a private one, as do his wife's parents, who support the decision to terminate the pregnancy. `` We did n't want any publicity,'' said <PERSON> Klein </PERSON>, saying that if his wife knew what was happening she, too, would be uncomfortable about it. `` She is a very private kind of person,'' he said. `` I just want to get the court order safe in my hands so we can at least resolve one issue and get it behind us.'' During the hearing, five medical experts for <PERSON> Klein </PERSON> testified that pregnancy decreases the chances of recovery for the comatose patient and could threaten her life. However, two other experts called by the <LOCATION> Nassau </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> district attorney testified that the pregnancy was not life-threatening. The district attorney said he entered the case, in part, to ensure that an abortion was not performed without consent. <PERSON> Klein </PERSON> visits his wife daily. She suffered extensive brain damage and has been unconscious since the accident, but is not on life-support machines. `` I talk to her,'' he said. `` I work with her arms and legs _ it's important that they do n't get stiff. ... I just have to take one day at a time.'' He said he has seen a slight improvement in his wife's condition. The couple have a 3-year-old daughter, <PERSON> Arielle </PERSON>. `` For right now, I have to be strong for my family, my daughter and my wife,'' <PERSON> Klein </PERSON> said. `` If I do n't hold up, what will be left?''

 Five people were treated for frostbite and hypothermia after a 500-mile journey in below-zero weather on an unheated Greyhound bus, a passenger and hospital spokeswoman said. `` If it had n't been for my blankets, I think we'd be in worse condition than we are now,'' said <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Missoula </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mont. </LOCATION>, who said his daughter was treated for frostbite at <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Luke </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospitals-MeritCare </ORGANIZATION> after they arrived here Friday on the bus from Billings, <PERSON> Mont </PERSON> <PERSON> Deb </PERSON> <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON>, a hospital nursing supervisor, identified the child Saturday as 4-year-old Janilynn. A total of five people from the bus were treated for cold-related maladies and later released, according to another supervisor, who declined to identify herself. The Forum newspaper of Fargo quoted one passenger as saying he blacked out for a half-hour from hypothermia. He declined to identify himself, the newspaper reported Saturday. <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> Bruggeman </PERSON>, a Greyhound supervisor in <LOCATION> Fargo </LOCATION>, said Saturday that the bus' alternator failed at <LOCATION> Forsyth </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mont. </LOCATION>, about 100 miles east of Billings and 500 miles from <LOCATION> Fargo </LOCATION>. The malfunction left the bus essentially without heat, he said. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Gravley </PERSON>, a spokesman at <ORGANIZATION> Greyhound </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>'s headquarters in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>, said the 33 original passengers were invited to transfer to a heated bus on four separate occasions along the route The first offer was made at <LOCATION> Miles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mont. </LOCATION>, about 50 miles east of <LOCATION> Forsyth </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Gravley </PERSON> said. The heated bus waited there for the cold bus, 15 passengers transferred to it, and both buses traveled together to <PERSON> Fargo </PERSON>, he said. Another five transferred 75 miles later at <LOCATION> Glendive </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mont. </LOCATION>, he said. After <LOCATION> Glendive </LOCATION>, the heated bus had standing room only, he said, adding that no other buses were available. The third and fourth offers to transfer were made in <PERSON> Dickinson </PERSON> and Sterling in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>, but no one accepted, he said. `` That was their choice, stand on the warm bus or sit on the cold bus,'' he said. Three passengers on the cold bus completed their trip and got off at <LOCATION> Bismarck </LOCATION>, leaving 10 who arrived in <LOCATION> Fargo </LOCATION> on the cold bus, <PERSON> Gravley </PERSON> said. He also said the driver had the authority to stop at any time, but passengers did not protest and some maintained that they were `` tough'' and urged the driver to continue. <PERSON> Bruggeman </PERSON> said some riders even wanted to move from the heated bus to the cold one. <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> said the bus he took from <LOCATION> Missoula </LOCATION> to Billings also had no heat. `` I'm cold and sick, and I'm going to have to tough it out,'' said <PERSON> Clark </PERSON>, who said he was returning to <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Wayne </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ind. </LOCATION>, after losing his truck-driving job in <LOCATION> Missoula </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Gravley </PERSON> denied that the second bus had a heating problem. The company is conducting an internal investigation into the matter, he said. Billings' cold continued Saturday, hitting a record low of 22 degrees below zero.

 Forces loyal to Gen. <PERSON> Andres </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> rounded up backers of the previous government Saturday to consolidate his power after a violent coup. Reports linked the nation's new leader to drug trafficking. Ousted President <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON>, who held power for 34 years, was under house arrest awaiting exile two days after the overthrow that reportedly left up to 300 dead. Onlookers cheered as portraits of <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON> were taken down from President <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON> International Airport and from the headquarters of the ruling <ORGANIZATION> Colorado </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. A high-level foreign diplomat described the 76-year-old dictator as `` a sick and depressed old man.'' But new Foreign Minister <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> Argana </PERSON> said <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON> is `` in perfect health'' and living at the in the residence of a colonel at <ORGANIZATION> Campo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Grande </ORGANIZATION>, a base outside the capital. `` I do n't know where he'll go,'' <PERSON> Argana </PERSON> told reporters. Visas are being prepared for `` various countries,'' he said, declining to say which. The new government intends to call elections, <PERSON> Argana </PERSON> added. He did not say when. <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON>, who had been <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON>'s second-in-command, vowed to restore democracy and respect human rights. A Western diplomat in <LOCATION> Asuncion </LOCATION>, speaking on condition of anonymity, said reports are common in <LOCATION> Paraguay </LOCATION> that <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> allows cocaine traffickers to use an airstrip he owns in deserted Chaco Province along the border with <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION>. However, he said the reports are unproven. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoyt </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, a professor of Latin American history at <ORGANIZATION> Indiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, said the drug smuggling allegations against <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> were common knowledge. `` It's appeared in print in a number of places. There's never been an official indictment of him however,'' said <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> Cox </ORGANIZATION> newspaper group, citing a classified <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> report, said Friday that <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> is considered by law enforcement authorities in <LOCATION> Paraguay </LOCATION> to be the country's No. 1 drug trafficker. <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON>, the 65-year-old farmer's son, lives better than his army salary would seem to allow. His house in a plush neighborhood is a mansion with a fountain in the well-manicured front yard. White House spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>, asked about <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> reports of <PERSON> Rodriquez </PERSON>'s alleged drug ties, told reporters Friday, `` We wo n't characterize our relationship to him at this point. Forces loyal to <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON>, who was sworn in Friday, detained about 20 <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON> followers and aides, raising the total to about 50, according to the leader of an anti-Stroessner political group. Officers of <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON>'s presidential escort, who defended the dictator after the coup began Thursday night, also were arrested. No number was given. <PERSON> Argana </PERSON> said most of those detained have been released. He refused to say how many people died in the coup, saying only, `` not as many as rumored.'' The Roman Catholic station <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Caritas </ORGANIZATION> said up to 200 people were killed in the fighting. A high-ranking foreign diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity, estimated fatalities at 300. Soldiers raided the house of <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON>'s justice minister, <PERSON> Eugenio </PERSON> <PERSON> Jacquet </PERSON>, carting away boxes of documents, the radio reported. It said <PERSON> Jacquet </PERSON> was en route home from <LOCATION> Caracas </LOCATION>, where he represented <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON> at the inauguration Thursday of President <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Andres </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>. The former interior minister and leder of the ruling <ORGANIZATION> Colorado </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Sabino </PERSON> <PERSON> Montanaro </PERSON>, was reportedly given shelter at the <ORGANIZATION> Honduran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION>. New details emerged about the coup. <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON>, whose <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> is the biggest and best-equipped in the 12,500-man army, apparently tried to arrest <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON> on Thursday as he dined at the home of a friend near the corps' base. <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON>'s bodyguards resisted and he escaped to the escort battalion, according to a witness who saw the exchange of gunfire. The witness said that after a battle at the barracks, he saw <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON> being driven off in his black Chevrolet between two tanks. Opposition groups said they hoped the transition boded new opportunity for them. `` I consider the overthrow of that tyrant as the most positive event in our country's political history over the last 40 years,'' said <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Andrada </PERSON> <PERSON> Nogues </PERSON>, leader of the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON> had refused to recognize the party. `` A year ago, we could n't have held this meeting,'' <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Levi </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruffinelli </PERSON>, leader of a small <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> faction, told fellow party members at his home Saturday. The <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Paraguay </LOCATION>'s other main party besides the <ORGANIZATION> Colorado </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, began efforts to patch together its many factions to take on the <ORGANIZATION> Colorado </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> in the event of elections.

<HEAD>Yusupov Defeats Spraggett In Sudden Death Playoff</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID GOODMAN</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>QUEBEC (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Artur </PERSON> <PERSON> Yusupov </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> scored a brilliant victory over <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Spraggett </PERSON> in a sudden-death playoff Saturday to win their World Chess Championship Candidates quarterfinal and advance to the semifinal stage. With both players' thinking time limited to one hour each for the entire game, <PERSON> Yusupov </PERSON>, playing black, unleashed a dazzling queen sacrifice on his 28th move to gain a crushing attack with his remaining pieces against <PERSON> Spraggett </PERSON>'s King. `` It was the best move in all the match.'' said <PERSON> Yves </PERSON> <PERSON> Boisvert </PERSON>, a Canadian chess commentator. As <PERSON> Yusupov </PERSON> steadied his nerves and waited to deliver an unstoppable checkmate on his 51st move, <PERSON> Spraggett </PERSON> ran out of time and lost the game. `` I'm not disappointed. I lost, but I think I gave it my best,'' <PERSON> Spraggett </PERSON> told reporters at a joint news conference with his opponent onstage at the playing hall in <LOCATION> Quebec </LOCATION>'s Gabrielle-Roy Library. <PERSON> Yusupov </PERSON> said <PERSON> Spraggett </PERSON> had proved his equal by holding him to a 4-4 tie over the eight games played before Saturday at a slower rate. After his victory, <PERSON> Yusupov </PERSON> rushed from the hall to tell his wife, <PERSON> Tatiana </PERSON>, of the victory. Following <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s policy of glasnost, wives of Soviet Grandasters have, in the last months, begun to travel to the west with their husbands. When the players came back to the stage, they received a standing ovation of more than a minute from the disappointed, but appreciative Canadian crowd. The winner of the Candidates, a series of knockout matches, will challenge world champion <PERSON> Garri </PERSON> <PERSON> Kasparov </PERSON> for his title in 1990. <PERSON> Yusupov </PERSON>, a 28-year-old Muscovite joins British Grandmaster <PERSON> Jonathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Speelman </PERSON> in the semifinals. <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Dvoretsky </PERSON>, a Soviet international master who acts as <PERSON> Yusupov </PERSON>'s second, said <PERSON> Yusupov </PERSON> would probably play former world champion and fellow Soviet <PERSON> Anatoly </PERSON> <PERSON> Karpov </PERSON> in the semifinals. <PERSON> Karpov </PERSON> is currently leading <LOCATION> Iceland </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Johann </PERSON> <PERSON> Hjartarson </PERSON> 3-1 in the six-game duel underway in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>, and requires only one draw from two games to win the contest. <PERSON> Speelman </PERSON> is likely to meet either <PERSON> Lajos </PERSON> <PERSON> Portisch </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> or Dutch Grandmaster <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Timman </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Portisch </LOCATION> is leading their contest in <LOCATION> Antwerp </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION> 2-1 after three games. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Finta </PERSON>, the general director of the <ORGANIZATION> Quebec </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chess </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> who oragnized the contest with the support of <LOCATION> Quebec </LOCATION>'s provincial government said the players would split the $ 42,000 prize fund becasue the match was tied after the initial six games. Both semifinals will be staged together in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> in the autumn. Each contest wil feature a prize $ 125,000, with five-eighths to the winner and three-eighths for the loser. In a remarakable incident at the 1983 Candidates quarterfinal between <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Huebner </PERSON> of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and former world champion <PERSON> Vassily </PERSON> <PERSON> Smyslov </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Velden </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>, organizers turned to the roulettte table to break the tie. <PERSON> Huebner </PERSON> refused to attend, and on the first spin, the ball landed on the zero. But on the second roll, the ball landed on red and gave <PERSON> Smyslov </PERSON> victory. He went on to reach the Candidates final before being knockout out by <PERSON> Kasparov </PERSON>.

<HEAD>Miswiring Found In Five 737's</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Inspections of <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> jetliners ordered by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> have turned up five more cases of miswiring in twin-jet <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 737s, a federal official said Saturday. The latest findings were wrong connections on fire extinguisher bottles in engines on four <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 737s operated by Australian airlines and a problem with an indicator light for an engine on a 737-300 operated by <ORGANIZATION> USAir </ORGANIZATION>. The indicator light problem involved an incorrect light going on in the cockpit, not a wrong switch being activated, The <ORGANIZATION> Seattle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> reported in Saturday's editions. <PERSON> Mitch </PERSON> <PERSON> Barker </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> office said no more details about the miswirings or the Australian airlines involved were available. The inspection of about 740 <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 737s, 747s, 757s and 767s built since 1981 was ordered by the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> to put to rest concerns about miswiring of fire-warning and fire-suppressant systems in engines and cargo areas. Concerns about miswiring, or cross-wiring, arose during the investigation of the Jan. 8 crash of a British <ORGANIZATION> Midland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> 737-400 that killed 44 people. Investigators questioned whether miswiring caused the pilot to shut down the wrong engine. The cause of that crash has not been determined. Most foreign aviation agencies ordered their carriers to make similar inspections. The inspections were advised previously by <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> in correspondence with its customers. Irregularities in 17 aircraft have been reported in the past few weeks. <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> also acknowledged this week that it had put decals mislabeling wiring connectors on 10 737-300s and -400 s that had been delivered to customers in December and January <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> said none of those planes had actually been miswired or had connections improperly made. He said new decals were sent to the airlines.

Ambassador to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> Winston Lord. The meeting took place at <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>'s state guesthouse, where <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON> is staying. According to a copy of the Baker letter provided by <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON>, <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> expressed <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> `` appreciation for your indispensable leadership in the valiant struggle of the <LOCATION> Cambodian </LOCATION> people to regain their independence.'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said, `` without question, your leadership is crucial to achieving an acceptable Cambodian settlement, both as the head of an interim government preceding elections and as a symbol and focus for the unity of your people. `` We consider it vital that you remain involved in the ongoing diplomatic processes, and that your views be conveyed to all involved parties at every opportunity.'' <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON> leads one of three China-backed forces fighting Vietnamese troops in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southeast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Asian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> ASEAN </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- want <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON> to head a coalition government to take power after <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s pullout, tentatively set for September. The prince is thought to be the only man with broad enough support to unify his nation, but his unpredictable diplomatic ploys have also complicated efforts to resolve the conflict. He has on several occasions resigned as president of the three-party resistance government because of differences with his coalition partners. Last month he announced he would boycott all further peace talks because <PERSON> Hun </PERSON> <PERSON> Sen </PERSON>, prime minister of the Vietnam-backed government in <LOCATION> Phnom </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Penh </LOCATION>, had rejected his proposals for introducing an international peacekeeping force after <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> ends its 10-year occupation. He has since modified his position, saying he will support any unanimous agreements coming out of talks in <LOCATION> Jakarta </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION> later this month among the warring factions. <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON> was ousted in a 1970 coup he alleged was engineered by the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION>. However, his faction now receives non-military aid from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, which calls for an end to the Vietnamese occupation and the holding of free elections in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>.

 Police raided city government offices in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>, reportedly looking for evidence of official misconduct in a community so broke it ca n't afford toilet paper in City Hall. <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> served warrants at City Hall and spent the day Friday seizing boxes of financial records, a newspaper reported Saturday. The raid, by agents of the state's Division of Criminal Investigation, followed months of allegations that <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> officials were improperly using tax money, the <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Louis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post-Dispatch </ORGANIZATION> reported. The government of the impoverished city has found it increasingly hard to function. City Hall restrooms have been without toilet paper and soap for months. When light bulbs burn out, they are not replaced. Employees wait between four and seven weeks for their paychecks, and vendors routinely sue the city for non-payment. Mayor <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Officer </PERSON> has acknowledged he has diverted some tax money collected for specific purposes, including pensions, to pay routine city bills. He defends the action, saying he has no choice. Some officials at City Hall appeared almost panicked when the state police arrived Friday, the <ORGANIZATION> Post-Dispatch </ORGANIZATION> reported. According to complaints attached to the search warrants, the investigation centers on allegations that: _ The city has been diverting money collected for its employees' pensions to its general _ The city owes more than $ 3 million to the pension fund; this debt has endangered the pensions of city employees who will retire in the future _ The city has been diverting motor fuel tax money that it gets from the state In October, the state cut off the money and ordered the city to repay about $ 3 million that state audits determined the city had misused. _ Someone has been forging the signature of City Treasurer <PERSON> Charlotte </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> on sewer lien releases Thousands of dollars that should have been paid to the treasurer's office and put into the city's coffers have never arrived, <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> told state police. `` Legality does not seem to be a concern here'' at <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hall </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> said after the raid. `` It's a great concern of mine when people are using my signature and it's not my signature.'' No arrests were made, and no target of the investigation has been identified. The investigation may continue for months, the newspaper said, citing sources it did not identify.

 Thousands marched through <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> on Saturday to protest policies of a radical right-wing political party that won seats in a local election. In the northern city of <LOCATION> Rotenberg </LOCATION>, right-wing demonstrators drew counter-protesters. `` Nazis Out of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>!'' and `` Foreigners stay _ Nazis away!'' chanted protesters in the crowd estimated at nearly 10,000, in the peaceful afternoon procession along <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>'s famed Kurfuerstendamm A right-wing extremist party, the Republicans, campaigned on an arch-conservative platform that included a call to oust foreign workers from the city. The party won 7.5 percent of the <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> vote in ballotting last Sunday, giving it 11 seats in the local parliament and the right to send two representatives to the federal Bundestag next year. Their positions won broader support than pollsters predicted, reflecting the volatile and growing nationalist sentiments stirred by housing and job shortages that are especially acute in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>. However, moderate and left-wing supporters have staged a number of protests against the Republicans and their policies since the surprising election outcome. In <LOCATION> Rotenburg </LOCATION> near <LOCATION> Bremen </LOCATION>, 200 right-wing supporters demonstrated for the the Free German <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, drawing a counter-protest by 1,200 opponents. Four hundred police officers kept the displays reasonably peaceful, with only one minor injury from a thrown rock reported.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and top advisers conferred for more than 3 -LCB- hours on the savings and loan crisis Saturday, but the president made no decisions, the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> said. The advisers _ including <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>, Budget Director <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Darman </PERSON> and Chief of Staff <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> _ traveled to the president's Camp David, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, retreat for a working session from 11 a.m. to 1 p.m., said <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON>, a presidential spokesman. <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> joined the group for lunch, which broke up shortly after 2:30 p.m. `` Options were presented to the president. He made no decisions at the meeting,'' <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> said. Among proposals that were to have been presented to the president were plans to raise $ 54 billion over three years through complicated financing arrangements based largely on boosting deposit insurance premiums paid by the institution, according to a report Saturday in <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>. The plan would call for banks to pay 18 cents in insurance premiums for every $ 100 in deposits, while savings and loans would pay 25 cents per $ 100, according to unnamed congressional aides cited by the newspaper. Banks currently pay 8 cents per $ 100 in deposits, while <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Ls pay 21 cents. Also, the Times' Sunday editions quoted industry officials as saying the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration is studying a proposal to take control of the 350 insolvent savings and loan associations and place them under the management of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deposit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. Advocates argue that the <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION>, with 4,000 bank liquidators and a reputation for toughness, would be better able to bring the problem under control than the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, which has a smaller staff and is less experienced, the Times said.

<TEXT>
 In a lurid <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> trial, <PERSON> Rock </PERSON> <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON>'s one-time lover has testified that the actor had unsafe sex with him up to five times a week although he knew he had AIDS, and lied about having the deadly disease <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON> fiercely kept secret his homosexual life for more than 25 years before admitting he had AIDS in 1985. But during testimony in recent weeks, blond, clean-cut <PERSON> Marc </PERSON> <PERSON> Christian </PERSON>, a 35-year-old unemployed bartender, has glaringly exposed <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON>'s love life. The trial stems from Christian's $ 11 million lawsuit against <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON>'s estate and the actor's former secretary, <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>. <PERSON> Christian </PERSON> alleges that he suffers extreme emotional distress for not being told <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON> had AIDS. To prove his claim, <PERSON> Christian </PERSON> has testified that he and <LOCATION> Hudson </LOCATION> engaged in unprotected oral and anal sex for eight months, three to five times a week, after <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON> learned he had AIDS in June 1984. <PERSON> Christian </PERSON> said that although the actor lost weight rapidly, developed neck sores and had profuse night sweats when they lived together at <LOCATION> Hudson </LOCATION>'s hilltop mansion _ all symptoms of AIDS _ he denied he had the disease until shortly before his death in October 1985. <PERSON> Christian </PERSON> said he has tested negative for exposure to the AIDS virus but lives in fear of contracting the disease and dying. <PERSON> Christian </PERSON> testified that he met <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON> in October 1982 and moved in with him 13 months later. In June 1984, the actor learned he had AIDS, but kept the illness a secret, <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> said. Attorneys for the <LOCATION> Hudson </LOCATION> estate and <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> contend the pair's sexual relationship ended in February 1984 after <PERSON> Christian </PERSON> allegedly told <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON> he had engaged in sex for money with women and other men The attorneys contend that <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON> allowed <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> to continue living in the actor's house until after his death because <PERSON> Christian </PERSON> allegedly threatened to blackmail him by publishing love letters the actor wrote. The defense has tried to portray <PERSON> Christian </PERSON> as a publicity-seeking gigolo who filed the lawsuit after he learned he was left out of <LOCATION> Hudson </LOCATION>'s will. <PERSON> Christian </PERSON> said he feels like a leper because of his contact with <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON>, the once-handsome screen idol who wooed the likes of <PERSON> Doris </PERSON> <PERSON> Day </PERSON>, <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> and <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> in dozens of movie and television roles. The trial has attracted spectators daily. But for those who may have expected to hear about the glamour and excitement of one of <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION>'s leading stars, the trial has yielded only the seamiest of insight. Testimony has focused primarily on sex _ how much sex Christian and <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON> had, what type they had, and, in questions from defense lawyers, whether they had sex at all. Christian's attorney, <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Rhoden </PERSON>, has repeatedly apologized to the jury for his client's graphic testimony. The jury is expected to hear closing arguments in a few days.

His visit capped a week of diplomatic efforts to bring <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s warring factions to terms as <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> prepares to pull all its troops out by Feb. 15, ending a massive military involvement that began in December 1979 to prop up the Marxist government in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>.

Soviet forces entered <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> in 1979 to replace one Marxist government with another. They agreed to withdraw under a U.N.-brokered accord.

 Vice President <PERSON> Salvador </PERSON> <PERSON> Laurel </PERSON> returned Saturday from a visit with ailing <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> and appealed to President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> to let the man she ousted die in his homeland. Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> on Sunday refused to meet with <PERSON> Laurel </PERSON> as he requested, and she said he should `` share with the Filipino people'' the results of his visit to <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> instead of disclosing it to her first, a presidential palace statement said. `` President <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> felt that there should be nothing secret in what Mr. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> sought to convey to her,'' said the statement. Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> had disavowed <ORGANIZATION> Laurel </ORGANIZATION>'s trip, which <PERSON> Laurel </PERSON> said he made at <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' request. Laurel's relations with Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> have been strained since he quit as foreign minister over policy differences in 1987. In August, he accused Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> of incompetence, demanded her resignation, and joined an opposition alliance. <PERSON> Laurel </PERSON> said he was appealing to Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>'s `` sense of Christian and moral values'' to allow <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> to return. He said doctors at <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Francis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> told him <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> had lost the will to live and may not last through the year. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>, admitted to the hospital Jan. 15, underwent a tracheotomy Wednesday to drain fluids from his lungs and has been breathing through a respirator since then. He was hospitalized twice in December for congestive heart failure. <PERSON> Laurel </PERSON> said that when he met <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> for 35 minutes, the 71-year-old former president had a fever of 103 and weighed less than 100 pounds. At times <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> could not speak or recognize visitors, he said. Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> has refused to allow <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> to return for security reasons because the former president still enjoys a substantial following in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> has been living in <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION> since a military-civilian uprising toppled his 20-year regime and swept Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> to power in February 1986. On Saturday, the Philippine Daily Inquirer quoted Cabinet Secretary <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> as saying the government would even refuse to allow <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> to be buried in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>. Before <PERSON> Laurel </PERSON> left Thursday, unconfirmed newspaper reports said he and a Filipino businessman were trying to work out a deal to let <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> return in exchange for giving back part of the billions of dollars he is accused of embezzling. Asked if <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> made such an offer, <ORGANIZATION> Laurel </ORGANIZATION> replied he was `` not at liberty to answer that.'' He told another reporter no offer was made. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Imelda </PERSON>, are under <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> indictment, accused of plundering the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> of more than $ 100 million and stashing much of it in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. They would need permission from the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> to leave the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.

 Parade-watchers and party-goers bundled up Saturday against a suddenly cold Carnival weekend, the start of a four-day spectacle expected to draw nearly 2 million merrymakers by <PERSON> Mardi </PERSON> <PERSON> Gras </PERSON>. Nine parades rolled Saturday in metropolitan <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>, including the extravagant Endymion with huge floats and celebrity riders such as <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Savage </PERSON>, the child television star of `` The Wonder Years,'' and pop singers <PERSON> Daryl </PERSON> <PERSON> Hall </PERSON> and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Oates </PERSON>. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> police estimated this will be the biggest <LOCATION> Mardi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gras </LOCATION> ever, with 1.7 million revelers lining the streets and jamming the French Quarter on Fat Tuesday, the last blowout before the solemn season of Lent. Authorities said 1.5 million people attended the 1988 celebration. Police reported few problems during the parades Saturday, which drew thousands of revelers. The lone injury was a float rider who required stitches after she was hit in the head by an undetermined object during an all-women's parade. The day was cloudy, cold and damp, with temperatures in the 40s and chilling winds. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said an arctic air mass would drop temperatures into the 30s through Tuesday, but that did n't deter Saturday night's parade-stalkers. `` The crowd is really just as big as normal. As long as it does n't rain, they'll come out,'' said <PERSON> Hilda </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramsey </PERSON>, desk clerk at the Hummingbird Hotel, along the Endymion route. Some roisterers sought internal and external warmth in bars along oak-lined <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Charles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Avenue </LOCATION>, a major parade route. `` They're here anyway and they're going to go drinking,'' said <PERSON> Matt </PERSON> <PERSON> Hendricks </PERSON> at Fat Harry's. `` Instead of standing outside, it just gets packed inside. The cold weather makes no difference.'' For others visitors, there were worse things to deal with than the damp, winter weather _ the city's notorious hard-line parking regulations and always-ready tow trucks. `` I thought my car was stolen,'' said <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Jacob </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>, whose rental car was town away before a parade earlier this week. `` But after they checked the license, they told me, ` We have it.' I could n't believe it,'' he said. The New Orleans Streets Department begins towing two hours before parade time. Signs in Carnival colors of purple, green and gold alert drivers to the financial hazards of blocking parade routes. For some <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> students, the problem was n't cars, it was hotel space. When 10 buses from <LOCATION> Gainesville </LOCATION> pulled up to the Days Inn in suburban <PERSON> Kenner </PERSON> on Friday, nearly 200 of the 600 students learned they did n't have a place to sleep. `` We had all made our commitments to come here _ paid the travel agency for everything in full,'' said student <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> McClure </PERSON>. `` But somewhere along the way, somebody screwed up.'' Five hours later, Days Inn Manager <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Gator </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Travel </ORGANIZATION> owners <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Fahlen </PERSON> found 15 rooms to handle 60 students, while the rest were put in rooms that already held two students each.

In <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>, police said they arrested more than two dozen people who attempted to block the entrance to the parking lot at the Reproductive Health Services clinic. They declined to disclose the exact number of arrests. The protesters laid down in a driveway to block cars attempting to get into the lot, but police picked them up and put them into a van. About 30 officers formed a shield around the front door of the clinic, keeping the protesters away from the entrance. Several hundred pro-choice demonstrators marched past the health center during the protest, but there was no confrontation. The protest came on the final day of a three-day event that the <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Louis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pro-Life </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Direct </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> called `` Rescue St. <PERSON> Louis </PERSON>.''

 Telephone party lines and dial-a-date numbers are being banned in <LOCATION> Britian </LOCATION>, where critics say teen-agers may be too hung up on the costly social calls. <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telecom </ORGANIZATION>, the telephone company, ended its own service a year ago and announced Friday that it was indefinitely suspending the other privately run `` chatlines'' effective Monday. `` We have taken this action in the public interest following acute and growing public concern over chatlines, which we feel has brought the whole service into disrepute,'' said a company statement. Critics of the party lines _ with which people can call a number and speak to like-minded strangers _ welcomed news of the cutoff but expressed worry over those in debt to the telephone company. Costs for the services were 66 cents per minute during peak hours and 44 cents per minute during off-peak times. Newspapers have printed stories of parents facing phone bills of $ 5,000 to $ 10,000 run up by their children. Although <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telecom </ORGANIZATION> said it could not waive high bills `` we will work out a way in which an account can be paid which is best for the family,'' said <PERSON> Duncan </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>, director of products and strategy.

<HEAD>Major Gauguin Retrospective Opens in Paris</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARILYN AUGUST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Some 300 works by <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Gauguin </PERSON>, the French painter who rejected the comforts of middle-class life to pursue art in the Polynesian wild, have gone on show at the Grand Palais in the first major retrospective of his work in 40 years. `` <PERSON> Gauguin </PERSON>,'' running through April 24, is a $ 2 million co-production with the <ORGANIZATION> Art </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gallery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Art </ORGANIZATION>, which presented slightly different versions of the show last year. The French have not had a comprehensive look at <LOCATION> Gauguin </LOCATION> since 1949, and they have wholeheartedly embraced his works. The show has been billed as the blockbuster art event of the season, daily drawing some 6,000 visitors. Critics say the show's highlight are 11 paintings on loan from the <ORGANIZATION> Hermitage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Museum </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Pushkin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Museum </ORGANIZATION>, which rarely leave the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. They include `` Pastorales Tahitiennes'' -LRB- 1892 -RRB-, a brightly colored bucolic scene which <PERSON> Gauguin </PERSON> believed to be his `` best'' Tahitian effort. With its flat surface, exotic flowers and sensuous women in native dress, the work sums up the essence of <LOCATION> Gauguin </LOCATION>. The distorted perspective and bold use of color, which he once called a `` profound, mysterious language, a language of the dream,'' would later influence works by <PERSON> Pablo </PERSON> <PERSON> Picasso </PERSON>, <PERSON> Henri </PERSON> <PERSON> Matisse </PERSON> and other 20th century masters. The show begins with <PERSON> Gauguin </PERSON>'s early work, including such paintings as `` Effet de Neige'' -LRB- 1883 -RRB-, a wintery village scene reminiscent of <PERSON> Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Monet </PERSON>'s `` La Pie.'' In the early years, when working as a respectable stockbroker and painting on the weekends, <PERSON> Gauguin </PERSON> tried to master impressionist techniques. Later, reacting against realism, he would reject them altogether, opting instead for mystery and exoticism. <PERSON> Gauguin </PERSON> sought a primitive naturalness where ever he went and became dependent on it for stimulation. In 1886 he left <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> for <LOCATION> Pont-Aven </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Brittany </LOCATION>. There his eye focused on the elaborate head pieces worn by the native women. Two years later, he went to <LOCATION> Arles </LOCATION>, in southern <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, where he painted the same sun flowers and haystacks <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Gogh </PERSON> immortalized. Later, during two different stays in the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION>, he would depict the tribal rituals and superstitions of `` true savages.'' Besides bringing together so many remarkable paintings executed after 1895 when he left <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> never to return, the <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> exhibition features two important works not displayed in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. In `` The Vision After the Sermon _ Jacob Wrestling With the Angel'' -LRB- 1888 -RRB-, <PERSON> Gauguin </PERSON> experimented with pure color and reduced all forms to their outlines. In `` Papa Moe'' -LRB- 1893 -RRB- he portrayed a native woman drinking water from a jungle source against a lush backround of tropical flora and fauna. Also on show is `` <PERSON> Aita </PERSON> <PERSON> Tamari </PERSON> <PERSON> Vahine </PERSON> <PERSON> Judith </PERSON> Te Parari'' -LRB- 1893-94 -RRB-, a bizarre portrait of a naked Polynesian adolescent posing with an orange monkey. <PERSON> Anna </PERSON> the Javanese, as she was known, was 13 years old when she became <PERSON> Gauguin </PERSON>'s mistress and accompanied him back to <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> from the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> after his first stay there. On a visit to <PERSON> Brittany </PERSON>, the flamboyantly dressed <PERSON> Gauguin </PERSON>, <PERSON> Anna </PERSON> and her monkey were laughed at by sailors, prompting the artist to pick a fight. He sustained a broken foot and was bedridden for weeks. <PERSON> Anna </PERSON> left him, returned to <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> and robbed his studio of paintings and other valuables, leaving him practically destitute. The show ends on an optimistic note: the monumental door frame sculpted in redwood and taken from the hut in the remote <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> island of <LOCATION> Marquesas </LOCATION> where <PERSON> Gauguin </PERSON> died miserable and alone in 1903 at the age of 55. Carved with flowers and nude native women, it bears the inscription `` The House of Pleasure,'' and sums up <PERSON> Gauguin </PERSON>'s life credo: `` Be in love, and you will be happy.''

The political ferment of 1988, a year of unprecedented losses at the polls for the ruling <ORGANIZATION> Institutional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, sparked a wave of graphic daring. More than one artist has depicted <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s diminutive, jug-eared, balding new chief executive, <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Gortari </PERSON>, as a Disneyesque rodent named <PERSON> Mickey </PERSON>. `` They are tough, very tough,'' <PERSON> Monsivais </PERSON> said approvingly, although President <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> seems to be getting a bit more cartoon respect than he did as candidate and president-elect. <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>, head of the New York-based Cartoonists and <ORGANIZATION> Writers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Syndicate </ORGANIZATION>, agrees that something special is afoot. `` <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> has a fantastically high number of exceptional cartoonists,'' said <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>, who syndicates many of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s best. `` They are high-caliber graphic artists. It makes their work very, very effective.'' <PERSON> Rogelio </PERSON> <PERSON> Naranjo </PERSON>'s razor-sharp pen has been on the cutting edge for years. Day by day, stroke by ironic stroke, <PERSON> Naranjo </PERSON> has chiseled away at the pretensions, foibles, hypocrisies and taboos that have buttressed a one-party government for 60 years. He's honed a sixth sense for what he can get away with in his 22 years of political cartooning. `` It's like a mystical thing in my work. I navigate the line that divides what is possible and what is n't,'' he said. When it comes to government policy, now `` there are very few limits.'' Government austerity programs and <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s crippling foreign debt provoke some of the bitterest commentary. <PERSON> Naranjo </PERSON> resorted, literally, to gallows humor, depicting a plump man representing the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> picking the pocket of a starved, barefoot and hanged worker. <PERSON> Bulmaro </PERSON> <PERSON> Castellanos </PERSON>, who draws under the monicker Magu, showed <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON>, architect of an austerity pact that controlled wages and prices, as a crazed workman armed with a chainsaw standing over a bloody body skewered by the pact. The generals are another story. Both official censorship and self-censorship have a long history in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, where few care to rouse the military and endanger decades of civilian rule. `` The army is the most taboo thing,'' <PERSON> Naranjo </PERSON> said. `` Everyone assumes the army is a great power in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> that can influence the government in a radical and substantial manner.'' As for the Virgin of <LOCATION> Guadalupe </LOCATION>, even <PERSON> Naranjo </PERSON>, who has lampooned the pope, says such a revered symbol can not be used to make a point. A museum exhibit that included irreverent paintings of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s patron saint was shuttered after a public outcry Although most of their satire is directed at the ruling establishment, the cartoonists do take occasional pokes at the opposition. <PERSON> Efren </PERSON> <PERSON> Maldonado </PERSON> showed opposition leader <PERSON> Cuauhtemoc </PERSON> <PERSON> Cardenas </PERSON> as a giant head supported by a magic carpet in the image of former President <PERSON> Lazaro </PERSON> <PERSON> Cardenas </PERSON>, <PERSON> Cuauhtemoc </PERSON>'s father and a national hero. Cartoonists such as <PERSON> Naranjo </PERSON> and <PERSON> Helio </PERSON> <PERSON> Flores </PERSON> began stretching the limits of the possible as founders of the cheeky humor magazine <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Garrapata </ORGANIZATION> in 1968, a year of political upheaval in much of the world, including <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. `` The notion of reverence disappeared,'' <PERSON> Monsivais </PERSON> said. In a show of impatience with the one-party status quo, thousands took to the streets. The unrest lasted only a few months, until the army opened fire on a demonstration in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, killing scores. Not long after the massacre, <PERSON> La </PERSON> <PERSON> Garrapata </PERSON> co-founder <PERSON> Eduardo </PERSON> <PERSON> del </PERSON> <PERSON> Rio </PERSON>, who signs himself <PERSON> Rius </PERSON>, was kidnapped by uniformed men and forced to stand next to an empty grave in front of what turned out to be a mock firing squad. Subsequent administrations began slowly opening a safety valve that included tolerance for press freedom. The Mexican chief executive was traditionally above reproach, no matter how unpopular. Even now <PERSON> Maldonado </PERSON>, the first cartoonist to put Dumbo ears on <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON>, insists he intends no disrepect. <PERSON> Flores </PERSON> remembers a cartoon of President <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON> <PERSON> Portillo </PERSON>, who left office to almost universal relief in 1982. `` He was drawn as <PERSON> Hamlet </PERSON> _ but very, very handsome, very athletic,'' <PERSON> Flores </PERSON> said. With <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON>, cartoonists have gone far beyond making fun of his ears and his austere economics, attacking the very legitimacy of his presidency. His election was marred by accusations of fraud and <PERSON> Cardenas </PERSON> still claims that he won. The most audacious cartoons appear in El Universal, a mainline newspaper that gave significant space to the opposition in 1988, and in two publications born after 1968: <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jornada </ORGANIZATION>, a liberal daily, and the feisty weekly Proceso. But both <PERSON> Naranjo </PERSON> and <PERSON> Flores </PERSON>, who just won his second Gran Prix from the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Salon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cartoon </ORGANIZATION>, say even El Universal sometimes refuses a cartoon it considers too daring. After the July 6 presidential election, which many say the ruling party rigged, <PERSON> Flores </PERSON> did a sketch portraying <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> as Dr. <PERSON> Caligari </PERSON>, the eerie protagonist of a classic silent horror film. El Universal rejected it without explanation, he said. The cartoon later ran in an opposition paper.

<HEAD>Largest Bailout Ever: A Ride for Taxpayers or Best Deal Possible?</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Economics Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The savings and loan crisis represents the largest government bailout in history, an estimated $ 85 billion rescue that has raised a multitude of questions over whether taxpayers are being taken for a ride. Critics contend the bailouts negotiated by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> are huge government giveaways with generous benefits for the purchasers of sick <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Ls that will saddle taxpayers with billions of dollars of open-ended obligations. Board Chairman <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Danny </PERSON> <PERSON> Wall </PERSON> disputes those charges, saying the agency, which regulates the country's 3,000 <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Ls, is doing the best it can to handle a gigantic problem with limited resources. In December, the bank board negotiated deals involving 75 bankrupt S & amp; Ls in a year-end frenzy spurred by the fact that lucrative tax benefits available to the buyers were to be slashed in half on Jan. 1. The $ 16.7 billion in government aid promised in December alone dwarfed the combined $ 2.8 billion handed out to <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, the two previous record holders as the largest government bailouts. To attract buyers, the government included such sweeteners as: _ Multimillion-dollar tax breaks to some of the country's wealthiest investors that in many cases have far exceeded what the investors put up to purchase the S & amp; _ Government guarantees extending over the next decade that make many of the purchases virtually risk-free to the new S & amp; L owners _ Lucrative pay packages, which in one case will provide the manager of a conglomeration of failed <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Ls with a salary of $ 1 million a year for the next five years Rep. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Leach </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Iowa </LOCATION>, calls the deals, with their big tax breaks, a `` back-door raid on the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Treasury.'' `` One of the impressive aspects of these deals is that an outsider can march in with very little capital and utilize substantial tax benefits,'' <PERSON> Leach </PERSON> said. `` If the thrift investment works, the outsider makes a riskless killing. If it does n't, because of the nature of deposit insurance, the outsider has the right simply to walk away.'' With the government, once more, left holding the bag. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> O. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bowsher </PERSON>, head of the watchdog <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>, told <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> the bailouts are so complex that just monitoring them will strain the bank board's resources. All of the controversy is coming as the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration and <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> are trying to find a way to pay for the bailouts, past and future. The <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> estimates that in the deals negotiated so far, including 205 institutions closed in 1988, regulators have spent or promised to spend $ 26 billion more than they will take in over the next decade. The <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> projects that $ 35 billion more will be needed to handle 350 insolvent institutions still operating. In a report last week, the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> recommended that the government move promptly to take control of the remaining insolvent S & amp; Ls to isolate them from the healthy part of the industry. For years, badly managed <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Ls were allowed to remain open because federal regulators did n't have the money to close them and pay off depositors. All the while, the eventual bailout costs to the federal government were mounting by $ 1 billion a month. It is this crunch that has left the bank board, which regulates S & amp; Ls but not banks, scrambling to craft inventive ways to handle the mess. Consider a medium-sized S & amp; L with $ 1 billion in assets and $ 2 billion in liabilities. The assets are home mortgages and real estate loans, the stocks in trade of an S & amp; L. The liabilities are depositors' savings. The institution is insolvent, with a negative net worth of $ 1 billion. If the bank board closed the <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; L, the government would have to pay out $ 2 billion immediately to depositors, who are protected by federal insurance. Regulators would hope to recover the $ 1 billion representing the failed institution's assets as it collected loan payments and sold off repossessed properties. This traditional approach, still used by regulators of the nation's 13,000 banks, requires huge up-front payments while waiting years to recoup part of the expense. That is a luxury S & amp; L regulators do n't have because their insurance fund, unlike the bank fund, is busted. Instead, the bank board has hit upon a strategy that for the first time makes the government the guarantor not only of deposits but of bad loans as well. Instead of taking over bad debts, the board is leaving them with the new institutions and guaranteeing the new owners certain profit levels for managing the soured loans. The bank board's bailout strategy features these elements: _ PROMISSORY NOTES These notes are provided by the board to bring an institution's net worth back up to zero. For an institution with a $ 1 billion negative net worth, that would mean pumping up its assets with a $ 1 billion promissory note. The notes, which are typically for 10 years, often carry an interest rate 2 percentage points higher than the cost that other financial institutions in the region are paying to obtain funds. For many new institutions, their biggest single asset is a government note. In 1988, the bank board issued $ 14 billion in promissory notes and now has more than $ 20 billion in such notes outstanding. _ GOVERNMENT GUARANTEES In its year-end rush to close deals, the bank board agreed to protect new owners against losses on old loans over a 10-year period. These guarantees include `` capital loss coverage,'' whereby the government agrees to cover any losses on the book value of a loan when it is eventually sold, and `` yield maintenance agreements,'' in which the government promises to make up any loss of interest income on loans. Many of the agreements covered every loan in a failed S & amp; L except for still-performing mortgages on single-family homes. These guarantees carried a price tag of $ 18 billion last year. _ TAX BREAKS The board's assistance in the form of promissory notes and guarantees is tax free. In addition, S & amp; L purchasers have been allowed to deduct bad loans that had not been written off the failed institution's books. Congressional critics have complained because these tax write-offs can be carried from the acquired <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; L to the investors' other businesses Corporate takeover specialist <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> O. </PERSON> <PERSON> Perelman </PERSON>, the head of <ORGANIZATION> Revlon </ORGANIZATION> cosmetics, came away with tax breaks worth $ 900 million in his purchase of a group of failed <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Ls, three times the capital he put into the deal. In all, the bank board dealt away $ 5 billion in tax breaks for 1988. Beyond the tax breaks, the bank board projects that the <PERSON> Perelman </PERSON> deal will cost the government $ 5.1 billion, including $ 2.9 billion in loan guarantees.

 Included in the <PERSON> Perelman </PERSON> agreement was authorization to pay <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> banking executive <ORGANIZATION> Gerald </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> J. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> $ 1 million annually to manage the newly created institution, <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gibraltar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>. That deal left lawmakers fuming. Rep. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Schumer </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, said, `` The public will not stand for that kind of salary because, indirectly, it's taxpayer money.'' Revelations such as these have prompted six congressional committees to launch investigations. The <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> is sifting through the deals and one court suit has already been filed by disappointed bidders alleging the government acted improperly. But bank board officials insist they have put together the best deals possible, maintaining that the favorable terms were necessary to attract new capital and new investors into the troubled industry. `` I would rather be criticized for having acted than not having acted,'' Wall says. Critics contend that the bank board deals are a recipe for disaster. The new owners do n't have a lot of capital in the deals or, often, much experience in running S & amp; Ls. In some cases, the failed S & amp; Ls were turned over to home builders or real estate developers with an inherent conflict of interest in running a financial institution. Some critics say <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> should not approve the money to mop up the S & amp; L mess without changing the bank board's rules. The <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> said the board's current approach, with its heavy use of government subsidies, could actually worsen the problem by making it more difficult for marginal S & amp; Ls to survive without the subsidies. <PERSON> Lowell </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON>, a financial analyst for <ORGANIZATION> McKinsey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, warns that the board's flood of deals has created a `` new interest group of rich, powerful individuals who will fight to protect the sweetheart deals they have struck,'' further complicating congressional efforts to resolve the crisis. As if those were n't enough problems, some in the industry worry that the bank board deals will work only if the record peacetime economic expansion continues. `` These deals were built on certain assumptions on interest rates and economic conditions and if those turn south, you could have a second round of failures,'' said <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Riedy </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institutions </ORGANIZATION>, an industry lobbying group.

<HEAD>Despite Regulatory Actions, S&amp;L Crisis Far From Over In Texas</HEAD>

<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 To assess the size of the savings and loan problem in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, you need only look at the skyline of <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>? The <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> capital has 39 million square feet of office space downtown. In the <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> area alone, almost an equal amount of office space is empty, according to <ORGANIZATION> Cushman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Wakefield </PERSON>, a real estate research firm. Much of that real estate is now foreclosed and owned by the state's savings and loans, and the dead space remains one of the biggest problems for the nation's struggling thrift industry. Despite last year's rescue of nearly one-third of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>' thrifts, the savings and loan business wo n't rebound, experts say, until the state's economy recovers and tenants start to fill up all those empty, money-guzzling buildings. It could take years. `` Unfortunately, their -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Ls -RRB- greatest exposure is to the weakest segment of the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> economy,'' said <PERSON> Alex </PERSON> <PERSON> Sheshunoff </PERSON>, an <LOCATION> Austin </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, banking expert. `` It's a bit of a spiral.'' Half the repossessed assets now owned by the nation's <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Ls is in the Lone Star state. <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> savings and loans own so much repossessed real estate _ nearly $ 13 billion worth _ they literally ca n't give it all away. <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> got the nation into the S & amp; L mess, and <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> has continued to make it worse. The thrift industry lost $ 8.8 billion in the first nine months of 1988, and $ 8.3 billion of that was lost in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. Of the $ 38.2 billion spent last year by regulators to clean up the colossal mess, $ 25.2 billion was spent in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. Yet after closing or merging 88 insolvent <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Ls last year _ nearly a third of all the S & amp; Ls in the state _ there are still 65 to 70 that regulators have n't gotten to yet. `` The ones that have the most notoriety as far as the fraud have been addressed,'' said <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Barclay </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dallas </ORGANIZATION>. `` But it's a moving target ... Are there more -LRB- insolvents -RRB- coming on stream? Yeah, there probably will be additional ones, but they'll be smaller.'' <PERSON> Barclay </PERSON>, one of the architects of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Southwest Plan,'' says that most of the remaining large <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> insolvent thrifts will be dealt with by summer, that losses will begin to end this year, and that regulators are making progress and have the situation under control. That still does n't mean the thrift crisis is over in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, however. There are other areas of concern: _ Despite reports of widespread fraud that contributed billions of dollars to the <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; L crisis, only a handful of S & amp; L officials have been indicted. The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> has assembled a huge task force in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>, which has been at work more than one year. _ The <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> economy, which crashed with the oil-market collapse, remains sluggish, dashing dreams of a quick turnaround that would absorb many of the thrift problems. Should the economy dive again with a new crash in oil prices, the cost of the thrift cleanup would grow again. _ New owners of <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Ls have brought with them $ 1.1 billion in fresh capital, something regulators say is an accomplishment. But some economists say that's just a drop in the bucket, and not enough to return the state and the industry to solid footing. At the heart of the thrift crisis in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> is the bank board's often criticized `` Southwest Plan,'' which merges sick institutions into healthier ones rather than liquidating It was created with a premise that the government just could n't dump all the dead real estate in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> _ that it would have to wait for the economy to recover and absorb the vacant space Now it's almost a Catch-22 situation: The <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Ls need the economy to recover, but the economy remains sluggish because of the <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; L related problems, economists say. `` The ultimate question is how fast does <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> come back if it does come back,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Salomon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> real estate analyst <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Hopkins </PERSON>. The Lone Star state's battered economy has begun growing again slowly, but it's not keeping up with the rest of the nation. `` It's going to be awhile before we have growth consistent with the rest of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Gruben </PERSON>, a senior economist at the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>. Construction has come to a near standstill because of the oversupply of office buildings and homes. And banks and S & amp; Ls are hesitant to lend money these days to anyone but the safest of customers, making it tough for new businesses to get started. `` Lenders at virtually every financial institution are running scared,'' <PERSON> Sheshunoff </PERSON> said. `` The reality on the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> economy is that the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> economy is going to come back one job at a time.'' And if the economy does n't cooperate with the regulators, the cost for the <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; L cleanup will undoubtedly rise. `` If the economic environment deteriorates further, if the value of real estate, rather than coming back or stabilizing, goes down, or if interest rates go up dramatically, that cost will go up,'' <PERSON> Barclay </PERSON> said. How the S & amp; L crisis came about is a story of part crime and part circumstance. It was triggered by the downfall of the <LOCATION> Southwest </LOCATION> economy, but it was exaggerated by the high-flying antics of entrepreneurs, primarily in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, who, either through fraud, mismanagement or bad decisions, created billion-dollar messes. At the same time, regulators had only skeletal forces in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, and were n't keeping up. So widespread were S & amp; L shenanigans across <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> that the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> task force reportedly subpoenaed the records of hundreds of people. The task force, which occupies an entire floor of a federal building in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>, has grown to 58, including 25 <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents, said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Fishkin </PERSON>, an agent with the fraud section of <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. So far, 33 people have been indicted and 20 convicted. Four trials are pending. But the major players in what has been described as looting of thrifts, remain under investigation. `` These cases are complex and it takes a long time to accumulate evidence and put the cases together,'' <PERSON> Fishkin </PERSON> said. Meanwhile, regulators have beefed up their examination forces in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, both to prevent a recurrence of the disasters of the mid-80s, and watch over their Southwest Plan creations. In the last five years, the <LOCATION> Southwest </LOCATION> regional regulatory bank, which moved from <LOCATION> Little </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rock </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ark. </LOCATION>, to <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> in 1983, has grown from 92 examiners and supervisors with a $ 5 million budget to 450 professionals with a $ 33 million budget. This year, another 123 examiners and analysts will be added, <ORGANIZATION> Barclay </ORGANIZATION> said, with another $ 11.5 million for the budget. `` We see an awesome responsibility to make sure that the mergers we're putting together work,'' <PERSON> Barclay </PERSON> said. `` Everybody always learns from their experience. What happened here in'83,'84, and'85 when the regulatory process was n't up to snuff, wo n't happen again,'' <PERSON> Barclay </PERSON> said. `` If anything, we may even be overreacting.''

<HEAD>Credit Markets Preparing For Quarterly Auction</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By VIVIAN MARINO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> will be turning to the auction block again soon to peddle a barrage of new bonds and notes that will help support the government's growing national debt. This time around, Wall Street's largest brokers will be asked to buy $ 28.75 billion in new three - and 10-year notes and 30-year bonds They, in turn, will resell the securities to the public. Analysts said the auction plan outlined this past week was in line with market expectations. It's set to begin Tuesday and end Thursday. The only big difference between this auction and the previous two is that it includes the 30-year bond, which was on hiatus because <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> had failed to raise the ceiling on issuance of long-term debt. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> finally passed new legislation before it adjourned last year. While there were few surprises in the size of the upcoming sale, economists appeared divided on how well it might go in the wake of the latest economic data. Adding pressure to the credit markets was the government's January unemployment report, which pointed to continued strength in the economy along with the possibility of higher inflation The report, released Friday, showed that the nation's jobless rate inched up to 5.4 percent in January from 5.3 percent at the end of the year. But despite the slight increase, 408,000 new jobs were created last month, and that was far more than most economists had predicted. `` We believe the employment data is extremely negative,'' said <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>, director of money market research for <ORGANIZATION> Dean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Witter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reynolds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` It increases the pressures for the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> to tighten credit.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> has indicated repeatedly that it will push for higher interest rates to keep inflation in check, thereby making borrowing more expensive and slowing down economic growth. <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> and several other analysts predict that interest rates will be on the rise going into the upcoming auction. `` We do n't think the current yield level reflects the underlying fundamentals in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economy,'' he said. The upward slant in rates will put pressure on the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> to make the yields of its new bonds and notes high enough to attract domestic and foreign money. One saving grace, though, is the fact that the dollar has remained strong in foreign exchange. `` The foreign exchange market is definitely a plus for the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> auction,'' said <PERSON> Carol </PERSON> <PERSON> A </PERSON>. Stone, a senior economist for <ORGANIZATION> Nomura </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` I would say there will be good foreign participation.'' A rising dollar is seen as good news for foreigners because it means they are likely to earn more on their dollar-denominated investments. Proceeds of the upcoming <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> auction will be used toward raising about $ 13.7 billion in cash and redeeming $ 15.1 billion in old obligations, which make up part of the $ 2.8 trillion national debt. The sale will begin on Tuesday with $ 9.75 billion worth of three-year notes, followed by $ 9.5 billion in 10-year securities on Wednesday and $ 9.5 billion Thursday.

 Arguments over who pays the estimated $ 85 billion-plus tab for cauterizing the wounds of the nation's savings <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; loan industry are growing louder and angrier, with auditors criticizing regulators, depositors rebuking President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and his chief of staff chastising banks. By the end of the week the government was n't any closer to a solution to what everyone agrees will be the biggest federal bailout in history at a time the country can least afford it, given a budget deficit of $ 150 billion. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told congressional lawmakers any rescue plan `` will not be popular.'' The underlying acrimony in the crisis afflicting many of the nation's 3,000 <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Ls seemed to turn uglier with each passing day in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, where much of the feuding took place over how their rescue should be financed. The <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>, an investigative arm of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, told lawmakers that federal regulators were wrong to rush into a rash of deals late last year with promises of billions of dollars in assistance and guarantees to buyers of broke, badly managed savings <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; loan institutions. The <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> recommended the government seize all remaining insolvent S & amp; Ls to isolate them from the healthy part of the industry. In addition, <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> Comptroller General <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Bowsher </PERSON> released a report suggesting several accounting firms inexplicably failed to report staggering loan problems at troubled Southwestern thrifts, contributing to what some lawmakers called a massive coverup. At least one congressional critic of the government's handling of the crisis, Rep. <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON>, T-Texas, said he had asked the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> to explore taking unspecified civil action against the errant accountants. At the same time, the first notable <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> gaffe in his 2-week-old presidency _ suggesting <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; L deposits could be taxed to subsidize the bailout effort _ not only refused to die but snowballed into a serious political problem that raised new questions about his judgment. Some lawmakers said they were inundated with constituent mail denouncing the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> idea. Reports surfaced nationwide that depositors were withdrawing their money from both sick and healthy S & amp; Ls to avoid the risk of a tax. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s chief of staff <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON>, meanwhile, fired off his own critical barrage directed at the banking industry over advertisements run in three states that he said were designed to raise thrift-depositor doubts about the sanctity of their savings. He called the ads `` unequivocally irresponsible.'' The <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bankers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> lobby group rejected <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON>'s outrage over the ads, which ran in <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION>, where the <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; L crisis has been acutely felt The <ORGANIZATION> ABA </ORGANIZATION> countered that it has always maintained banks are more secure than S & amp; Ls and that history is bearing the claim out. `` It is a very sensitive issue for bankers who have been under siege for years now by some bankrupt savings and loans who are trying to compete with below-market rates,'' said <PERSON> Mary-Liz </PERSON> <PERSON> Meany </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> ABA </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman. In other business and economic news this past week: _ The government released reports that showed January unemployment rose slightly, while in December, factory orders surged, personal income and spending both climbed at the same rate and a key forecasting gauge jumped Analysts remained divided over whether the data evidenced a slowdown or higher inflation ahead. _ Market corruption crackdowns spread from <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> to other big cities targeted by a special <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> task force At the same time, <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> futures-exchange officials intensified a self-policing effort in the aftermath of an <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> bugging operation said to expose rampant fraud. _ More fallout hit <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> as a result of its agreement to plead guilty to securities fraud charges related to the <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON> <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON> insider trading scandal, this time from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> gambling authorities who moved to sever the firm's ties to the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> casino business <ORGANIZATION> Kidder </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peabody </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, another big firm that paid a big fine a few years ago because of the scandal and has been struggling since, was hit by a spate of resignations. _ <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> announced the indefinite shutdown of a plant in <LOCATION> Framingham </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, an indication the giant automaker is still trying to cut operations despite claims of a turnaround <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, meanwhile, announced an agreement to market <ORGANIZATION> Hyundai </ORGANIZATION> cars in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, becoming the last big <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> automaker to develop direct ties to a Korean counterpart.

<HEAD>Stocks Up, Inflation Fears Down</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHET CURRIER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A series of recent price increases suggests that one group of economy-watchers is worrying less, not more, about inflation. The prices in question are those of common stocks, up close to 15 percent on average over the last 2 -LCB- months. At their lows in mid-November, Wall Street was brimming with talk that economic growth was straining the capacity of the nation's factories and labor force The resulting inflationary pressures, it was said, would push interest rates sharply higher and set the economy on a course toward recession. Since then, however, money managers at investing institutions seem to have reassessed the inflation outlook, bidding stocks up to levels not seen since before Black Monday on Oct. 19, 1987. A good many observers, including Chairman <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, have warned lately that inflation remains a threat. But as people make their investment decisions these days, they appear to be operating more and more on the assumption that the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> will keep inflation in check without stifling the business expansion. That thinking is evident in the behavior of long-term interest rates in the bond market, which have actually declined a bit even as the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> has tightened credit and short-term interest rates have moved up. `` The bullish sentiment in the bond market in January has partly reflected the viewpoint that short-term rates will not have to rise much higher and for a prolonged period in order for the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> to contain inflation,'' said <PERSON> Maury </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>, economist at <ORGANIZATION> PaineWebber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. Similarly, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Resler </PERSON> at <ORGANIZATION> Nomura </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, observed, `` Through word and deed, Mr. <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> has proven his commitment to hold inflation in check. `` We suspect that the principal reason for these rather euphoric markets is the growing belief that discipline will govern both monetary and budgetary policies during the year -LRB- and, perhaps, years -RRB- ahead.'' In the past week, the Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 8.39 to 2,331.25, posting its fifth straight weekly gain since the start of 1989. The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> composite index gained 1.72 to 166.50; the <ORGANIZATION> NASDAQ </ORGANIZATION> composite index for the over-the-counter market added 8.39 to 406.35, and the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> market value index was up 3.31 at 324.88. Volume on the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> averaged 186.79 million shares a day, against 196.40 million the week before. Fears that rapid employment growth might soon touch off inflationary forces in the form of accelerating wage increases have by no means been dispelled altogether. For some analysts, those worries were in fact heightened on Friday when the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> reported that payroll employment increased by a larger-than-expected 408,000 jobs in January. `` Full employment is imminent. So is sharply higher inflation,'' asserted <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Lieberman </PERSON>, director of financial markets research at <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hanover </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, in a report published this past week. `` The pool of unemployed is sufficiently depleted that only about 800,000 to 900,000 more workers can be hired without unusual wage inducements.'' But <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Yardeni </PERSON>, economist at <ORGANIZATION> Prudential-Bache </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION>, argues that low unemployment need not be an inflationary force. `` We believe that labor shortages will induce business, particularly in the services sector, to boost productivity,'' <PERSON> Yardeni </PERSON> says. `` If so, then low unemployment rates, in effect, will boost our national productivity, which should reduce inflationary pressures. `` During the 1970s, we experienced high unemployment and high inflation. In the 1990s, we should experience low unemployment and low inflation.''

<HEAD>Eds: For Saturday PMs</HEAD>

 The financial markets showed little movement despite indications the economy is expanding at a fairly strong rate with employment levels, factory orders and auto sales all rising. On Wall Street, stock prices finished little changed Friday as the Dow Jones average of 30 industrials slipped 2.50 to 2,331.25. The dollar closed little changed against most currencies and bond prices posted some modest losses. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration assured <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> allies of the president's commitment to lowering the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> budget deficit but the participants said they reached no agreement on a new approach to the troubling issue of Third World debt. The two days of meetings of finance ministers and central bank presidents from <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> ended with officials projecting an upbeat view of the world economy despite the continuing debt problem and the fact that trade imbalances have begun widening again. The <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said non-farm payrolls rose by 408,000 jobs in January, well above market expectations. The strong job growth overshadowed the announcement that the unemployment rate rose 0.1 percentage point to 5.4 percent in January. Analysts said the economy may be growing too quickly and predicted the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> would move to rein it in. `` It's a much stronger report than we thought,'' said <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> <PERSON> Wyss </PERSON>, chief economist at <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> Lexington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, forecasting firm. `` It suggests we are going into the first quarter a lot stronger than we thought. The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> is going to tighten and short-term interest rates will be going up.'' Some predicted that action will come next week, when the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Open </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Market </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> meets to set 1989 targets for growth in the money supply. Tight growth restrictions act as a brake on economic growth by pushing interest rates upward. In another report, the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said factory orders shot up 4.1 percent in December. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said orders for durable and non-durable manufactured goods reached a seasonally adjusted total of $ 237.6 billion in December after rising 0.5 percent in November and 2.0 percent in October. The nation's automakers, meanwhile, reported that sales of U.S.-made cars and light trucks rose 5.6 percent in late January. The automakers reported they sold cars and light trucks at a daily rate of 41,798 vehicles during the Jan. 21-31 period this year, compared with a rate of 39,571 during the same period a year ago. Car sales were up 5.3 percent, led by a 14.8 percent increase by <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, and truck sales rose 6.3 percent during the period. <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s U.S.-made car sales rose 2.1 percent while <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s fell 11.9 percent in late January compared with the same period last year.
