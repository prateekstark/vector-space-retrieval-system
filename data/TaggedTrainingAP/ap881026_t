<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> will recommend that the almost-complete <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> be destroyed and rebuilt because of fears it contains sophisticated eavesdropping devices, <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> reported in its Thursday editions. The newspaper quoted <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> sources as saying the president's decision was expected to be announced Thursday. It probably would cost $ 300 million and take five years to build a new eight-story embassy on the same site with materials imported from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and kept under heavy guard after they arrived in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, the paper reported. <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> sources have said that Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> recommended the move to <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration believes the embassy building, which was mostly completed by 1985, includes structural elements riddled with sophisticated devices that were intended for eavesdropping. However, details on those findings have not been released. The current plan, the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> reported, is to fabricate the building's main elements in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, ship them to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, keep them under heavy guard and have the building assembled by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> workers taken to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> for the construction project. The embassy building originally was to have been completed by 1983. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s recommendation would be made to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, and officials said they believed lawmakers would insist on a full study of the matter. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has adjourned for the year. <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials said that while the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> embassy is being constructed, Soviet officials in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> will be barred from occupying their long-completed embassy office building.

 The future is bleak for many children in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s cities unless the next president and <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> make a commitment to solving some of their problems, a <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> mayor said Wednesday. `` Too many children in our cities have no future, no future at all unless we, as a nation, act on the problems they face today,'' said <PERSON> Theodore </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mann </PERSON>, mayor of <LOCATION> Newton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Mann </PERSON> is chairman of the human development committee of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mayors </ORGANIZATION>, which on Wednesday released `` A Status Report on Children in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s Cities.'' The report `` calls attention to our collective failure as a nation to respond to these problems'' <PERSON> Mann </PERSON> said of the 52-city survey of mayors and human service officials. The study identifies drug abuse, weaknesses in education systems, the lack of affordable child care, teen-age pregnancy and school dropouts as key problems which have grown worse in the last five years in 80 percent of the cities surveyed. Officials said low-income children are confronted with the additional problems of homelessness and the lack of access to medical and mental health care. <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Moriarity </PERSON>, director of human services for <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, recounted some of the survey's gloomier statistics: three of 10 children in the cities surveyed lived in poverty in 1986; one in five was on welfare and received food stamps; 38 percent dropped out of school between the ninth grade and their scheduled high school graduation in the class of 1988; 15 percent of the babies born in 1986 were born to teen-age mothers; and a 12.6 percent infant mortality rate plagued the cities during that year. Among survey cities <LOCATION> Irvine </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, had the lowest overall poverty rate and child poverty rate in 1986 at 4.1 percent and 3.3 percent, respectively. The city with the highest 1986 overall poverty rate and child poverty rate was <LOCATION> Camden </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, at 42.3 percent and 61.1 percent, respectively. Meanwhile, the <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> released a study, based on 1979 data, that showed that 17.1 percent of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> children lived in families with income below the poverty level. The poverty rate for children was 5.1 percent in <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION> and 8.2 percent in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> study said the high <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> poverty rate among children occurs because programs for the poor cover fewer people and provide fewer benefits than programs in other industrialized countries. Officials said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>' relative standing had changed little, if any, since 1979. <PERSON> Mann </PERSON> said the mayors' conference was not interested in placing blame for the current problems but was calling for a national partnership between the business community and federal, state and local governments. However most speakers at Wednesday's session of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> Officials, an affiliate of the mayors' conference, emphasized increasing the federal government's role, both financially and in providing policy direction `` We've got to have more federal assistance, not just in funding but in policy,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Moran </PERSON>, mayor of <LOCATION> Alexandria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION> `` We feel that we have done as much as we can and sometimes more,'' <PERSON> Moran </PERSON> said. `` We are losing middle-class residents because of high property taxes'' used to pay for needed services he said. <PERSON> Moran </PERSON> said his community, a prosperous suburb of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, faces a growing problem of homelessness fueled by a high dropout rate. He cited an 18.6 percent dropout rate in 1987 among teen-age girls due to pregnancy. Among the cities surveyed, <LOCATION> Norfolk </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, had the highest dropout rate in the class of 1988. Seventy-one percent of <LOCATION> Norfolk </LOCATION>'s 1988 class left school from the ninth grade and 37 percent of the rest of those eligible for graduation in 1988 left in the tenth grade. But <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Raiss </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <LOCATION> Norfolk </LOCATION> public schools, called the group's numbers `` completely erroneous.'' The study did not take into account <LOCATION> Norfolk </LOCATION>'s transient population _ the city is home to the world's largest naval facility _ and the study counted as dropouts students who actually transferred from one school to another, who transferred out of the district and those who were not promoted for academic reasons, among others. According to figures supplied to the state of <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Norfolk </LOCATION> had a dropout rate of 8.1 percent in 1988, which was down from 9.1 percent in 1987 and 15.8 percent in 1981. The average wait for subsidized child care among surveyed cities was almost 10 months, while the wait for non-subsidized child care was 18 weeks, with costs running an average of $ 78 weekly at a center-based facility. Nationally, half the children under 6 have mothers who work outside the home. The group did not identify a specific amount they thought was needed from the federal government to address children's problems but <PERSON> Mann </PERSON> noted that both presidential candidates had emphasized children's issues in their campaigns. `` We need to hear more from each of them on a commitment of dollars. We need to hear that they are willing to make the enormous investment that the problems demand, and the children deserve,'' <PERSON> Mann </PERSON> added.

 Two whales trapped for nearly three weeks in the arctic ice pack were freed Wednesday by Soviet and American icebreakers, superpower saviors who hacked a path to the open sea. `` The whales are loose and in the channel and headed out,'' said Lt. <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Haller </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Alaska </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION>. `` They looked good all afternoon. To look at them, you'd have thought they had their bags packed and were ready to head south.'' `` They're in the main lead, and I ca n't help but think they'll keep on truckin' I do n't know how much more we can do,'' said rescue coordinator <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oceanic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atmospheric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>. The work to free the migrating <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> gray whales progressed rapidly Tuesday when two Soviet ice-breaking vessels began smashing the ice that kept the pair imprisoned. A third trapped whale is believed to have died last week. <PERSON> Morris </PERSON>, who followed the whales by helicopter, landed a little after 4 p.m. -LRB- 9 p.m. EDT -RRB- to report that the whales had moved from the final man-made breathing hole to the slushy path the Soviet icebreaker <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> Arseniev </PERSON> cut Tuesday night. Rescue officials were worried that the whales would have trouble breaking air holes through the partly frozen cut, but around 4:30 p.m. rescue workers found the two whales had opened a small breathing hole and were sharing it. One of the whales was bleeding enough to stain the water red. Spectators watched anxiously for several moments, waiting for the whales to surface in the new waterway cut Wednesday by the Arseniev _ and cheered joyously when the whales broke the surface. As darkness fell, the whales were swimming back and forth in the channel. Officials halted helicopter surveillance at nightfall, but said they planned to meet Thursday and could check whether the whales had reached the sea. The Arseniev stayed in the channel Wednesday night, widening the passage to the open sea, officials said. Scientists and others involved in the rescue may never know the whales' fate. `` A lot of people really did n't want to know,'' said <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON>, a federal marine biologist, after officials decided not to put electronic tracking tags on the already stressed animals. <PERSON> Haller </PERSON> said plans were being made in <LOCATION> Barrow </LOCATION> to thank the Soviets with a party, but Soviet officers said they would wait until it was clear the whales were in the open sea before celebrating. Before the whales were freed, as the Soviet icebreakers drew near, the whales were `` acting in a very excited manner, almost like they can sense freedom,'' said Sgt. <PERSON> Ian </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> Alaska </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> spokesman. By midday, the Soviet icebreakers were a quarter-mile from the line of breathing holes being cut by Americans working in the opposite direction, he said. Later Wednesday, rescuers began to use a gargantuan, tractor-like device propelled by pontoon augers to clear the ice cut by the icebreaker, <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> said. The breakthrough in the effort to free the migrating gray whales caught in an early freeze came after more than a week of delays and disappointments. `` We feel very good about it,'' said Rear Adm. <PERSON> Sigmund </PERSON> <PERSON> Petersen </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> NOAA </ORGANIZATION>. `` The cooperation has just been fantastic. The Soviets came in here with a very positive attitude and went to work immediately.'' On Tuesday, the Americans moved the huge mammals around a shoal that had stymied progress for three days. Eskimos with chain saws cut a detour in the ice so the whales could swim around the shallow water they had refused to pass. When the Eskimos started cutting the air holes, the whales `` followed the water right to the end. They like that deeper water,'' <PERSON> Petersen </PERSON> said. Working in the other direction, the Soviet icebreakers reduced to rubble the ice ridge standing between the whales and open water. The ridge, formed by colliding ice masses, was a jumble of ice blocks as big as small houses. `` The whales seemed to be doing fine,'' <PERSON> Petersen </PERSON> said. `` It's like they expected something to be happening Everything seems to be coming together.'' The whales, which normally migrate to the <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> coast in the winter, were discovered off <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>'s northern coast three weeks ago, the ice closing in around them and leaving them only a few small breathing holes. The whales could not swim the four miles to open water without surfacing for air. A third whale disappeared Friday and is believed dead. The icebreakers _ the Admiral <PERSON> Makarov </PERSON> and the <LOCATION> Arseniev </LOCATION> _ began working shortly after their arrival Tuesday, flying the flags of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> as a sign of cooperation between the nations. The ships had been returning to their home port of <LOCATION> Vladivostok </LOCATION> when they were diverted, said <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Patzevich </PERSON>, chief officer and second in command. Although the Admiral <PERSON> Makarov </PERSON> has been at sea for six months and `` everybody is tired,'' none of the crew of 78 has complained about the diversion, <PERSON> Patzevich </PERSON> said. `` It's very nice to work together,'' he said of the U.S.-Soviet effort. First Mate <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> Moroz </PERSON>, who said he was the ship's political officer, said the Soviets were happy to help. He said he spoke to a <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> newspaper by telephone. `` They're receiving many, many calls asking about the whales,'' he said. `` Our country is watching like everyone else. We love animals, just as everyone.'' The population of endangered <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> gray whales has risen to about 20,000, growing at an annual average of 2.5 percent for the past decade, officials said. The whales have one of the longest migration routes of all the mammals, some 6,000 to 8,000 miles from the <LOCATION> Arctic </LOCATION> to the warm water off <LOCATION> Baja </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. `` The human persistence and determination by so many individuals on behalf of these whales shows mankind's concern for the environment,'' President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said from the White House. `` It has been an inspiring endeavor.''

 Two national polls have found <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> consolidating his lead in the presidential race, with fewer voters saying they may change their minds _ although many remain dissatisfied with their choices. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> held double-digit leads in the <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News-New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> and Gallup polls released Tuesday, further evidence of a surge for the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> nominee since his debate with Democrat <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> on Oct. 13. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> led <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> by 13 points among probable voters in the <ORGANIZATION> CBS-Times </ORGANIZATION> poll, 54-41 percent, and by 50-40 among registered voters in Gallup's poll. He led by 14 points among Gallup respondents judged likely to vote. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had led by a consistent but narrow margin _ four to seven points in most polls _ since late August. But the numbers started to move in his favor last week, and the new results continued that trend. In one key finding, the CBS-Times poll found clear success in <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s attacks on <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> on crime. Sixty-two percent said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was tough enough in dealing with crime and criminals; just 37 percent said the same of <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. In another, 25 percent said the political commercials they had seen helped them decide whom to support, and more than half of that group went for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. Still, 62 percent said commercials had not helped them decide. The polls found dissatisfaction with both nominees. In the <ORGANIZATION> CBS-Times </ORGANIZATION> poll, 64 percent wished they had other choices than <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. And just 42 percent of Gallup's respondents had a strong preference, compared with about 60 percent at this stage in the 1984 election. The surveys nonetheless found voters more firm in their decisions. In Gallup's, 28 percent said they were undecided or could change their minds _ down from 37 percent before the debate. In the <ORGANIZATION> CBS-Times </ORGANIZATION> poll, 74 percent said their minds were made up, compared with 66 percent earlier. As in other polls, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> received disproportionate support from men. They favored him by 54 percent to 38 percent in the Gallup poll, while women backed him by a far tighter 46 percent to 42 percent margin. The poll demonstrated that voter choices were based on the top of the ticket: The Democrats trailed even though <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' running mate, Sen. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, was rated far more favorably than was <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s, Sen. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> was viewed favorably by 59 percent, unfavorably by 27 percent; for <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> it was 42-44. Fifty-nine percent in the Gallup poll said they had a favorable opinion of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, to 35 percent unfavorable. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> did less well _ 50 percent favorable, 43 percent unfavorable. The small remainders did n't answer. The leads in the two polls were less than the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> advantage in the first full-sized survey conducted after the Oct. 13 debate, an <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News-Wall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Street </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION> poll that found him ahead by 17 points. No other poll has found a <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> lead that great. It was followed by <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News-Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> polls that found sizable but smaller <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> leads _ seven and nine points respectively. Last weekend a <ORGANIZATION> Newsweek </ORGANIZATION> poll, done by Gallup, put the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> advantage at nine points, 50-41. The new Gallup poll released Tuesday was conducted Friday through Sunday among 1,232 registered voters and had margin of sampling error of plus or minus three points. Of the total, 815 were considered to be likely voters; the result among that group had a four-point error margin. The CBS-Times poll was conducted Friday through Monday among 1,287 probable voters and had a three-point error margin. Meanwhile, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> took a slight lead over <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> in a statewide poll in <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, which was long thought to be safe territory for the Democrat from nearby <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>. The poll, conducted by <ORGANIZATION> Joseph </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fleming </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION> for WPRI-TV, found <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> with 46 percent support, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> with 41 percent and 13 percent not sure. The survey of 414 registered voters was conducted last week and had a nearly five-point margin of error, meaning the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> lead is just large enough to be statistically significant. In the Democratic stronghold of <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> led <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> 51 percent to 42 percent, <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> reported in today's editions The Post survey of 601 likely voters was conducted Tuesday through Saturday and had a margin of error of four percentage points.

<TEXT>
 When presidential campaigns enter their closing days, it's a good bet the candidate denouncing the negative tactics of his opponent is running behind. The first candidate to demand the opposition stop lying about his record is probably in trouble. The Democrat who turns to populism is trying to turn the tide. The Republican who warns against big spending is trying to do the same. That is the pattern of campaigns past and present. Sometimes it works. Echoes of those closing arguments are being heard as the 1988 presidential campaign winds down. `` Full of lies and he knows it,'' says a new <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> ad denouncing the negative campaign tactics of <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. The television spot closes with this dose of populism: `` The real question is will we have a president who fights for the privileged few, or will we have a president who fights for you.'' The <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> commercial was not the first time a candidate who felt he was losing to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> accused the vice president of distorting his record. One of the more memorable moments of the campaign for the Republican presidential nomination was the night of the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> primary. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, whose dream of winning the nomination had been shaken by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> victory, was asked if there was anything he wanted to say to the vice president. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> glared at the camera and snapped, `` Yeah, tell him to stop lying about my record.'' It was all downhill from there for the Kansan who thought he could have won in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> if the oppposition had n't portrayed him as soft on tax increases. But the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> attacks probably harmed <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> less in the long run than his demand that they stop. The senator's demeanor during that televised instant resurrected memories of his ill-fated run as the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> vice presidential nominee in 1976, a race he later would admit did not serve him well. <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Truman </PERSON> wrote the book on how to upset a favored Republican opponent with a strong dose of populist rhetoric. `` I'm going to fight hard,'' <PERSON> Truman </PERSON> recalled telling his running mate, <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Alben </PERSON> <PERSON> Barkley </PERSON>. `` I'm going to give them hell.'' <PERSON> Truman </PERSON> set the tone at his opening rally on Labor Day. `` If in this next election you get a <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and an administration friendly to labor you have much to hope for,'' he told a rally made up largely of union members. `` If you get a <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and an administration unfriendly to labor you have much to fear.'' <PERSON> Hubert </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON> tried the same sort of populist appeal in the closing weeks of the 1968 presidential campaign against <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>. The Minnesotan succeeded in bringing many Democrats back to the fold and the election turned out much closer than anybody had predicted. But <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON> fell 510,000 votes short of overtaking <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>. Or this: `` He has campaigned with negativism, failing the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people by refusing to lay out for them worthwhile programs in major fields which for two months I have been discussing in frankness and detail.'' That appeal sounds a little like the theme <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> now is sounding. But it was used by <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> in 1960 and directed at <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>. <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> said <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> `` advocates a Niagara of spending which would in the end either raise their taxes or prices and would cheapen their insurance policies, pensions and Social Security.'' `` I've got news for those Republicans, we're going to be the ones celebrating on election night,'' is a favorite <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign line. `` The pollsters and the Republicans are in for the biggest surprise of their lives,'' said <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mondale </PERSON>, the day before he lost 49 states. In the closing days of the 1976 campaign, President <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ford </PERSON> said, `` I think we are neck and neck and when you have momentum and the opposition is trying to put its finger in every dike to try and stop the erosion, obviously we have the momentum going and they are frantic, frustrated and frenzied. `` And, gee, I just feel good about it, just wonderful.'' <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> did have momentum at that stage of the campaign, but not enough to overtake Democrat <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>.

 Incumbents in the nation's <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> races have rolled to a 3-to-1 advantage over challengers in fund raising this year, underlining the need for campaign finance reform, says the lobbying group Common Cause. Senators seeking re-election collected $ 102 million to finance their campaigns as of Sept. 30, compared with just $ 38 million for challengers, according to the group's analysis of reports submitted to the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Election </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. The analysis showed that one of four dollars flowing to contenders in the nation's 33 <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> races comes from special-interest groups, and incumbents enjoyed a 5-to-1 edge in receipts from the political action committees, or PACs. `` Special-interst PACs are money machines for incumbents,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Common </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cause </ORGANIZATION> president <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Wertheimer </PERSON> in a statement. `` The congressional campaign finance system is patently unfair to challengers.'' The self-styled citizens lobby has been waging an uphill fight for years to restrict PAC giving to campaigns and to impose overall spending limits to give incumbents less of a lock on a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> or <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> seat. Campaign finance reform is expected to be near the top of the list of legislative priorities when the 101st <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> convenes in January. <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> candidates had raised $ 161.7 million by Sept. 30, according to the analysis. Nearly $ 39 million of that came from PACs. Their financial edge enabled incumbents to spend $ 2 for every dollar spent by challenges, on average, and still go into the final month of the campaign with a huge cash advantage. Cash on hand for the 27 incumbents totaled $ 33.3 million as of Sept. 30, compared with just $ 7.3 million for their opponents. On average, incumbents raised $ 3.7 million each while challengers averaged $ 1.4 million each, the study found. In the six races where there is no incumbent seeking re-election _ <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION> _ contenders have raised a total of $ 21.4 million, $ 4.7 million of it from PACs, a slightly greater proportion than in the other contests. The top fund-raiser overall, according to the study, is incumbent Sen. <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, R-Calif. <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> had collected $ 12.5 million toward his re-election bid, and also topped the spending list with $ 9.8 million in expenditures <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> is one of the most expensive media states in which to mount a campaign. <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>'s opponent, Democratic Lt. Gov. <PERSON> Leo </PERSON> <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON>, had raised $ 5.4 million and spent $ 3.4 million on his challenge. The largest recipient of PAC money was Sen. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, who is waging dual campaigns for re-election to his <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> seat and as <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> vice presidential candidate. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, also chairman of the tax-writing <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, pulled in $ 2.3 million from special-interest groups. <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> ranked second on that list, with $ 2 million.

<HEAD>Panel Opposes Plan To Put Nuclear Reactor Into Storage</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The operator of the contaminated <LOCATION> Three </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mile </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> nuclear plant hopes to mothball the reactor next year, but a panel of citizens and scientists says more commitments to clean up the site are needed first. A spokesman for the <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> plant's operator said Tuesday that managers hoped to go ahead with the plan to place the crippled Unit 2 reactor into `` monitored storage'' by the end of 1989. Next year will mark the 10th anniversary of the nation's worst commercial nuclear accident at Three Mile Island on March 31, 1979. The storage plan calls for the reactor building to be locked up and unneeded systems deactivated. The plant would sit for perhaps 30 years while radiation decays inside. Although the damaged nuclear fuel and loose radioactive components would have been removed from the plant, radiation would remain in piping and other areas of the reactor building basement. The Advisory Panel for the Decontamination of Unit 2 told the <ORGANIZATION> Nuclear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regulatory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> during a meeting Tuesday that nine of its 11 members had sided against the so-called `` Post Defueling Monitored Storage plan,'' which is known as PDMS. <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Morris </PERSON>, the panel chairman and the mayor of <LOCATION> Lancaster </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, said many in the group felt the plan was too vague. He said the panel believed the cleanup `` should proceed expeditiously.'' With no specific funding in place, <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> said there were concerns that the cleanup of the plant might not be completed, even after the storage phase ended. In addition, he said area residents were troubled by the uncertainty of not knowing exactly how many years the reactor would sit idle until it was decommissioned. `` The utility seems to have looked at this PDMS as a given, and sort of expected us to go along with it,'' said panel member <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> <PERSON> Roth </PERSON>. In the 1979 accident, Unit 2 was allowed to lose vital cooling water that normally covers it. The subsequent $ 1 billion cleanup has focused on water decontamination, waste shipment and removal of fuel from the damaged core. <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> <PERSON> Bedell </PERSON>, a spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> GPU </ORGANIZATION> Nuclear, the plant operator, said in an interview after Tuesday's meeting that the cleanup would likely stop at the end of next year. He said it was pointless to expose cleanup workers to additional risk after that because remaining radiation would be `` fixed in place,'' presenting no threat to the public. He said the utility envisioned letting Unit 2 sit idle until after its twin, Unit 1, ended its service life in about the year 2010. Then, both units would be dismantled together. <ORGANIZATION> GPU </ORGANIZATION> Nuclear would need an amendment to its Nuclear Regulatory Commission license before it could proceed with its storage plan. The decision on whether to grant the change would be made by the <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> staff, although it is possible the commissioners themselves would get involved.

 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has banned most Nicaraguan government officials from entering the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in the latest round of a tit-for-tat diplomatic feud. Under a proclamation released Tuesday by the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> declared `` the unrestricted ... entry of officers and employees of the Nicaraguan government and the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinista </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> ... to be detrimental to the interests of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.'' The prohibition applies to all Nicaraguan government and party officials with the exception of those carrying out activities related to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> or other international organizations. Family members of such officials are exempted as well. The diplomatic tussle began on July 11, when <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION> expelled <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Melton </PERSON> and seven other <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> officials on grounds they interfered in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s internal affairs. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> retaliated the next day by expelling Nicaraguan Ambassador <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Tunnermann </PERSON> and seven of his colleagues. Since then, the Sandinista government has not acted on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attempts to replace the expelled <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> envoys. `` We've been trying to get our people replaced, and we have n't gotten anywhere,'' <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Roman </PERSON> <PERSON> Popadiuk </PERSON> said A call placed to the Nicaraguan Embassy seeking comment was not returned. The president's action also comes in light of a new restriction placed on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> last month. On Sept. 22, the Sandinista government imposed the new requirement that <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> diplomats based in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> who leave the country, for whatever reason, must wait at least three weeks before they may return. The dispute was aggravated last month when the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration refused to allow <LOCATION> Nicaraguan </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> to bring a delegation of 60 Nicaraguans on a proposed visit to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> and to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said the Nicaraguans applied too late for their visas, a claim the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> denied. <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> canceled the trip.

<HEAD>Builders Say No Insulation Changes Needed to Combat Radon</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Builders </ORGANIZATION> says it wo n't recommend any changes in insulation practices to combat the buildup of radon, which government officials say is probably the second-ranking cause of lung cancer. At a news conference Tuesday, an official with the association said it is telling its members to continue employing `` the same practices we have recommended for years for energy conservation.'' <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Spears </PERSON>, program manager at the association's national research center, said, `` We've found that energy conservation has little to do with radon concentration in the house.'' <PERSON> Spears </PERSON>' conclusion `` tracks with our preliminary results over the past few years for both new homes and existing homes,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Rice </PERSON>. EPA is engaged in a cooperative research program with the center. But <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> says increased ventilation still may be useful in reducing radon buildup in particular homes. Last month <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> advised that everyone living on a second floor or below should have indoor air tested for radon. The <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> issued a `` health advisory,'' elevating indoor radon to the same status as smoking as a health threat. <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> believes radon ranks second only to smoking as a cause of lung cancer. Of the 130,000 annual deaths from lung cancer, about 85 percent are caused by smoking. <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> estimates radon could cause as many as 20,000 deaths, which if true would be roughly all those not caused by smoking. Radon is a radioactive gas emitted in some degree by all soils. It quickly decays into other substances, but its decay products are also radioactive and can lodge in the lung, irradiating the tissue for a lifetime. Indoor dust and smoke, and smoke from tobacco products, can carry these decay products into the lung. There are many techniques for reducing radon buildup, often the same techniques that are used to keep water out of basements such as careful sealing of joints, use of tight covers on sumps and a thick polyethylene barrier between the slab and the ground. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ethier </PERSON>, litigation counsel for the association, said members were being advised that `` if they make a reasoned judgment that there may be high radon levels,'' they should `` rough in'' mitigation techniques such as under-slab ventilation pipes that may be ignored later if appropriate, or connected to a fan to divert radon-laden air around the basement. In states such as <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> with well-publicized instances of radon buildup, <PERSON> Ethier </PERSON> said he has found `` universal'' adoption of such precautions by builders. Builders report that the techniques may add as little as $ 100 to the cost of a home, if water barriers are already being used, but as much as $ 600 if they are not, he said.

<HEAD>New Cancer Drug Released, 87 New Cardiovascular Drugs Studied</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 New drugs in the medical war against cancer and cardiovascular disease are now available or on the way. <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> announced Tuesday that a new drug to treat the crippling effects of intestinal cancer can now be marketed in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. In addition, the <ORGANIZATION> Pharmaceutical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> said 47 companies are now working on a total of 87 new drugs to treat the cardiovascular diseases of high blood pressure, stroke and heart disease. The new cancer drug is a protein compound called octreotide acetate that is designed to stop the severe, unrelenting diarrhea that often takes the lives of patients suffering from intestinal cancer. <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> Commissioner <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON> said the new drug `` can dramatically improve life for these cancer patients, permitting many to pursue their normal lives for years, rather than be weakened and continually hospitalized.'' The new drug, marketed by <ORGANIZATION> Sandoz </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pharmaceuticals </ORGANIZATION> under the brand name <PERSON> Sandostatin </PERSON>, does not actually attack the cancer itself. Instead, it blocks production of a peptide that causes the diarrhea. <PERSON> Young </PERSON> said patients with malignant carcinoid tumors and vasoactive intestinal peptide-secreting tumors often can live 15 to 20 years before dying as a direct result of the slow-growing cancer. But because the cancer forces the secretion of peptides that cause the severe diarrhea, patients usually die sooner. <PERSON> Sandostatin </PERSON> prevents the diarrhea by blocking the secretion of the peptides. The drug does this by imitating the action of somatostatin, a natural hormone that regulates secretions from the body's organs. The drug is administered by injection. The <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> said the cancer is diagnosed in one to two people per million annually. <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mossinghoff </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Pharmaceutical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, said a survey of the association members indicates there are 87 new drugs for cardiovascular disease treatment now in clinical trials or awaiting final <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> approval. `` No other disease is targeted by so many drugs in development or so much investment in research,'' said <PERSON> Mossinghoff </PERSON>. He acknowledged at a news conference that one of the reasons the companies are pouring so much investment into cardiovascular diseases is that there remains a huge market for such therapies even though doctors now realize they are among the most preventable illnesses for people who adopt healthy lifestyles in their early and middle years. Dr. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Beary </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, senior vice president for science and technology for the trade association, noted that heart disease remains the nation's No. 1 killer and stroke No. 3. Even though the population is generally healthier, as well as older, than in years past, <PERSON> Beary </PERSON> said, `` at some point these diseases catch up with everyone.'' The pharmaceutical trade group's survey of its more than 100 members was designed to provide an overview of the scope of new drug development in various categories, rather than highlight any particularly promising `` breakthrough'' drugs. The trade association plans similar surveys in December for cancer drugs under development and in January for arthritis, Alzheimer's and other diseases of the aging. The cardiovascular disease survey found more medicines being developed for hypertension, or high blood pressure, than any other condition with all but three of the 38 drugs in that category in the final stages of testing. The pharmaceutical association said the second largest category, with 28 drugs under development, is congestive heart failure.

<HEAD>Investigators Blame Pilot For AVAir Crash</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A commuter airliner crash last February that killed all 12 people on board was caused mainly by an excessively rapid turn after the aircraft took off from <LOCATION> Raleigh-Durham </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, airport, federal investigators say. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday blamed pilot error for the AVAir crash, but it said contributing factors were the commuter line's failure to act when it received information the pilot had previous flying problems and the government's inadequate monitoring of the airline, which had financial problems. The AVAir plane, flying as <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eagle </ORGANIZATION> Flight 378, crashed shortly after it took off in dense fog on Feb. 19, l988, landing in wooded area about a mile from the airport runway. The Fairchild Metro III commuter was bound for <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, with 10 passengers, a pilot and a copilot. The <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION> criticized the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> for not keeping a closer watch on AVAir's financial problems during a period of rapid expansion and not forwarding such information to the inspectors assigned to the airline. AVAir had undergone rapid growth in 1987 as a feeder for <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Raleigh-Durham </LOCATION>. It was ranked the 30th largest commuter airline in the country last year carrying 351,522 passengers but met hard times in late l987. It filed for bankruptcy last January, resumed operation in February but sold its commuter operation to <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> in May. The <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION> said the probable cause for the Feb. 19 accident was `` the failure of the flight crew to maintain a proper flight path due to the first officer's inappropriate instrument scan, the captain's inadequate monitoring of the flight and the flight crew's response to a fault in the airplane's stall avoidance system. The investigation revealed that the copilot, <PERSON> Kathleen </PERSON> <PERSON> Digan </PERSON>, 28, who had been hired by AVAir in May 1987, had a spotty flying record and on a number of occasions had been the subject of critical evaluations by various AVAir captains. In July 1987 an AVAir captain wrote the airline's operations chief on hotel stationery that Ms. <PERSON> Digan </PERSON> had trouble on eight of 10 landings she flew during their trip together and that he considered her performance `` unacceptable.'' Two months later another AVAir captain reported in an evaluation that Ms. <PERSON> Digan </PERSON> had problems in clmb, cruise, descent and landing maneuvers. According to the <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION>, she was hired by AVAir, on March 5, 1987, when the airline needed scores of new pilots because of expansion plans. Ms. <PERSON> Digan </PERSON> was one of 123 pilots hired by AVAir in the second quarter of l987, according to the safety board. Ms. <PERSON> Digan </PERSON> had 2,080 hours of flying including a total of 450 hours on a Fairchild Metro II and Metro III at the time of the accident. Investigators determined that Ms. <PERSON> Digan </PERSON> was at the controls when the <ORGANIZATION> Metro </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> III </ORGANIZATION> commuter plane departed <LOCATION> Raleigh-Durham </LOCATION> on Feb. 19, although there was evidence that the captain, <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Cole </PERSON>, 38, attempted to help keep the aircraft aloft in the final seconds. The flight was the first she had flown in instrument conditions in 4 -LCB- weeks, the report said. Flight 378 had been told by air traffic control to bank to the right as soon as possible after takeoff because of the heavy traffic loads at the time of the departure, investigators said. But Ms. <PERSON> Digan </PERSON>, flying in foggy conditions, banked the aircraft at only 200 feet and at a 40 degree angle, almost twice as sharp as would have been prudent, and likely became somewhat disoriented, allowing the plane to descend, the safety board said. The pilots were relying on instruments because of the poor visibility and the <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION> concluded that if the pilots had scanned their instruments adequately they would have known the bank was too sharp and at too low an altitude. The <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION> report said the pilots also might have been distracted by a light indicating that the aircraft's stall warning system had activated. The system automatically forces the nose down if the aircraft is approaching a stall. According to the investigation, the aircraft's performance indicated that the stall warning system actually had not deployed, and the problem stemmed from a false warning light.

<HEAD>Senators Already Trying to Protect Home-District Bases</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The ink was barely dry on the military base-closing law signed by President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> this week when 17 senators began trying to make sure their home-district bases are spared at the expense of others. The senators, from Northeastern and <LOCATION> Midwestern </LOCATION> states, claimed that the Sunbelt region has a disproportionate share of military installations and therefore should suffer the most cuts. The senators said in a letter Tuesday that a Pentagon-appointed commission should consider `` regional inequities'' as it decides which bases to close. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> had signed the base-closing bill just one day earlier. It authorizes the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> to close unneeded military bases to achieve savings of up to $ 5 billion per year. A 12-member commission is authorized to make the decisions and report on is conclusions by Dec. 31. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> may veto the entire list but can not act to protect individual bases, as it often has in the past. `` We wish to prevent the further entrenchment of regional inequities stemming from the location of existing military facilities,'' said the letter from members of the <ORGANIZATION> Northeast-Midwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION>. The letter was addressed to <PERSON> Abraham </PERSON> <PERSON> Ribicoff </PERSON>, a former senator from <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> who co-chairs the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary's <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> on Base Realignment and Closure. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Abbee </PERSON>, spokesman for the base closing commission, laughed and said, `` So what's new?'' when told about the senators' letter. <PERSON> Abbee </PERSON> said he would not comment further until he had seen a copy. The senators said in their letter that <ORGANIZATION> Sunbelt </ORGANIZATION> states already enjoy an advantage in numbers of bases. The letter pointed to a report by congressional conferees on the base-closing bill that said geography should `` be carefully weighed during the commission's deliberations leading to its closure and realignment recommendations.'' However, that provision was dropped before the legislation was given final approval. <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> will have until Jan. 15 to accept or reject the list of recommended base closings. Signing the letter were the two senators each from <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, and Sen. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Biden </PERSON>, D-Del., <PERSON> Claiborne </PERSON> <PERSON> Pell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-R.I. </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Lugar </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Ind </LOCATION>

<HEAD>Government To Send `Dear Farmer Jones' Letters To Late Borrowers</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 About 90,000 farmers who are behind in their loan repayments to the <ORGANIZATION> Farmers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> will be getting notices shortly after the Nov. 8 election telling them to start making arrangements for settlement. The <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> agency said Tuesday the notices will be an attempt to collect about $ 8.8 billion in past-due loans. Spokesman <PERSON> Marlyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Aycock </PERSON> said rules implementing new credit legislation will take effect Nov. 14 and that `` Dear Farmer Jones'' notices will start going out soon thereafter to the delinquent FmHA borrowers. <PERSON> Aycock </PERSON> said the notices will say: `` This is to inform you that you're seriously behind in your loan payments and to inform you of your options. Farmers who are more than 180 days late in making payments have several options.'' The notices will explain that the <ORGANIZATION> FmHA </ORGANIZATION> borrowers must notify the agency within 45 days if they intend to apply to make arrangements for settling their debts. Details regarding the options, including debt restructuring and write-offs, also will be provided. <PERSON> Aycock </PERSON> said the timetable for sending out the notices as promptly as possible took into consideration the months of rulemaking, periods for public comment and time for training FmHA people to handle the additional job load. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> ordered <ORGANIZATION> FmHA </ORGANIZATION> to revise its lending practices in the Agricultural Credit Act of 1987. The agency is often called the farm lender of last resort because it makes loans only to those who can not qualify at banks or other commercial sources. The debt write-down, or forgiveness provision, is regarded as one of the most important parts of the 1987 law. It allows FmHA to reduce a farmer's delinquent debt to the recovery value of the collateral, which is usually land or farm equipment, depending on cash flow and other factors. Also, as the result of lawsuits, the <ORGANIZATION> FmHA </ORGANIZATION> is under court order to redo many of its loan regulations and to hold up on foreclosures and forced liquidations until those actions are completed. Estimates of the extent of <ORGANIZATION> FmHA </ORGANIZATION> loan delinquencies and numbers of farmers potentially threatened by foreclosure under the new rules have varied. Last May 23, when the new regulations were proposed, FmHA losses resulting from write-offs and other settlements were estimated at about $ 8.7 billion and that about 118,000 borrowers were delinquent. About 64,800 of those could be pushed into liquidation or foreclosure because they could n't qualify for help under the new law. Another major step was an interim rule announced on Sept. 14, including procedures for making debt restructuring and write-downs. Those were to take effect on Oct. 14 on an interim basis and called for final adoption on Nov. 14 after a 60-day period for public comments. In the September announcement, the earlier analysis was used again which referred to 118,000 delinquent borrowers, including about 65,000 who would be rejected for debt write-downs. The potential losses were said to be as high as $ 9.4 billion, although about $ 1 billion could be salvaged by the agency. <PERSON> Aycock </PERSON> said the current estimate of 90,000 delinquent borrowers was based on figures last fall, when <ORGANIZATION> FmHA </ORGANIZATION> delinquencies are historically lower than those in January, when the 118,000 were reported.

 <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> scientists say that tiny beneficial worms, or nematodes, can be produced in a laboratory, dried out for storage and revived later to fight destructive pests in back yards. `` They're still living and breathing but they're dormant,'' says entomologist <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lindegran </PERSON> of the department's <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> laboratory, <LOCATION> Fresno </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>. Lindegran and researchers at a <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> biotechnology firm, <ORGANIZATION> Biosys </ORGANIZATION>, found that the microscopic nematodes such as Steinernema feltiae can be dried, stored as a `` paste'' under refrigeration and then revived with water `` When you add water, the worms plump back up again,'' <PERSON> Lindegran </PERSON> said in a report issued here by the <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> agency. `` When they start moving around, they're ready to be sprayed onto plants, trees or soil.'' The beneficial nematodes attack pests that are in the larvaal or wormlike stage of development by entering through openings such as the mouth or breathing tubes, he said. `` Once inside a pest, the nematodes excrete a unique bacterium that kills the pest, is food for the nematodes and produces antibiotics that keep other bacteria at bay,'' <PERSON> Lindegran </PERSON> said. The nematodes are harmless to humans but lethal to a variety of pests, including carpenterworms, cutworms, armyworms, fruit flies and root maggots.

 _ <LOCATION> WASHINGTON </LOCATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- _ Exports of farm crops in the fiscal year that ended on Sept. 30 required the production from about 107 million harvested acres, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. That represented 36 percent of the 301 million acres of crops harvested in the 1987-88 year, the department's <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said in a new outlook report on the nation's agricultural resources. Although the 1987-88 export acreage was up 11 percent from the previous year, it was far below the record high of 137 million acres in 1980, the report said. Of the 107 million acres needed to grow crops for export last year, food grains _ mainly wheat and rice _ led with 40 million acres, followed by oilseeds -LRB- mostly soybeans -RRB-, 30 million; feed grains -LRB- mostly corn -RRB-, 21 million; cotton, 11 million; and other crops, 11 million.

<TEXT>
 The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration is preparing to support a loan request by <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION> in the <ORGANIZATION> Inter-American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>, indicating a policy shift that <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials say reflects improved human rights performance in that country. The bank was expected to take up <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION>'s request for a $ 35 million loan for rural road repair today. The administration has invariably abstained on such requests in recent years as evidence of its displeasure toward the policies of the country's military government. According to the officials, <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION>'s human rights record has improved substantially in recent months, with the lifting of a 15-year old state of emergency in August and a national plebiscite held three weeks ago. Chilean voters denied President <PERSON> Augusto </PERSON> <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> an additional eight-year term and open elections are scheduled for next year. Until recently, the administration had frequently criticized <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION> on grounds that it was one of only a handful of hemispheric countries that had not moved toward democratic rule. The only exception to the administration's policy of abstaining on Chilean loan requests involved projects that offered direct benefits to the poor. The pending request before the <ORGANIZATION> IADB </ORGANIZATION> does not fall into that category. The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials, insisting on anonymity, said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> decision to support the road repair loan does not mean <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION> can count on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> backing for future loan requests. Those votes will be based on <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION>'s future human rights record and on the viability of the project for which financing is sought. Abstentions cast by American delegates to the <ORGANIZATION> IADB </ORGANIZATION> and other international financial institutions on Chilean requests usually were symbolic because <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION> was able to count on enough support from other bank members to ensure approval of its applications. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is the principal contributor to the <ORGANIZATION> IADB </ORGANIZATION>, which was set up 30 years ago to promote development in <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. The administration policy to abstain on most Chilean requests generally was supported by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, which enacted a statute a decade ago barring the executive branch from assisting countries engaging in `` gross and consistent'' human rights violations. <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION> was never placed in that category but the administration decided to show disapproval over the situation in <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION> through the abstention policy. There are a number of other impediments to the restoration of normal relations between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION>. For more than a decade, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has barred military aid and training to <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION> as well as bilateral economic aid. The officials said no decision on lifting any of these sanctions is expected this year.

 <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON> and his co-defendants perpetrated `` a classic fraud on government'' when they diverted profits from the U.S.-Iran arms sales to help arm the Nicaraguan rebels, prosecutors said. Responding to <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s contention that he did not defraud the government, prosecutors said the four Iran-Contra defendants created a `` secret slush fund'' for activities `` outside the normal channels of governmental accountability.'' By overcharging <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> for weapons in the arms-for-hostage transactions, <PERSON> North </PERSON> and the others undermined President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s initiative to free Americans held in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> by pro-Iranian groups, independent counsel <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> said in pleadings filed Tuesday North and former national security adviser <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON> `` chose to advance their private, unauthorized ends at the cost of putting at hazard the ends they were supposed to be pursuing, including that of saving the lives of the Americans held hostage in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>.'' North, <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON> and arms dealers <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Hakim </PERSON> and retired <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> Maj. Gen. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Secord </PERSON> are charged with conspiring to defraud the government and theft by diverting more than $ 14 million in arms-sale profits to a criminal `` enterprise'' that secretly financed the Nicaraguan Contra rebels. North's lawyers contended in pleadings filed Oct. 11 that there was no fraud or theft because the government did n't own the weapons after they were sold to <PERSON> Secord </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hakim </PERSON>, who acted as middlemen in the transactions. But <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> said the alleged scheme `` constitutes a classic fraud on the government.'' `` The thrust of the fraud is the breach of the public trust: <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON>'s and <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s discharge of their official duties -LRB- e.g., execution of the <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> initiative -RRB- was driven by a concealed and wholly improper motive _ a desire to generate a slush fund for use in financing unauthorized activities designated by them.'' Prosecutors said <PERSON> North </PERSON>, a retired <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> lieutenant colonel, `` exploited his position to exact from Iranians a high selling price, while concealing from the government the nature of the price spread and his control over the excess profits.'' `` The goals of establishing improved relations with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and potentially securing the release of American hostages held by groups sympathetic to that country were undermined and put seriously at risk by the conspirators' private motive to charge prices well in excess of what otherwise might have been charged in order to secure additional profits,'' the prosecution said. `` Defendants <PERSON> Secord </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hakim </PERSON> agreed to hold funds generated by <PERSON> North </PERSON> and to apply them to purposes selected by <PERSON> North </PERSON> and <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON> outside the normal challenges of governmental accountability,'' prosecutors said. <PERSON> Secord </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hakim </PERSON> `` reaped lucrative profits from the money <PERSON> North </PERSON> steered to them'' as middlemen in the transactions, prosecutors said. Prosecutors said they were not required to show that the defendants' activities undermined <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s effort to free the hostages. `` It is enough that it was reasonably foreseeable that they would have that effect, as it clearly was.'' No date has been set for the trial of <LOCATION> North </LOCATION>, the first of four trials ordered by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Gerhard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON>.

 Private exporters have sold <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> an additional 400,000 metric tons of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> wheat at subsidized prices for shipment in December, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. The sales, equal to about 14.7 million bushels, were handled by six companies: <ORGANIZATION> Cargill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, 50,000 tons; <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Grain </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, 110,000; <ORGANIZATION> Richco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Grain </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, 40,000; <ORGANIZATION> Louis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dreyfus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, 120,000; <ORGANIZATION> Bunge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, 40,000; and <ORGANIZATION> Mitsubishi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, 40,000. <PERSON> Melvin </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sims </PERSON>, general manager for the department's <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, said Tuesday the sales were part of 2 million tons of wheat authorized on Aug. 18 under the Export Enhancement Program. Although no selling prices or other details were announced, recent prices of wheat at farm points have averaged around $ 3.84 per bushel, indicating a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> farm value of about $ 56 million. A metric ton is about 2,205 pounds and is equal to 36.7 bushels of wheat. The program enables exporters to sell wheat and other designated commodities to specified countries at reduced prices in order to meet foreign competition. The exporters then collect free government surpluses of grain or other products as bonuses, or subsidies. <PERSON> Sims </PERSON> said the bonuses due the six exporters for the latest deal averaged $ 21.12 per ton of wheat, or about 58 cents per bushel. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> has an additional 560,000 tons of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> wheat available under the Export Enhancement Program, he said.

 The massive rescue effort to save two <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> gray whales wo n't make a difference to the survival of the species, but it's been a public relations dream for environmentalists trying to rouse the world to save its oceans `` What's the big deal? I do n't know. It all of a sudden exploded,'' said <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Braham </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mammal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratory </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>, the chief <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> research center on whales. `` Only the individual can answer if it's worth it,'' <PERSON> Braham </PERSON> said. `` We're dealing with the human spirit. We allow some awfully damning things to go unchecked and then we reach out to something with a tear in our eye.'' The leviathan rescue has thrown together an unlikely army of would-be saviors: whale-hunting Eskimos, <ORGANIZATION> Greenpeace </ORGANIZATION> environmentalists, oil companies, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet governments, wildlife experts, animal behavior specialists and chainsaw mechanics. An international cast of some 40 to 60 reporters keeps the world informed of any progress. The two surviving gray whales imprisoned by the ice are part of an endangered species, meaning they are thought to be in imminent danger of becoming extinct. But the population of grays is flourishing. There are about 21,000, which is near the historic peak of 25,000 reached before whale hunters slaughtered all but a few thousand around the turn of the century. The Soviets kill 169 gray whales each year to feed Eskimos under an exemption granted by the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Whaling </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, and another 1,000 animals die of natural causes yearly, according to government estimates. Despite the losses, the population of grays increases by 2.5 percent a year, and the deaths of three wayward whales not yet old enough to breed would be insignificant, scientists said. `` There's no loss from a biological standpoint,'' said research biologist <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Withrow </PERSON> from the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mammal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratory </ORGANIZATION>. But cold facts have no chance against heated emotions when human nature fights Mother Nature. The whales have names. Biologists call the two survivors <PERSON> Bonnet </PERSON> and Crossbeak. The Inupiat Eskimos who discovered them Oct. 7 call them <PERSON> Putu </PERSON> and <PERSON> Siku </PERSON> for Ice Hole and Ice. A third whale, Bone or Kanik for Snowflake, apparently died Friday. Television brought the whales into <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> homes. Nightly pictures of their battered and bleeding snouts protruding from a breathing hole cut like a harpoon into American hearts. `` These animals are turning out to be ambassadors for all marine life,'' said <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Vernon </PERSON> of the Whale Museum in <LOCATION> Friday </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION> `` I do n't think it's overreaction. It's a catharsis. The helping hand was extended. And it was extended in good faith.'' Gray whales feed in the icy <LOCATION> Arctic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION>, then migrate 7,000 miles to breed off balmy <LOCATION> Baja </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. The three trapped whales were migrating for the first time. Even experienced bowhead whales, equipped with thick skulls to break through ice, get hemmed in. About 10 to 12 of them perish each year off northern <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, biologists said. Some have questioned the expense of trying to save the whales _ which had reached upward of $ 600,000 and counting as of Monday _ while funding for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> whale research has been cut. The annual budget for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mammal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratory </ORGANIZATION> is $ 2 million, down from $ 2.8 million in 1985. `` However much money they're spending on the rescue is fine,'' said <PERSON> Patty </PERSON> <PERSON> Warhol </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cetacean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pedro </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION> `` That money might be better used in research, but you just ca n't buy that kind of public relations for whales,'' she said `` Today, there are people all over the country talking about whales who two weeks ago did n't know they existed or thought they were big fish.'' The mercy mission has melted hearts of grizzled oil field roustabouts from the bone-chilling North Slope, who also have reaped a public relations harvest of good will for their labors. <ORGANIZATION> VECO </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Prudhoe </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> offered to send a 185-ton ice pulverizing hoverbarge to smash a pathway to the sea, with <ORGANIZATION> ARCO </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alaska </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> donating fuel to the <ORGANIZATION> Alaska </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> helicopter that tried vainly to coax it to the whales. The barge got stuck in shallow water. `` It was a common cause to help the underdog. We're human too,'' said <PERSON> Marvin </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON>, operations manager for <ORGANIZATION> VECO </ORGANIZATION>. `` It's not money. It's not headlines. We wanted to do what we could to help another mammal.'' `` We did what we should have done,'' said <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Odom </PERSON>, senior vice president of <ORGANIZATION> ARCO </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alaska </ORGANIZATION>. `` It's a sad sight to see them struggling to stay alive. What's that worth to help them? We're not discouraged by the naysayers.''

 One made `` Bad.'' The other makes `` Ram'' pickup trucks. And <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Iacocca </PERSON> had a similarly brief exchange of words when the pop superstar met the <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> chairman. <PERSON> Iacocca </PERSON> met <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> backstage shortly before the singer performed Monday night at the Palace of <LOCATION> Auburn </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION>. The meeting was set up after one of <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s attorneys wrote to <PERSON> Iacocca </PERSON>. `` <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> had read <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>'s book -LRB- ` Talking Straight' -RRB- and, you know, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> is mentioned in the book,'' <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Guiniven </PERSON> said. `` There was a mutual interest in the meeting.'' But <PERSON> Guiniven </PERSON> said he had no idea what the two said to each other. In `` Talking Straight,'' <PERSON> Iacocca </PERSON> defended the $ 20.5 million he made in 1986 through salary and stock options, writing: `` $ 20 million sounds more like <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s income for a weekend than the annual pay of a guy who ca n't carry a tune in the shower.'' <PERSON> Iacocca </PERSON>'s estimate was off the mark if Monday night's show was anywhere near <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s standard. Net income from the concert was $ 125,000, an amount <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> donated Sunday to the Motown Museum, honoring the Motown Records label to which he and his brothers were signed in 1969.

 Two Soviet ships arrived and one began pounding through ice Tuesday in an effort to free two gray whales trapped off the northern <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> coast for nearly three weeks. The Admiral <PERSON> Makarov </PERSON> started breaking ice almost immediately after the vessel arrived near Point Barrow. By evening, the ship had made substantial progress and was expected to continue working through the night, with its companion cargo vessel, the <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> Arseniev </PERSON>, clearing away the shattered ice. The Soviet ships flew the flags of both the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in a symbol of international cooperation. The rescue effort, called Operation Breakthrough, also has involved Eskimos with chain saws and an unusual vehicle called an Archimedes screw tractor acting in concert. `` It's very nice to work together to do something good between two people,'' said <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Patzevich </PERSON>, chief officer of the Admiral <PERSON> Makarov </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> Capt. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> McClelland </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> called the effort `` terrific'' and was optimistic the whales would be freed. `` With the wind going the way it is, it could n't be better,'' he said. Biologists reported the whales were in good condition. They moved around a shoal through which they had refused to pass earlier, and by Tuesday night they were about two miles from an open lead, or pathway, through the ice and 2 miles beyond the site at which they and another whale were found. Rescuers, meanwhile, received one bit of good news about the jumbled mass of ice. They discovered that a pressure ridge apparently was not anchored to the sea bottom as initially was feared. A pressure ridge is where two opposing ice masses meet. `` It appears that most of the ridge has a current running through it, making it easier for the icebreakers to work,'' said <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Morris </PERSON>, a biologist with the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oceanic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atmospheric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>. The <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> gray whales must get through the tangle if they are to reach the nearest completely open water, 200 miles away in the <LOCATION> Chukchi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Hufford </PERSON>, with the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, said he and another ice expert were working on the pressure ridge Monday when they had some unwelcome company _ a polar bear. A helicopter pilot landed the aircraft between the whales and the bear, which caused the animal to leave. `` It's something to remember. There are not only whales out there,'' <PERSON> Hufford </PERSON> said. The whales were stranded about 100 yards offshore nearly three weeks ago by shifting ice about 13 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Barrow </LOCATION>. A third whale disappeared Friday and is presumed dead. Biologists reported a setback late Monday when the whales balked near a shoal and retreated about a half-mile toward shore. <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> George </PERSON>, a biologist with the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Slope </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Borough </ORGANIZATION>, said the whales overnight remained well back from a series of new breathing holes that had been cut toward the ice ridge. They apparently were spooked by the shallow water. There is about 12 feet of water over the 125-yard-wide shoal, <PERSON> George </PERSON> said. The whales had been spending most of the time in water 17 - to 25 feet deep The turnaround came after rescuers switched tactics Monday. They connected a series of breathing holes to form a single open channel some 600 yards long. Eskimos used long poles to guide the miniature icebergs toward the rear of the slot. Initially, the strategy worked. But when the channel behind them was nearly filled, the whales reversed course, struggling up for air by poking their way through the large slabs of ice and thick slush. That setback offset earlier excitement about the performance of the Archimedes screw tractor, a 12-ton machine that smashes up to 18 inches of ice as it moves along on pontoons shaped like augers. It leaves a slushy path 14-feet wide in its wake. Technicians were building a rake of sorts Tuesday, designed to follow along in the channel behind the big auger. The rake is supposed to shunt the slush down and under the adjacent ice, officials said. Biologists said they also were considering `` Plan C,'' a last-ditch possibility that they may have to airlift the animals to open water. <PERSON> Withrow </PERSON> said it was a last resort because the whales could be injured.

<TEXT>
 Wages in the past 12 months have risen an average 3.9 percent, but private employer costs for benefits have soared 6.7 percent _ more than double the previous year _ largely on increases in Social Security taxes, the government said Tuesday. The combined effect of the pay raises and higher benefit costs have sent total employer costs up 4.7 percent in the 12 months ending Oct. 1, compared with a 3.4 percent rise in the previous 12-month period, the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said. Inflation, as measured by the Consumer Price Index, has risen by 4.2 percent over the past 12 months, the government reported last week. The steep increase in benefit costs resulted primarily from a rise last January in employers' Social Security tax rate from 7.15 percent to 7.51 percent, the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said. It also cited large increases in health insurance costs and lump-sum bonus payments from profit-sharing arrangements, which are now calculated by the government as a benefit rather than a wage. In the 12 months ending October a year ago, benefits costs rose only 3.1 percent, but they went up 6.7 percent in 12 months ending Oct. 1. Non-union employees continued to get bigger percentage pay raises than union members _ a trend begun in 1983 _ except for blue-collar workers in manufacturing. The <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Statistics </ORGANIZATION> said wage rates among union members rose an average 2.9 percent in the past 12 months, compared with 3.9 percent for non-union workers. In the previous 12-month period, union wages rose an average 1.7 percent, compared with 3.8 percent for non-union employees. `` This pattern reversed when limited to blue-collar workers in manufacturing,'' the bureau said, with wage increases in the past year averaging 3.2 percent for union members and 2.8 percent for non-union workers. For the first time, the government also is comparing total compensation increases between union and non-union workers to account for the lump-sum arrangements. With those benefits included, employer costs rose the same 4.5 percent among union and non-union employees, the bureau said. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Zalusky </PERSON>, an economist for the <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION>, called the statistics `` refreshing.'' `` They're beginning to show in fact what is really going on out there in the world,'' he said, `` but there still is a good way to go.'' For example, <PERSON> Zalusky </PERSON> cited the last round of steel industry contracts in which the union conceded pay cuts to companies then operating at losses in exchange for a share of future profits or stock transfers if no profits occurred. `` The statistics are now picking up the profit distributions but not the stock transfers for what essentially is a debt owed workers,'' he said. `` In the future I expect them to start putting in the value of stock ownership plans and in the distant future retraining funds, such as those negotiated with the auto companies.'' Despite the disparity in percentage wage increases in recent years, unionized workers continue to make about 35 percent more than non-union workers _ an average gap of $ 123 a week in 1987 compared with a gap of $ 119 in 1986 _ according to government data. Among white-collar workers, wage increases have averaged 4.2 percent over the past 12 months, compared with 4 percent the previous 12 months, the government said. Blue-collar wages have increased a smaller 3.3 percent, respectively, over the same two periods. The biggest pay gains, 5.6 percent, were among business and health service workers, followed by an average increases of 4.9 percent for professional and technical employees. Managers and executives, along with state and local government workers, have averaged the same 4.7 percent wage gains over the past year. The average pay increase among private industry workers was 3.7 percent, for a combined average gain for all workers of 3.9 percent, the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said. By regions, the biggest pay increases over the past 12 months have been in the <LOCATION> Northeast </LOCATION>, 4.6 percent, followed by the South at 3.8 percent. Average raises in the West and <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> were 3.2 percent and 2.9 percent, respectively. In a separate report Tuesday, the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said annual pay rose an average 4.6 percent among the 101 million workers with jobs in the nation's 317 metropolitan areas last year. <LOCATION> Kenosha </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wis. </LOCATION>, with large pay increases in manufacturing and construction, had the biggest average increase, up 10.6 percent _ from $ 18,666 in 1986 to $ 20,648 in 1987. The <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Haven-Waterbury-Meriden </LOCATION> area of <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Monmouth-Ocean </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, metropolitan areas were next with average annual pay increases of 8.4 percent last year. On the other end of the scale, workers in <LOCATION> Flint </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>, with a large decline in employment and falling wages in manufacturing, suffered an average pay loss of 4.2 percent _ from $ 26,633 in 1986 to $ 25,514 last year. Other cities in which average pay fell last year were <LOCATION> Anchorage </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Ind </LOCATION>.; <PERSON> Enid </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Okla. </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Kan. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Lansing </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Midland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>; and Pine Bluff, Ark. Despite the decline, <LOCATION> Anchorage </LOCATION> continued to have the highest average pay level in the country at $ 28,486. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> was next at $ 28,179, followed by the <LOCATION> Bridgeport-Stamford-Nowalk-Danbury </LOCATION> area of <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> at $ 27,832 and <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jose </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, at $ 27,748. <LOCATION> Jacksonville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, again had the lowest average annual pay at $ 13,246, followed by three <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> border areas: McAllen-Edinburg-Mission at $ 13,311, <PERSON> Brownsville-Harlingen </PERSON> at $ 14,087 and <LOCATION> Laredo </LOCATION> at $ 14,093.

 What do you do when your presidential candidate is a bit too boring, lacking the star quality that sends crowds into a frenzy? You cast your gaze on <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> and search the sports arenas for the celebrities who can inject a little glamour into your campaign. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Redford </PERSON>. <PERSON> Cher </PERSON>. <PERSON> Charlton </PERSON> <PERSON> Heston </PERSON>. Morgan Fairchild. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Elway </PERSON>. <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>. Aides to Democrat <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and Republican <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> _ definite runners-up in the glamour category _ have enlisted the help of <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION>'s box-office draws and sports' superstars to attract a crowd, liven up a stump speech and capture a few more precious seconds on the evening news. When <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> delivered a speech denouncing the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration's environmental record to a college audience in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Brunswick </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, he was accompanied by actor, director and environmentalist <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Redford </PERSON>. The blond-haired star of such movies as `` Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid,'' `` Downhill Racer,'' `` The Candidate'' and `` Legal Eagles'' drew squeals and cheers from the large crowd on the <ORGANIZATION> Rutgers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> campus. <PERSON> Redford </PERSON> also delivered a line that made every network news program. `` Hello everybody, I'm <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>,'' joked <PERSON> Redford </PERSON>, whom <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> has been said to resemble. <PERSON> Redford </PERSON> continued his effort to help <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, appearing at a toxic landfill in <LOCATION> Aurora </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colo. </LOCATION>, a once-heavily polluted river in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> and other stops around the nation. `` I'm a citizen just like you are,'' <PERSON> Redford </PERSON> told the crowd in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> earlier this month. `` Being an actor does n't mean you lose your citizenship.'' At the Republican National Convention, the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> had actor <PERSON> Charlton </PERSON> <PERSON> Heston </PERSON> intone the Pledge of Allegiance in a voice many believe is what God sounds like. It worked as delegates chattering and moving about on the convention floor paused to join the `` <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Hur </PERSON>'' and `` Ten Commandments'' star in reciting the pledge. Even before <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> had secured the nominations, the campaigns were using celebrities. Tennis star <PERSON> Pam </PERSON> <PERSON> Shriver </PERSON>, in her job with the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign, called members of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s `` 1139 Club,'' which included current and former party officials selected as delegates to the convention. The number 1,139 was the total needed to win the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> nomination. Through a questionnaire, the campaign determined delegate background information such as birthdays, personal interests and issues of most concern. `` It's an effort to create a national <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> family,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Sparks </PERSON>, who served as <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s chief delegate counter. Ms. <PERSON> Shriver </PERSON>, who was assigned three or four delegates to keep in touch with, was available to discuss both the vice president's campaign and how to improve a cross-court volley Former <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Giants </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Minnesota </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Vikings </ORGANIZATION> quarterback <PERSON> Fran </PERSON> <PERSON> Tarkenton </PERSON>, now an <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> businessman, has served as honorary <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign co-chairman in <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> where he is recruiting businessmen. `` We need to get off the seats of our pants,'' <PERSON> Tarkenton </PERSON> said last month in announcing his plans. But involvement in the political process does n't always draw praise. When <ORGANIZATION> Penn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> football coach <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Paterno </PERSON> agreed to deliver a seconding speech for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> at the GOP convention, the state's Democratic Gov <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Casey </PERSON> criticized <PERSON> Paterno </PERSON>, questioning whether a state college coach should take on such a high-profile political posture. <PERSON> Paterno </PERSON>, who coached his football team to a national championship two years ago, gave the speech anyway. Fifty celebrities, including Ms. Fairchild, <PERSON> Cher </PERSON>, <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON> <PERSON> Peck </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Hollywood </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Brat Pack'' star <PERSON> Rob </PERSON> <PERSON> Lowe </PERSON>, chose to help the Democratic cause by traveling to cities in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> for a voter registration drive. Meanwhile, some of their compatriots in the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> area met for the traditional <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> political event _ a fund-raiser with the candidate. Television producer <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> Lear </PERSON> held the celebrity fete last month for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, with `` <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> Vice'' star <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, actor <PERSON> Burgess </PERSON> <PERSON> Meredith </PERSON>, comedian <LOCATION> Chevy </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Chase </LOCATION> and actress Goldie Hawn in attendance. Some superstars, however, get involved without knowing it. Republican vice presidential candidate <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> received <ORGANIZATION> Denver </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broncos </ORGANIZATION> quarterback <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Elway </PERSON>'s autograph and jersey during the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> candidate's stop in <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>. The team's treasurer and chief financial officer made the presentation _ unbeknown to <PERSON> Elway </PERSON>. `` I'm glad -LRB- <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> -RRB- got it, instead of <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, because I'm going for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Elway </PERSON> said when informed of the gift.

 Election violence broke out after a two-week lull when <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> supporters tried to push past police to attack the car of Foreign Minister and <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON> <PERSON> Peres </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Itim </ORGANIZATION> news agency reported. Nine Likud supporters were arrested in Tuesday's skirmish in the <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION> suburb of <ORGANIZATION> Petah </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tikva </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Itim </ORGANIZATION> also reported that unknown assailants twice fired shots at the headquarters of the Communist party, Hadash, in the Arab city of <LOCATION> Nazareth </LOCATION> in northern <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. Earlier in the campaign, protesters threw stones at <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> and his second-in-command, Defense Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON>, during separate appearances in the towns of <LOCATION> Kiryat </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gat </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Afula </LOCATION>. During a rally in <LOCATION> Beit </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Shemesh </LOCATION>, a 61-year-old man dumped a cup of beer on <PERSON> Peres </PERSON>. The violence appeared to taper off after Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>, leader of the right-wing <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, appealed to party activists for calm. Dozens of <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> supporters, however, showed up Tuesday at a Peres rally in <ORGANIZATION> Petah </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tikva </ORGANIZATION> and heckled the leader of the left-leaning <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> as he delivered a campaign speech. Later, they rushed at <PERSON> Peres </PERSON>' car after police formed a protective circle and tried to hustle him away from in front of city hall. Earlier Tuesday, police and bodyguards surrounded <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> as he campaigned at the crowded central bus station in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>. Dozens of admirers drowned out the boos of opponents with the cry `` <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> will bring peace.'' One businessman said he would vote Labor because the party promises to hand back the densely inhabited portions of the territories <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> seized from <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> in the 1967 <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> war. `` <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> says he'll give away the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. That's half our demographic problem right there,'' businessman <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosen </PERSON> said. During the campaign, Labor has used the euphemism `` demographic problem'' to refer to the fact that Palestinians will eventually outnumber Jews if <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> holds on to the occupied territories. At least 1.5 million Arabs live in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, and 700,000 more live inside <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. The Jewish population of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> is about 3.5 million but is growing at a far slower rate than the Arab population. Labor urges handing control of large parts of the occupied territories to <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> to assure a Jewish majority inside <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. The 11-month uprising against Israeli rule by Palestinians in the occupied lands that has claimed the lives of at least 303 Palestinians and six Israelis. Thousands of Palestinians have been wounded and arrested. The reported shooting in <LOCATION> Nazareth </LOCATION> was the latest in a series of incidents in the Arab sector primarily involving the three <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> parties _ <ORGANIZATION> Hadash </ORGANIZATION>, the Progressive List for Peace, and the <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. The Arab parties and some Jewish ones are vying for the 350,000 votes in the Arab sector. In some villages, party activists have been roughed up and warned to stop their activities by members of rival groups. Polls indicate that the race between Labor and <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION>, uneasy partners in the current governing coalition, is closely contested. The election is Nov. 1.

<HEAD>Webster Says Chemical, Germ Weapons Threats Growing</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOAN MOWER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Determining which countries are making chemical and biological weapons will be one of the most difficult challenges facing the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> in the next decade, the agency's director says. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Webster </PERSON>, who became head of the spy agency in May 1987, said Tuesday that <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> is `` developing the largest chemical plant that I know of for chemical warfare.'' In a speech to the World Affairs Council, <PERSON> Webster </PERSON> said the intelligence community must pay close attention to developments in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> in the 1990s. He also said morale at the agency was high, rejected the notion that covert activities should be carried out by the military and said congressional review plays an important role in guiding the spy agency. He stressed his concern about chemical weapons, which he said were used both by <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> in their eight-year war that was halted by a cease-fire in August. `` Intelligence support will be vital to the success of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> efforts to prevent the use of chemical weapons,'' he said, noting that President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has called for an international conference to revive a ban on chemical weapons. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will try to block the export of chemical weapons and ballistic missile technology, he said. <PERSON> Webster </PERSON> said chemical weapons, often referred to as the poor man's nuclear arms, are being developed by more than 20 countries. As many as 10 countries are working on production of biological weapons. These weapons could affect stability in southeast <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> and in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> where the balance of power may be altered by the production of chemical weapons by at least three <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> states: <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. Of particular concern to the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> is the possibility that countries might arm ballistic weapons with chemical warheads, he said. `` Virtually every city in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> is now subject to such an attack if these two types of weapons are combined,'' he said. Among the weapons that are being made are mustard gas, nerve agents and some that use industrial chemicals such as cyanide and phosgene. `` Most of these plants look like nothing more than fertilizer plants and are difficult to detect,'' he said. `` Assessing the proliferation of chemical and biological weapons is one of the most difficult challenges we face in the intelligence community, now and into the next decade. It is also one of our most important tasks for these weapons may well represent one of the most serious threats to world peace in the coming years,'' he said. Discussing U.S.-Soviet relations, <PERSON> Webster </PERSON> said Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s reforms present intelligence agents `` with a very formidable challenge.'' The <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> must assess the impact of the reforms. Regardless of the arms control agreements signed between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Webster </PERSON> said, `` our relationship is likely to remain adversarial.'' The <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> head said he expects the Soviets will adhere to their plan to withdraw troops from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> by next February, but <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> will continue to maintain ties to the <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> regime. `` We believe <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> will remain unstable for a period of time,'' he said. The Afghan rebels will likely continue fighting among themselves, and 5 million refugees, the majority of whom are in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, must be resettled. Although Moslems predominate in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Webster </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> does not believe a fundamentalist regime such as that of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> will dominate With the end of the Iran-Iraq war, intelligence analysts will try to find out what each country's intention is in the region. The Americans also want to learn what effect the war's end will have on the American hostages held in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> by pro-Iranian groups, he said.

<HEAD>Reagan Decides Dispute Over Inspections Needed Under Strategic
Weapons Treaty</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has resolved a dispute between the State and <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Departments </ORGANIZATION> over how much on-site inspection should be sought in negotiations with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> on a treaty to reduce long-range nuclear missiles, according to a report published today. The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> says the president chose a plan backed by the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Civilian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> leaders had argued in favor of a far broader verification proposal. Under the proposal chosen, a list of sites would be agreed upon at which each side could conduct short-notice inspections, The Times says. Each country would be given the right to conduct snap inspections at these designated sites, mainly those used to make rocket motors for solid-fuel missiles, said the newspaper, citing unidentified administration officials. Each country also would have the right to request quick inspections of any facility in the other's territory, but if the facility was not on the list of designated sites, the request could be denied. The party that rejected the inspection would be required to explain its reasons and to take action to alleviate the other side's concerns over possible cheating, <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> said The newspaper said the plan was generally supported by the <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chiefs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Staff </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Arms </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disarmament </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> as well as the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. The treaty banning intermediate-range nuclear missiles, ratified by both countries, provides for short-notice inspections of missile sites and stationing inspectors at one missile assembly plant in each country. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet strategic arms negotiators are expected to recess their talks in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> in mid-November and not resume them until next year.

 Key problems among children in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s cities, including drug abuse, pregnancy and school dropouts, have grown worse over the past five years, according to a report released today by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mayors </ORGANIZATION> These problems, plus inadequate health care for children in low-income families and a lack of affordable child care, worsened in 80 percent of the cities that cited them, the study said. The report surveyed officials in 52 cities in 22 states and the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>. It was financed by the <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Child </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> and published by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Officials </ORGANIZATION>, an affiliate of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mayors </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Cochran </PERSON>, executive director of the mayor's group and the affiliate, said the report was intended to `` lead us toward critically needed investments in our children's future and, consequently, in our country's future.'' The study also said poverty was a high-priority problem facing children in urban areas. It estimated that 28.5 percent of the more than 18.5 million children living in central cities live in poverty, compared with a 20 percent poverty rate for all <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> children. The study found problems affecting children in the cities include: _ Insufficient day care It said an estimated 45 percent of the need for licensed child care goes unmet. _ A 38 percent average high school dropout rate in the class of 1988 even though 60 percent of the cities reported investing public money in programs to encourage students to stay in school _ A 14.6 percent rate of births to mostly unmarried teen-age mothers among the 529,458 births in the survey cities during 1986 The rate of births to black teens was even higher at 21.6 percent that year. _ An infant mortality rate among blacks of 18.5 per thousand in 1986, compared with a rate of 12.6 per thousand for all infants The report said mayors of the survey cities believe the most important policy decisions to be made by the next president for the benefit of children `` would be to increase the availability of child care, provide adequate funding for family and children's programs, increase the emphasis on and funding for substance abuse prevention, and make a greater investment in education.''

<HEAD>Ex-Whiz Kid Testifies He Was Frightened Into Fraud</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LINDA DEUTSCH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A fallen whiz kid who made and lost millions in carpet cleaning admitted at his securities fraud trial he was so desperate to keep the business afloat he stole his grandmother's jewelry <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Minkow </PERSON>, seeking to dispel his image as a corrupt business prodigy, testified Tuesday that he was a frightened little boy manipulated by extortionists. `` I did n't know what to do,'' said <PERSON> Minkow </PERSON>, who admitted he perpetrated a multimillion-dollar swindle that defrauded investors of about $ 25 million. `` I was in the 11th grade. I had a lot of trouble sleeping. I knew I was in a lot of trouble.'' <PERSON> Minkow </PERSON>, now 22, took the stand as the first defense witness and told jurors how his youthful ambition led him to form the ZZZZ Best carpet cleaning company at age 16 in his parent's garage. But he said he could not have done it without a $ 1,600 loan from a man he portrayed as his Svengali, <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Krowpman </PERSON>. `` He was my idol,'' <PERSON> Minkow </PERSON> told jurors. `` He was everything because he had money; he had build. He had everything I did n't have. ... He was nice to me. He was like the father I never had. I loved him.'' But <PERSON> Minkow </PERSON> blamed all his troubles on <PERSON> Krowpman </PERSON>, a co-defendant who has pleaded guilty to verifying false ZZZZ Best invoices. <PERSON> Minkow </PERSON> portrayed <PERSON> Krowpman </PERSON> as a 230-pound weight lifter and loan shark with a retinue of muscular thug enforcers. He said <PERSON> Krowpman </PERSON> once tried to sexually molest him. For his $ 1,600 loan, <PERSON> Minkow </PERSON> said <PERSON> Krowpman </PERSON> demanded $ 200-a-week payments plus half the company's profits. Later, he testified, another co-defendant, <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Padgett </PERSON>, demanded 10 percent of the profits for a loan he provided. <PERSON> Minkow </PERSON> said <PERSON> Padgett </PERSON> was `` a Nazi'' who defamed <PERSON> Minkow </PERSON>'s Jewish heritage. `` I felt like I was taking money from the devil,'' said <PERSON> Minkow </PERSON>. He said the pressures for loan shark payments drove him to steal his grandmother's jewelry, and `` I bounced checks everywhere.'' `` I had to pay Krowpman,'' he said. `` That was first. Everything else was second. I went from bank to bank. Nothing else mattered.'' Once, he said, he spoke of calling the police, and <PERSON> Krowpman </PERSON> threatened him. `` What did he say would happen?'' asked <PERSON> Minkow </PERSON>'s lawyer, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Kenner </PERSON>. `` He'd kill me,'' <PERSON> Minkow </PERSON> replied in a near whisper. During pauses in his testimony, <PERSON> Minkow </PERSON> alternately chewed on his fingernails and bit chunks out of a Styrofoam cup. The prosecution has portrayed <PERSON> Minkow </PERSON> as a shrewd con man who knowingly defrauded investors and banks out of about $ 25 million. <PERSON> Kenner </PERSON> has said that <PERSON> Minkow </PERSON> would prove he committed crimes under duress, fearful he would be killed by <PERSON> Krowpman </PERSON> and other mob-connected figures. But <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Dickran </PERSON> <PERSON> Tavrizian </PERSON> barred any mention of organized crime connections Tuesday, saying that `` guilt by association is not permitted.'' <PERSON> Minkow </PERSON> began his testimony by admitting in a halting, soft voice that he had committed the crimes with which he is charged. He frequently paused and cast his eyes downward as he made his admissions. Asked by <PERSON> Kenner </PERSON> whether he had made false claims for his now-defunct business, <PERSON> Minkow </PERSON> replied: `` It's true. I made those claims and they were all lies.'' <PERSON> Minkow </PERSON> is charged with 57 counts, including securities fraud, credit card fraud and mail fraud. Ten of his 12 co-defendants, including <PERSON> Krowpman </PERSON> and <PERSON> Padgett </PERSON>, pleaded guilty. Accountant <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> Rothberg </PERSON> is on trial with <PERSON> Minkow </PERSON>, accused of taking a bribe to cover up ZZZZ Best's frauds. The trial began in August.

 The mayor's dog, Pumpkin, earned a junior policeman's badge for scaring a fleeing suspect onto the roof of an abandoned house and standing guard until help arrived. `` The police chief had some junior police badges, these stick-on deals they give to kids,'' said <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Amos </PERSON>, mayor of this central <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> town. `` He put one on top of her head and made her an official police dog.''

He said Pumpkin chased <PERSON> Huffman </PERSON>, who was hiding in an upstairs utility room, onto the roof. `` He sat out there on the roof, and the dog sat there on the ground and watched him like a squirrel in a tree,'' <PERSON> Amos </PERSON> said.

 A federal judge on Tuesday ordered the promoters of EuroTrim Diet Patches to stop their national advertisements, which feature <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, the president's son, the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 The Archdiocese of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> made a secret out-of-court settlement with a 20-year-old man who sued the church for negligence after he was molested by a <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> priest in the early 1980s, <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> reported today. The newspaper, citing a source it did not identify, said the archdiocese agreed to pay a six-figure sum in the settlement reached Oct. 14. In exchange for the settlement, the plaintiff, who was not identified by name, agreed to the archdiocese's request for a court order sealing the case file to prohibit public disclosure of the evidence or the settlement amount, the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> said. The court order sealing the case was signed by <LOCATION> Montgomery </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, Circuit Judge <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Frosh </PERSON>. The trial on the lawsuit had been scheduled before Frosh next month. The plaintiff was one of three teen-agers sexually abused in the early 1980s by the Rev. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> McCutcheon </PERSON>, who was arrested and pleaded guilty to criminal charges in 1986. The plaintiff, who had sought $ 2 million in damages in <ORGANIZATION> Montgomery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, alleged that church officials `` knew of or should have known'' of <PERSON> McCutcheon </PERSON>'s pedophilia before he was arrested. <PERSON> McCutcheon </PERSON>, who was sentenced to 25 years in prison after pleading guilty to molestation charges, later had the sentence reduced to probation on condition that he move into a church-run treatment center in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>.

 <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' presidential campaign plans to take the unprecedented step of buying television time for his running mate, <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, as part of its final pre-election push. The campaign has purchased a five-minute block of time on the <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> television network on Sunday night and will probably air a spot that <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> tapes late today in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Tad </PERSON> <PERSON> Devine </PERSON>, who coordinates <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>'s campaign for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. `` We want to take full advantage of all the assets we have,'' said <PERSON> Devine </PERSON>, mentioning <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>'s high ratings from the public, especially when combined with the low ratings given his <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> counterpart, <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>. `` The combination of the two is really very powerful,'' he said. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> lately has been attacking the Republicans for negative campaigning and what he calls a character assassination of <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. `` The kind of campaign these Republicans are waging would tear the heart out of a democracy,'' he told a rally Tuesday night in <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Falls </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Mont </PERSON>. The Republicans started right after the Democratic convention with a smear campaign ranging from claiming <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was mentally ill to saying that his wife, <PERSON> Kitty </PERSON>, had burned the flag _ `` All outrageous lies'' _ <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign ads saying that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> would weaken the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military were untrue, he said, as was their claim that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> planned to take guns away from sportsmen. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> has been receiving enthusiastic responses from the crowds where he speaks. More than a thousand people packed the courtyard Tuesday night rally in a casino hotel in <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Falls </LOCATION> and cheered wildly as <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> spoke in front of an enormous American flag and all of the state's top elected Democrats. But in the national news he has been working in the shadows of the two presidential candidates, said his press secretary, <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> McCurry </PERSON>. Increased television exposure, including a planned appearance on the `` CBS Evening News'' tonight and the paid time on Sunday night, could help deliver that message to more of the electorate, he said. `` I think he wants to say something about the campaign and the quality of the campaign,'' <PERSON> McCurry </PERSON> said. `` I think there will be a concentrated effort to make people aware of the broadcast,'' including some paid advertising, he said. Never before has a campaign bought network time for its vice presidential candidate and less than a week ago the campaign was leaning against such a move, <PERSON> Devine </PERSON> said. But the plan fit in with the overall effort by <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> to seek maximum exposure in the final two weeks of the campaign, he said, noting that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' own television schedule was heavier than <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>'s. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> stumped through the <LOCATION> Dakotas </LOCATION> and into <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> on Tuesday. The states have only 10 electoral votes between them. But the Democrats contend they have a good shot at <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> especially, and those states could make the difference in a close election. From states with the fewest electoral votes, <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> was flying today to <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, which at 47 has the most clout in the <ORGANIZATION> Electoral </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>Government-Opposition Talks in Doubt Over Participation of
Activists</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Communist authorities insisted on yet another preliminary meeting with <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> before round-table talks with the opposition can begin, but the Solidarity chairman refused. The dispute arose Tuesday when the government said it wanted to discuss its objection to two Solidarity delegates to the talks, which authorities agreed to in August in return for an end to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s worst labor unrest in seven years. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> said in a telephone interview that he would not agree to the government's demand that he meet today with Interior Minister Gen. <PERSON> Czeslaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Kiszczak </PERSON> on the matter. `` I will not allow any personnel changes,'' he said.'' It could be a precedent, a dangerous precedent for the future. A statement issued later by Solidarity national spokesman <PERSON> Janusz </PERSON> <PERSON> Onyskiewicz </PERSON> ruled out any change in the banned free trade union movement's delegation but expressed hope that the long-awaited talks could begin. <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s planned economy is in crisis, with wages lagging far behind consumer prices, which the government raised by an average of 40 percent earlier this year. A communique issued by the official <ORGANIZATION> PAP </ORGANIZATION> news agency after the ruling Politburo's weekly meeting Tuesday said the government was firmly committed to the talks and expressed hope that `` remaining controversies will be quickly removed in the course of preparatory talks.'' The squabble began when government spokesman <PERSON> Jerzy </PERSON> <PERSON> Urban </PERSON> said a fourth preparatory meeting between <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kiszczak </PERSON> was `` indispensible'' for the talks to begin. The government objects to two people proposed by Solidarity to participate and wants clarification on whether the two _ advisors <PERSON> Jacek </PERSON> <PERSON> Kuron </PERSON> and <PERSON> Adam </PERSON> <PERSON> Michnik </PERSON> _ agree to accept the leading role of the communist party, Urban said. He said <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kiszczak </PERSON> should meet today, and if they settled their differences the talks could begin Friday. Urban charged that Solidarity's `` stubbornness'' was preventing the talks from beginning, but said the Friday date did not represent an ultimatum and the government would be willing to meet later, assuming questions about participation and other technical matters were resolved. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> said he had not given up hope for the talks to bring about `` understanding and the implementation of pluralism,'' but he said another meeting with <PERSON> Kiszczak </PERSON> was unnecessary. Urban said the government has problems with the participation of <PERSON> Kuron </PERSON> and <PERSON> Michnik </PERSON> because the two do n't respect <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s constitutional order, which guarantees the communist party's leading role `` If <PERSON> Jacek </PERSON> <PERSON> Kuron </PERSON> and <PERSON> Adam </PERSON> <PERSON> Michnik </PERSON> really wish to participate in the conciliation process, it would be no problem for them to publicly declare that they respect and will respect the constitutional order,'' he said. <PERSON> Kuron </PERSON> declined comment. A telephone call to <PERSON> Michnik </PERSON>'s home went unanswered. In a first meeting with <PERSON> Kiszczak </PERSON> on Aug. 31, <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> agreed to bring a halt to a wave of strikes after being guaranteed that the talks would address the reinstatement of Solidarity, the only independent labor movement ever allowed in the Soviet bloc. The opposition has demanded that the talks lead to the legalization of Solidarity, which was outlawed after a December 1981 military crackdown. But Polish leader Gen. <PERSON> Wojciech </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON> said Friday he opposes such a move until the economy is healthier and changes in the system allow political demands to be vented outside of trade unions. The government said Monday a specially built round table capable of seating more than 50 people had been set up at its Jablonna Palace in suburban <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> in readiness for the talks. Invited to attend the talks in addition to Solidarity are representatives of the powerful <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>, official trade unions and government-approved social groups.

<HEAD>Amnesty: Death Squad Assassinations Up Sharply Last Two Years In
Salvador</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BEN DOBBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The revival of death squads in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> has resulted in the assassination of hundreds of suspected government opponents during the past two years, <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> said today. The re-emergence of death squads, usually made up of troops and police, coincides with the armed forces' open opposition to the policies of President <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Napoleon </PERSON> <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON>, the London-based human rights organization charged. Members of the clandestine death squads customarily wear plain clothes, use unmarked trucks or vans with tinted windows, and often dump mutilated victims on the roadside `` as a means of terrifying the population,'' it said in a report. Some victims are shot from passing cars in daylight in front of witnesses, while others are seized from their homes or in the street and `` never heard of again'' or turn up in notorious `` body dumps,'' the report said. The death-squad killings `` are routinely carried out by regular units of the armed forces which include the military and the security services, and by special intelligence units that incorporate civilian gunmen under their supervision and control,'' it said. Since early 1987, victims have included trade unionists, human rights workers, returned refugees and members of the judiciary attempting to establish responsibility for human rights violations, the report said. Abductions and attacks have often occurred near police or military installations `` or under the gaze of uniformed security personnel who made no effort to intervene,'' it said. The squads intimidate opponents by publishing `` death lists'' in newspaper advertisements and delivering coffins to the homes of intended victims, the report said. Dumped bodies frequently are found decapitated, dismembered, strangled or showing marks of rape or torture, such as burns and machete wounds, it said. Military authorities abducted and summarily executed tens of thousands of suspected leftists in the late 1970s and early 1980s, but the killings dropped off sharply after <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON>'s U.S.-backed civilian administration came to power in 1984, the report said. The government says the killings are the work of extremists who act independently and can not be apprehended, but <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>'s report said `` evidence gathered over many years from a wide range of sources points to security force responsibility.'' A lava bed 12 miles north of <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> called <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Playon </LOCATION>, where skeletons of bodies devoured by birds of prey were common in the early 1980s, fell into disuse until an unidentified body was found there in January, the report said. Bodies also are again being dumped at a site known as the Devil's Doorway at <LOCATION> Panchimalco </LOCATION>, 12 miles southeast of the capital, the report said In 1987, an average of 12 bodies a month `` showing death squad-style mutilations'' were found dumped along roadsides, it said. It said <PERSON> Tutela </PERSON> <PERSON> Legal </PERSON>, a Roman Catholic human rights group in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, estimates as many death squad-style disappearances and killings occurred in the first quarter of this year as in all of 1987. <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> gave no estimate of the number of death-squad killings over the last six months. Other deliberate killings have been falsely ascribed by armed forces' spokesmen to clashes with opposition forces, the report said. <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> said renewed death-squad killings `` have occurred as the armed forces high command has expressed open opposition'' to <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON>'s policies, including his negotiations with leftist guerrillas. The assassination a year ago of <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Anaya </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanabria </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Salvadoran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, `` was widely interpreted as an attempt to hamper these negotiations,'' the report said. It said reports this summer that <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON> is terminally ill with cancer have been `` another factor affording the armed forces even greater control over counter-insurgency policies.'' The 9-year civil war has killed an estimated 65,000 people, most of them civilians.

 A man who claimed he found a mouse in a can of beer was sentenced to 18 months in prison and apologized after pleading guilty to product tampering and extortion. `` I want to publicly admit that I caused a mouse to be placed in a can of Coors beer and acknowledge the wrongdoing of that act,'' <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON>, 30, said in court Tuesday. Circuit Judge <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON> <PERSON> Olliff </PERSON> gave <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> until Nov. 1 to begin serving his sentence. <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> claimed he discovered the mouse July 27 after taking a few drinks from a 16-ounce can of Coors. He called the Coors' consumer hotline two days later. <ORGANIZATION> Coors </ORGANIZATION> initially offered to pay $ 1,500 for the mouse and the can, but he refused and later asked for $ 35,000. The apology was part of a plea bargain, said Assistant State Attorney <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> McRae </PERSON> <PERSON> Mathis </PERSON>. `` We felt in this case it was appropriate and it was necessary to ensure that the consumer confidence in a consumer product was given back to a company because that is the very thing that was taken away from a company,'' said <PERSON> Mathis </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Adolph </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Golden </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colo. </LOCATION>, will drop a lawsuit against <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> for loss of sales and damage to its reputation, said company spokeswoman <PERSON> Cary </PERSON> <PERSON> Baird </PERSON>. `` Our purpose in filing the lawsuit was not for revenge, but to restore consumer confidence in our products,'' said company President <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Coors </PERSON>. `` We also wanted to send a clear message that product tampering is a serious crime against consumer confidence and trust that will not be tolerated.'' <PERSON> Olliff </PERSON> sentenced <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> to 18 months in prison on each of the two counts and ordered that they be served concurrently.

<TEXT>
 A young man who hit a police officer was ordered jailed for a year and has to write a sentence as part of his sentence: `` People do not have to put up with a jerk like me.'' One hundred times a day for each day behind bars. As part the sentence for 19-year-old <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sommer </PERSON>, Circuit Judge <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoover </PERSON> stayed a 3 -LCB- - year prison term and placed him on five years' probation `` It just seemed to me at the time that if I put this kid in prison, he was going to come out one tough case,'' <PERSON> Hoover </PERSON> explained in an interview Tuesday. The judge said <PERSON> Sommer </PERSON>'s self-image may change if `` he has to suffer the humiliation of being treated like a miscreant junior high schooler'' by having to write the sentence a total of 36,500 times. <PERSON> Sommer </PERSON>, who kicked out a squad car window and was subdued by four officers after being stopped for a traffic violation, pleaded guilty last month to a felony battery charge. <PERSON> Hoover </PERSON> noted during Monday's sentencing that <PERSON> Sommer </PERSON> had shown no remorse. He said he believed prison would offer little chance of rehabilitation for someone who would probably tell fellow inmates he had been convicted of `` beating up a cop.'' `` My basic concern was not to reinforce the image he had of being a tough you-know-what that people had to put up with or suffer the consequences,'' the judge said Tuesday. <PERSON> Sommer </PERSON> was stopped Jan. 31 by <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Watral </PERSON>, Marathon assistant police chief, for speeding. <PERSON> Watral </PERSON> testified during a preliminary hearing that <PERSON> Sommer </PERSON> became upset and used vulgar language when the officer told him he was speeding. The officer said he smelled alcohol on <PERSON> Sommer </PERSON>'s breath and later saw a can of beer in the car. <PERSON> Sommer </PERSON> refused three times to do what the officer asked him to do and `` made a mockery out of the field sobriety test,'' Watral testified. When the officer tried to put handcuffs on the 6-foot-tall <PERSON> Sommer </PERSON>, the man jerked his arm back, hitting the officer across the lower lip, and kicked him in the groin, <PERSON> Watral </PERSON> said. Three other officers had to be called in to subdue <PERSON> Sommer </PERSON>, authorities said. <PERSON> Sommer </PERSON> pleaded guilty to battery in exchange for the state dropping charges of resisting arrest and causing criminal damage to property. He was also cited for drunken driving as a third-time offender and fined $ 1,331.

<TEXT>
 About 3,000 villagers in northern <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION> prayed together to seek protection from the evil spirits they believe caused the mysterious deaths of 13 children this month, a newspaper reported today. Villagers hung pamelo leaves and lemon grass on their front doors to ward off the evil spirits they believe also caused 50 other children to be hospitalized, the Star daily reported from <LOCATION> Baru </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Timah </LOCATION>, about 120 miles north of <LOCATION> Kuala </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lumpur </LOCATION>. They also lit three giant incense sticks and offered food as they chanted prayers at the village marketplace. The mysterious ailment surfaced Oct. 15, and the government has launched a probe to determine what is afflicting the children. Four medical experts from <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION> flew to <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION> Tuesday to help in the investigation. The children vomited blood and experienced diarrhea and fever, and may have been hit with food poisoning, said <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON>, a physician with <LOCATION> Ipoh </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Government </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>, where most of the deaths occurred. Seventeen noodle factories in the area have been ordered closed because many of those stricken had eaten noodles. People in the area have switched to bread, the paper said. Prime Minister <PERSON> Mahathir </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohamad </PERSON> visited nine children who remain hospitalized Monday and said the government was doing its best to determine the cause of the deaths.

<HEAD>Slasher Destroys Huge Pumpkin; Reward Offered For Seeds</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A reward is being offered for the great pumpkin slasher, a vandal who destroyed what was billed as the Midwest's largest gourd and took its valuable seeds, authorities said. The pre-Halloween prank has dumbfounded residents of this upscale suburb north of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, where the 354-pound pumpkin was on display at the posh <ORGANIZATION> Bannockburn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Green </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Retail </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>. The slasher cut the pumpkin and made off with half of it and all the seeds. `` Someone did a very clean job of it,'' <PERSON> Enid </PERSON> <PERSON> Pesmen </PERSON>, property manager of the center, said Tuesday. She bought the pumpkin for $ 200 from a grower in <LOCATION> Nekoosa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wis. </LOCATION>, to use as a Halloween promotion at the center. It was to replace the center's annual pumpkin giveaway, canceled this year because of the drought, said center spokeswoman <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Hill </PERSON>. The grower, <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Keyzer </PERSON>, won the <ORGANIZATION> Midwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pumpkin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weigh-Off </ORGANIZATION> contest earlier this month with the mammoth pumpkin, and agreed to part with it if the seeds were returned to him, Ms. <PERSON> Hill </PERSON> said. The center had planned to keep the pumpkin on display outdoors until Halloween, then offer it to bakeries to make pies for the hungry, Ms. <PERSON> Hill </PERSON> said. But during the weekend, the slasher struck. Workmen found the remains of the pumpkin Saturday night. Mrs. <PERSON> Pesmen </PERSON> said she has no idea who might have pulled such a stunt. `` I assume they really wanted the seeds,'' she said. She has offered a reward of about $ 100 for return of the seeds, but has little hope of finding the thief. `` I do n't know how we're going to find someone with half a pumpkin and seeds,'' she said. The mystery may not be identified until next growing season, if a patch of giant pumpkins crops up in <LOCATION> Bannockburn </LOCATION>. `` That's what we're going to be on the look-out for,'' Ms. <PERSON> Pesmen </PERSON> said.

 A state lawmaker vowed to seek wages, guns and even <ORGANIZATION> Confederate </ORGANIZATION> flags from 11 Klansmen to collect his share of a $ 1 million award to civil rights marchers pelted with rocks in nearly all-white <LOCATION> Forsyth </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>. A federal jury found the <PERSON> Ku </PERSON> <PERSON> Klux </PERSON> <PERSON> Klansmen </PERSON> and two white supremacist groups responsible for disrupting the Jan. 17, 1987, march north of <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, and awarded $ 948,650 in damages to 49 demonstrators who filed suit. `` It is a message to the <ORGANIZATION> Ku </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Klux </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Klan </ORGANIZATION> nationwide that this can happen to you,'' said state Rep. J.E. `` Billy'' <PERSON> McKinney </PERSON>, one of the demonstrators. <PERSON> McKinney </PERSON> said he and the other plaintiffs `` are determined we will get every dime that we can get out of the Klan.'' The award, the second major one involving a Klan organization in two years, includes $ 400,000 each from the Southern White Knights of the <ORGANIZATION> Ku </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Klux </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Klan </ORGANIZATION> and the Invisible Empire Knights of the <ORGANIZATION> Ku </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Klux </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Klan </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Holland </PERSON>, grand dragon of the Southern White Knights, was ordered to pay $ 50,000, the highest of the 11 defendants. `` I guarantee if -LRB- <LOCATION> Holland </LOCATION>'s -RRB- got a pickup truck, I'm going to take it. If he's got a shotgun in the back -LRB- of the truck -RRB-, I'm going to take it, too _ and I want his Confederate flag,'' <PERSON> McKinney </PERSON> said. Defense attorneys were stunned by the verdict unsealed Tuesday and said they would appeal. <PERSON> Holland </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> Jeffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Sliz </PERSON>, called it `` grossly unreasonable.'' Another defense attorney, <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Plaginos </PERSON>, said the plaintiffs had no proof for any injury that would mandate such severe damages. `` They did not prove anybody was hurt, literally, or lost wages, anything. They did not prove anything,'' she said. She said that within 30 days she would ask <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Moye </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> to dismiss or lower the damages. The jury reached its verdict Oct. 5, agreeing that the violence amounted to a violation of the marchers' civil right. <PERSON> Moye </PERSON> ordered the verdict sealed until Tuesday to give those who brought the lawsuit time to decide whether to join City Councilman <PERSON> Hosea </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, who wanted to drop it. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, who helped organize the march and was among those who filed the lawsuit, urged toward the end of the trial that the suit be dropped because it would impoverish the families of <ORGANIZATION> KKK </ORGANIZATION> members. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said he has forgiven the Klan `` and other white supremacists for brutalizing us'' during the march. There had been 57 plaintiffs. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> and three others dropped out during the trial and four others dropped out Tuesday. The jury awarded $ 50 to each plaintiffs in compensatory damages. The rest was in punitive damages. The lawsuit had sought $ 1.5 million. One defendant was found not liable. <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Stephens </PERSON>, grand dragon of the Invisible Empire Knights, was ordered to pay $ 30,000 but he said the marchers may have a hard time collecting it. `` If the $ 30,000 holds up, and I do n't feel that it will hold up, they would play the devil getting it,'' <PERSON> Stephens </PERSON> said. `` I do n't have anything such as that. <PERSON> Stephens </PERSON>, an electrician, said he rents his home. The march was a forerunner to a larger demonstration a week later in which an estimated 24,000 people turned out. State, local, county and federal troops were called out to protect the marchers and prevent violence. In February 1987, an all-white federal jury in <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> awarded a black woman, <ORGANIZATION> Beulah </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mae </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Donald </ORGANIZATION>, $ 7 million from the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Klans </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and six members or former members of the group after her son, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Donald </PERSON>, was beaten, strangled and hanged in a tree in 1981 at age 19. Attorney <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> <PERSON> Dees </PERSON>, who represented marchers in the <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> case, was also an attorney for the family in the <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> case.

In his presidential campaign, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has denounced the administration for its `` failed and illegal'' policy of supporting Nicaraguan rebels, and he said sending Guard troops to the region was an attempt to intimidate <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, who was campaigning Tuesday in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>, had no immediate comment on the appellate decision. A press aide, <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Crawford </PERSON>, said the governor was disappointed that the court chose not to uphold the `` important principle'' of state authority. State Attorney General <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Shannon </PERSON>, who represented <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> in court, said he would wait until another federal appeals court rules in a similar challenge before deciding whether to appeal to the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Bolton </PERSON>, chief of the civil division in the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, said he was pleased by the ruling: `` It represents the complete vindication of the administration's position.'' After <PERSON> Keeton </PERSON> issued his ruling in May, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> appealed but did not try to stop the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> troops from participating in the exercises, which involved road-building. In his decision, <PERSON> Keeton </PERSON> explicitly upheld the constitutionality of the Montgomery Amendment, a 1986 act of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> that says governors may not decline such assignments `` because of any objection to the location, purpose, type or schedule of such activity.'' `` At issue in this case is the constitutional status of the modern <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Keeton </PERSON> wrote, framing his question in terms of competing clauses in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Constitution that divided control over the new nation's militia between the federal government and the states. Lawyers for the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> argued that the `` Army Clause'' in the Constitution gives <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> the ultimate say over the nation's entire military apparatus. They described <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' position as `` a dagger aimed at the heart of national defense. The <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>' attorney general's office, representing <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, had claimed that the `` Militia Clause'' reserved power to the governors over training the militia. Assistant Attorney General <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilkins </PERSON> stressed the `` original intent'' of the Constitution's framers, arguing that state control over the `` militia'' was essentially undisturbed by the many reorganizations of the nation's military. <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Rudy </PERSON> <PERSON> Perpich </PERSON>, joined by <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> and nine other states, challenged the law last year in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paul </LOCATION> and lost. The case is now on appeal.

<HEAD>First Lady Calls For Punishment of Wall Street Bankers Who Use
Cocaine</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By VICTORIA GRAHAM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has called for an all-out domestic war on drug users, saying Wall Street bankers who use cocaine should be punished along with dealers, smugglers and Colombian drug kingpins. <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> _ not foreign drug producers _ bears responsibility for its narcotics problem, the First Lady said in a speech Tuesday at the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>. Each American drug user, she said, `` is an accomplice to every criminal act, every murder, every terrorist attack carried out by the narcotics syndicates.'' `` To get serious about stopping illegal drugs,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said, `` that means confronting all those citizens who use drugs.'' If the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> can not choke off the demand for drugs, she said, there is little hope of halting production and smuggling. `` It is often easier to make strong speeches about foreign drug lords or drug smugglers,'' she said, `` than to arrest a pair of Wall Street investment bankers buying cocaine on their lunch break.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> made the comments in a speech to the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Third Committee on Social and Humanitarian Affairs. In 1985, she and other first ladies addressed an international conference against drug abuse at the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> when she sounded her anti-drug slogan: `` Just Say No.'' In his eight years in office, President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has advocated a war on drug producers in <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and elsewhere, as well as the interdiction of drugs smuggled into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. But the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> administration has been criticized for its dealings with Panamanian strongman Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, indicted in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for drug trafficking, and for not cracking down on governments that allow domestic drug production. In her speech, Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> emphasized the need for police to arrest and for courts to punish all drug users. It is as important to stop drug use in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, she said, as it is to stop coca-growing in <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>, processing in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> and shipping through the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION>. `` It is the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> alone which bears responsibility for its own drug problem,'' she said. `` While most of the illegal drugs are imported, the drug users are home-grown.'' `` If we lack the will to fully mobilize the forces of law in our own country to arrest and punish drug users, if we can not stem the American demand for drugs,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said, `` Then there will be little hope of preventing foreign drug producers from fulfilling that demand.''

 Two women who were pen pals with <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> and her sister have sold the correspondence at auction for $ 150,000 and plan to use the money to retire and to fund an organization for Christian missionaries. The anonymous buyer, who also paid a 10 percent fee to the auction house, will give the letters to the <ORGANIZATION> Simon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wiesenthal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, according to <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>. The women had hoped the buyer would put the letters, which are in English, in a setting where they can be viewed publicly. `` We enjoyed them for 48 years, and we're just hoping that maybe the world will get to see them,'' said <PERSON> Betty </PERSON> <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Wagner </PERSON>. Miss <PERSON> Wagner </PERSON> and her sister <PERSON> Juanita </PERSON> wrote to <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> and her sister, <PERSON> Margot </PERSON>, in 1940 at the suggestion of a teacher in their then-hometown of <LOCATION> Danville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>. At the time, <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> and <PERSON> Juanita </PERSON> were 11; <PERSON> Margot </PERSON> and <PERSON> Betty </PERSON> <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> were 15. <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> and <PERSON> Margot </PERSON> sent back two photographs, a postcard and two letters describing their life in <LOCATION> Amsterdam </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Holland </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Margot </PERSON> wrote that `` having a frontier with <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and being a small country we never feel safe.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Wagners </ORGANIZATION> wrote back, but never heard from the Franks again. A month after the letters were sent, <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> invaded the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION>. The Franks, who were Jewish, went into hiding in the attic of a house in <LOCATION> Amsterdam </LOCATION> but were later discovered and sent to concentration camps. <PERSON> Anne </PERSON>'s diary, published in 1952, carries a poignant account of their life in hiding. `` We'd worried about her during the war, but never dreamed she was suffering,'' said <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Wagner </PERSON>, reached at her home in the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> area. She added that she and her sister, who also lives in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, hope to visit the house in <LOCATION> Amsterdam </LOCATION> where the <PERSON> Franks </PERSON> hid. After the war, the <ORGANIZATION> Wagners </ORGANIZATION> wrote to the Franks again. <PERSON> Anne </PERSON>'s father replied to say that he was the only one in his family to survive the war <PERSON> Rhonda </PERSON> <PERSON> Barad </PERSON>, director of the Wiesenthal center's eastern region, said the letters would be exhibited at a new museum in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> when it is completed next year. `` We wanted the letters,'' said <PERSON> Barad </PERSON>, whose organization is named for the famed Nazi hunter. `` The focus of the center is to teach tolerance and that's what <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>'s diary and her life represent.'' Miss <PERSON> Wagner </PERSON> said she plans to donate part of the money from the sale to <ORGANIZATION> Wayfarer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministries </ORGANIZATION>, a non-profit organization she founded nine years ago to help <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> missionaries around the world. The auction house, <PERSON> Swann </PERSON> <PERSON> Galleries </PERSON>, had predicted that bidding would exceed $ 30,000 but could not estimate how high it would go because nothing written by <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> had ever been auctioned before. Among the bidders was actress <PERSON> Whoopi </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldberg </PERSON>, one of hundreds who participated in the auction by telephone. Also sold at the auction were several <PERSON> Marilyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Monroe </PERSON> autographs, including her certificate of conversion to <ORGANIZATION> Judaism </ORGANIZATION>, which took place just before her marriage to playwright <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>. The certificate was bought by a private collector for $ 7,000, said <PERSON> Will </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>, a <PERSON> Swann </PERSON> spokesman. A handwritten letter of condolence from <PERSON> Emily </PERSON> <PERSON> Dickinson </PERSON> to the husband of a friend who died was on the auction block as well, bringing $ 8,000 from a dealer. Seventy-six pages of handwritten notes by <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Edison </PERSON> brought $ 32,000. <PERSON> Edison </PERSON> compiled the manuscript, which concerns his travels, jobs and inventions, for use by his official biographers, <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> said.

 A once-respected defense lawyer committed `` depraved murder'' by beating his illegally adopted 6-year-old daughter and doing nothing to save her life, a prosecutor said in the attorney's murder trial. Assistant District Attorney <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Casolaro </PERSON> made the opening statement Tuesday as <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON>'s biological mother, <PERSON> Michele </PERSON> <PERSON> Launders </PERSON>, sobbed in the courtroom's front row. The girl's death nearly a year ago drew national attention and made her a symbol of the plight of abused children. `` As <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> lay unconscious, the defendant did absolutely nothing,'' <PERSON> Casolaro </PERSON> said, adding evidence showed prompt medical care would have saved the child's life. <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON>'s `` failure to act constituted depraved murder,'' <PERSON> Casolaro </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON>, 47, is charged with second-degree murder in the death of the child he took illegally at birth from Ms. Launders, then an unmarried <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> teen-ager. He has denied ever hitting <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON>. <PERSON> Casolaro </PERSON> said `` graphic and grotesque'' evidence and testimony would prove <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> murdered <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON>, who was found unconscious at the <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> apartment in <LOCATION> Greenwich </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Village </LOCATION> early Nov. 2, and died three days later. The first-grader had bruises on her chest, legs, arms and neck, and head injuries caused by `` blunt-force trauma'' when she arrived at the hospital, <PERSON> Casolaro </PERSON> told the state jury. Police officers noticed <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON>'s bleeding knuckles, he said. <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON>'s attorney, <LOCATION> Ira </LOCATION> <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, said in his opening that the evidence would not support a murder charge and called on the jury to acquit his client. `` It will not be proven in this case that <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> was murdered, nor will it be proven that <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> was a battered child,'' <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> said. `` <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> was neither sullen or withdrawn. She was a vital, active and engaging child until her death.'' <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> has said <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> became sick the night of Nov. 1 after eating and that the bruises on her back and chest resulted from his efforts to revive her after she fell unconscious. No help was called for <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> until after 6:30 a.m. on Nov. 2, court records show. <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> on Tuesday attacked <PERSON> Hedda </PERSON> <PERSON> Nussbaum </PERSON>, <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON>'s longtime live-in companion, who Judge <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Rothwax </PERSON> called `` the single most important witness in this case.'' Ms. <PERSON> Nussbaum </PERSON> has an agreement with the district attorney's office to testify, although she has told prosecutors she did not see <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> strike <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> the day she fell unconscious. Ms. <PERSON> Nussbaum </PERSON> was charged in <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON>'s death, but was never indicted and the charges will probably be dropped, the district attorney's office said After her arrest, she underwent surgery and psychiatric treatment for injuries allegedly inflicted by <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON>. <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> called Ms. <PERSON> Nussbaum </PERSON> `` delusional'' and pointed out that she had spent the last year in a mental hospital. `` Undoubtedly, you will hear witnesses refer to <PERSON> Hedda </PERSON>'s self-destructive romance with satanic cults, her sadomasochistic behavior outside the home and her involvement with pornography,'' <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> said <PERSON> Casolaro </PERSON> painted Ms. <PERSON> Nussbaum </PERSON> as another victim of <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON>. `` He exploited her weakness of mind and her emotional problems,'' the prosecutor said. `` The defendant beat and broke Miss <PERSON> Nussbaum </PERSON> until she had become nothing more than his willing servant.'' One of the trial's first witnesses, paramedic <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Filangeri </PERSON>, testified that Ms. <PERSON> Nussbaum </PERSON> was in such bad shape the night of the death she appeared to be `` 70 to 80 years of age.'' Ms. <PERSON> Nussbaum </PERSON> is 46. Police Officer <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Botte </PERSON>, the first person to arrive at the apartment and see the unconscious girl, testified the home was dirty, unkempt and dark when he arrived. A 16-month-old boy, <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, was found in the apartment sitting in a dirty diaper and tethered to a playpen, authorities have said. The boy was also illegally adopted, and now lives with his biological mother. The trial is to resume Thursday.

 <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Customs </ORGANIZATION> released a $ 14 million Eastern jetliner after the airline put up a line of credit for a $ 896,000 fine levied after 56 pounds of cocaine was found on board. The airline said it would appeal the fine, along with $ 13 million in fines for drugs discovered on other Eastern aircraft. The L-1011 departed <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> for <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> on Tuesday night, hours after the plane was released. In addition to the line of credit, <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> agreed to increase drug security, said company spokeswoman <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> Ceremsak </PERSON>. Since August, 494 pounds of cocaine has been discovered on four Eastern planes, including the craft seized Monday after a flight from <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>. Agents discovered the cocaine in an orange nylon <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Mail bag, bearing a luggage tag. Eastern officials said Tuesday that they were not aware of any arrests related to the seizure. `` We provided information about the possible shipment of drugs and we're being punished for providing the information,'' said <PERSON> Ceremsak </PERSON>. But Customs spokesman <PERSON> Clif </PERSON> <PERSON> Stallings </PERSON> said Tuesday the airline was not involved in any of the drug investigations. `` We have no information from them at all about that seizure or any of the preceding three in the past two months,'' he said. <PERSON> Abraham </PERSON> <PERSON> Azzam </PERSON>, formerly a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> agent, now <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s top drug security officer, said the airline is spending $ 3 million on security, but drug traffickers will continue using airliners. `` Certainly cocaine is going to continue to come out of <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>,'' he said. <PERSON> Azzam </PERSON> estimated the seizure of the 293-seat jet cost the airline $ 40,000 to $ 50,000 a day. <ORGANIZATION> Avianca </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> stopped cargo flights from <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> four months ago because of millions of dollars in fines it has been forced to pay in this country as a result of cocaine shipments.

 A <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Border Patrol car was mistaken for a possible drug smuggler by an <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> helicopter that crashed as it swooped down for a closer look, killing all eight aboard, officials said. The helicopter was taking part in the first mission of Operation Border Ranger, a joint anti-drug smuggling program of six <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> sheriff's departments and the federal goverment along the U.S.-Mexico border, <LOCATION> Imperial </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sheriff </LOCATION>'s Lt. <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Koon </PERSON> said Tuesday. The program has been suspended temporarily until the crash investigation is completed by personnel from the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rucker </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ala. </LOCATION>, and the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>, said <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> Maj. <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Mensik </PERSON>. `` We're not going to stop the program -LRB- because of the crash -RRB-. We'll proceed as long as the law enforcement agencies want to,'' he said. Monday night's fiery crash occurred when the five lawmen and three guardsmen aboard the UH-1H helicopter noticed a vehicle with its lights off parked on a remote access road off Interstate 8, about 70 miles east of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION>. `` They were in the process of descending to get a closer look at the suspect vehicle. Apparently, at about 500 feet, they struck a power line that had been strung between two hilltops,'' <PERSON> Mensik </PERSON> said. `` We discovered later that it was a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Border Patrol vehicle with at least one agent inside. He later offered assistance at the crash.'' The Border Patrol agents knew about the program, but had no radio contact with the agents in the air, <PERSON> Mensik </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Musegades </PERSON>, chief patrol agent for the <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Centro </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Border </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Patrol </ORGANIZATION> section, said it's common practice for his agents to park and dim their car lights while on patrol. The car was parked in a canyon that separates the eastbound and westbound lanes of the freeway, about 30 miles west of <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Centro </LOCATION>, he said. <PERSON> Koon </PERSON> said the helicopter smashed into the rocky foothills of the <LOCATION> Laguna </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountains </LOCATION> and burst into flames after striking the 500,000 kilowatt power line. The victims, including five sheriff's deputies from four <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> counties, died instantly when the fire broke out, according to the sheriff's department. Ocotillo is 40 miles west of <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Centro </LOCATION> and less than 10 miles from the U.S.-Mexican border.

 Chanting anti-government and anti-U.S. slogans, radical students today threw firebombs and rocks at three government buildings and a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> cultural center, police and news reports said. About 100 students directed their attack on the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> building in the southern city of <LOCATION> Taegu </LOCATION>, police and the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> said. It was the third attack on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> offices in two weeks. The embassy said in a statement that the assailants threw stones and firebombs, which did not explode, and dispersed police guarding the center. The students seized the center's signboard and fled when police reinforcements arrived and fired tear gas, it said. There were no injuries, but windows at the center were broken, and a <ORGANIZATION> USIS </ORGANIZATION> car and two other cars in the parking lot were slightly damaged, the embassy said. <PERSON> Yonhap </PERSON>, the South Korean news agency, said assailants also firebombed a police building near the center, shattering 10 windows. The agency said bands of students carrying firebombs and clubs also attacked a government party building and a government prosecutors' office in downtown <LOCATION> Taegu </LOCATION>, smashing windows and destroying two cars. At least one student was injured. <PERSON> Yonhap </PERSON> said students were demanding the arrest of former President <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> <PERSON> Doo-hwan </PERSON>, who is under parliamentary investigation for alleged corruption. The radicals also demand the withdrawal of about 42,000 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops stationed in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> under a mutual defense pact, contending the presence of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops hampers unification of the <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> <LOCATION> peninsula </LOCATION>, which has been divided since 1945. Police have tightened security around the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION>, cultural centers and other American government facilities because of the current anti-U.S. campaign, which has been on the rise since the Olympic Games ended Oct. 2. On Oct. 14, students injured 13 policemen and razed a police bus in a firebomb attack on a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> cultural center in the southern city of <LOCATION> Kwangju </LOCATION>. About 21 students hurled firebombs at a U.S.O. building near downtown <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> on Friday, a week after a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> soldier and three Koreans were injured in a group fight involving dozens of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> soldiers and <LOCATION> Koreans </LOCATION> near <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military headquarters in southern <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>.

 A man who believed his roommate infected him with the AIDS virus was sentenced to 28 years in prison for killing the man. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Ford </PERSON>, 31, testified at his sentencing hearing that he moved in with former <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> Sgt. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wiggins </PERSON> in March with the sole intent of killing <PERSON> Wiggins </PERSON> after learning he tested positive for the AIDS virus. `` I confronted -LRB- <PERSON> Wiggins </PERSON> -RRB-.

<HEAD>Britain To Keep Pints And Miles, But Metric System On Its Way</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL WEST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The government has pledged to keep the pint and the mile but says that from gills and gallons to feet and fathoms, virtually all the rest of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s traditional weights and measures system will vanish in the 1990s. Detailing the latest draft directive from the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> on converting <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> to continental <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s metric system, Corporate Affairs Minister <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> <PERSON> Maude </PERSON> said Tuesday that the government sees no grounds for making unnecessary changes. `` We're not going to have to re-measure the cricket pitch,'' he declared in a statement designed to reassure Britons over the planned conversion to the metric system. Cricket pitches will indeed stay the same length, 22 yards. But measurements in yards, inches and feet will be phased out by the end of 1994 and replaced by meters, centimeters and millimeters under the terms of the draft directive. The directive was issued by the Brussels-based executive commission of the 12-nation <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION>, to which <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> belongs. Other units from what is known as <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s imperial system of weights and measures that will vanish under the terms of the draft directive include the gill, the fluid ounce, and the fathom. A gill is the equivalent of a quarter pint. A fluid ounce is a measure of capacity containing an avoirdupois ounce of distilled water at 62 degrees. The fathom -LRB- six feet -RRB-, which is used to measure ocean depths, is already being phased out by the <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> but its use will be allowed until 1999. <PERSON> Maude </PERSON> said the draft directive was broadly acceptable to the government. It provides for exemption of the traditional pint for draught beer and cider in pubs and for milk in returnable bottles, and for the troy ounce. The troy ounce, used to measure gold and other precious metals, is crucial to London-based bullion trading operations. <PERSON> Maude </PERSON> said that to avoid wasting an estimated 1.2 billion returnable bottles in circulation for drinks other than milk, the government is seeking arrangements to allow the continued use of imperial-measure bottles until the end of 1999. He said the government is also committed to keeping the mile as a measure for distance and speed on signposts and speedometers. He said the furlong, a distance used in horse racing, would also stay because it was used only in a sporting context and was therefore not covered by the draft directive. A furlong is an eighth of a mile. But for trade in fruit, vegetables, meat and other items the pound and the ounce will be replaced by the kilogram and the gram. In 1965, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> first committed itself to going metric _ the system devised by the <ORGANIZATION> Paris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION> in 1791 which is now in force throughout continental <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. British youngsters learn the metric system at school, many goods in British supermarkets show both the metric and traditional British measure side by side, and some business like measuring materials in dry goods stores is done entirely in the metric system. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s traditional system stems from its days of empire when it turned its back of continental <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and went its own way. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> joined the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> in 1973. `` This does not mean that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kingdom </LOCATION> will suddenly lose all its imperial traditions but it does mean that over the next five or six years we will see some changes in the way goods are sold in the shops,'' <PERSON> Maude </PERSON> said. `` In matters which are entirely domestic to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kingdom </LOCATION> we see no reason why we can not continue to use imperial units where they are customary,'' he added. There have been efforts to put the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> on the metric system for more than a decade, including 1975 legislation. But progress has been slow. Not everyone is thrilled with the idea, especially some powerful business lobbying groups. Under a law enacted in August, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government is required to start doing business with its private suppliers under the metric system starting in 1992.

 A lower-ranking diplomat at <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>'s embassy was assassinated on the steps of his apartment building, <LOCATION> Ankara </LOCATION> Gov <PERSON> Saffet </PERSON> <PERSON> Arikan </PERSON> <PERSON> Beduk </PERSON> said today. <PERSON> Beduk </PERSON> said <PERSON> Abdulgani </PERSON> <PERSON> Bedawi </PERSON> was shot to death by unknown gunmen Tuesday night in front of his apartment building in affluent <LOCATION> Cankaya </LOCATION> district. <PERSON> Bedawi </PERSON>, who was returning from the office, died instantly from shots to the head and chest, <PERSON> Beduk </PERSON> said. There was no immediate claim of responsibility. Saudi Arabian Ambassador <PERSON> Abdulaziz </PERSON> <PERSON> Khojah </PERSON> said the `` killing could not possibly be a result of personal conflict or for burglary.'' He said, however, that the embassy had received more than 100 threatening letters written in Turkish during the spring holy pilgrimage season. `` I do n't believe the Turks have anything to do with the incident even though the letters were in Turkish,'' <PERSON> Khojah </PERSON> said without elaborating. <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> restricted the number of Moslems who could visit the country during the pilgrimage season this year according to each Moslem nation's population. The decision was taken as a security measure after last year's riot by Iranians during the pilgrimage to Mecca that claimed the lives of more than 400 Iranians <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> broke diplomatic ties with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> in April. The <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> government then announced that the decision had several reasons, among them the clash in <LOCATION> Mecca </LOCATION> and a subsequent attack on the Saudi embassy in <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Khojah </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bedawi </PERSON> worked as a telex operator in the embassy.

<HEAD>Despite Leaky Gloves, AIDS Infection Unlikely Through Skin Contact</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Doctors and nurses face a one-in-a-thousand risk of catching AIDS when they get infected blood or other body fluids on their skin, even though gloves they wear for protection often leak, studies found. `` Gloves have been leaking for years, we've been wearing them and we have n't found a lot of infections in hospital employees'' exposed to AIDS, hepatitis B and other viruses, said <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> DeGroot-Kosolcharoen </PERSON>, an infection control nurse at <ORGANIZATION> Middleton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Memorial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Veterans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Madison </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wis. </LOCATION>. Three studies conducted by <PERSON> DeGroot-Kosolcharoen </PERSON> and researchers in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> found leakage in more than half of some of the brands of gloves tested One study was conducted as an eighth-grade science project by a student whose father is an infectious disease expert. The studies found wide variations in leakage rates for various brands of latex and vinyl gloves, but tended to show sterile surgical gloves less leak-prone than non-sterile examination gloves, and latex less leak-prone than vinyl. A fourth study concluded blood, sputum, urine and other body fluids of AIDS patients gets on the skin of health care workers `` far too frequently,'' with about one-quarter of a group of 770 hospital employees getting AIDS-tainted liquids on their skin. But the chance of one such exposure infecting a person with the virus for acquired immune deficiency syndrome is no more than 1.1 in 1,000, said <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Fahey </PERSON>, an infection control specialist who performed the study at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institutes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Clinical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Bethesda </LOCATION>, Md. A related study by <ORGANIZATION> NIH </ORGANIZATION> epidemiologist <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Henderson </PERSON> found health care workers face a one in 250 chance of catching AIDS from a single instance of being jabbed by a contaminated needle, and a one in 300 chance of being infected if virus-tainted liquid comes in contact with their mucous membranes. `` There really is a risk we all have to swallow. It's a bitter pill,'' <PERSON> Henderson </PERSON> said Tuesday during the 28th Interscience Conference on Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy. However, the <ORGANIZATION> NIH </ORGANIZATION> studies showed health care workers got AIDS-tainted fluids on their skin far more often than they contacted such liquids through their mucous membranes or needle injuries. Researchers at the conference said hospital workers should check gloves for holes before using them, then wash their hands after removing gloves. <PERSON> DeGroot-Kosolcharoen </PERSON> said recommendations for health care workers to wear gloves to protect themselves from AIDS and other viruses caused a nationwide glove shortage and that `` manufacturers have had difficulty supplying enough gloves without compromising quality.'' She performed water-leak tests on 2,400 gloves from 24 brands of gloves. In a second test, the gloves were donned by researchers and dipped in blood they donated. Of the 24 brands, only four did n't leak at all. They were sterile latex gloves. Up to 52 percent of gloves in some brands leaked, <PERSON> DeGroot-Kosolcharoen </PERSON> said. Average leak rates for water and blood, respectively, were 1.1 percent and 1.1 percent for sterile latex, 9 percent and 9.5 percent for sterile vinyl, 14 percent and 9 percent for non-sterile latex, and _ most leaky _ 17.7 percent and 10.3 percent for non-sterile vinyl. <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> infection control research director <PERSON> Helen </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosen </PERSON> <PERSON> Kotilainen </PERSON> tested 1,200 vinyl and 1,750 latex non-sterile examination gloves from seven brands. Water-leak rates for ranged from 4 percent to 28 percent for vinyl brands and from 0 percent to 6 percent for latex brands.

 President <PERSON> Chadli </PERSON> <PERSON> Benjedid </PERSON> has rejected transition to a multi-party democracy as part of political reforms announced after bloody riots earlier this month. In a communique issued by his office Monday night, <ORGANIZATION> Benjedid </ORGANIZATION> said the ruling party, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, would become more democratic and party officials would be made more accountable to the rank and file. The communique said the party had to `` listen more atentively to the people to understand their concerns'' The unrest, spurred by <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION>'s economic crisis, began with demonstrators protesting food shortages and rising prices. The party, which has ruled the country since independence from <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> in 1962, was already unpopular and has been silent since the disturbances, which left 159 people dead and 154 injured, according to official figures. Unofficial estimates at the time put the number of dead at 400 or more. The communique said, `` a multi-system can not be established with groups who seek power and privileges under the facade of democracy.'' However, the communique said, rejuvenation of the ruling party does not exclude the possibility that eventually there could be a pluralistic system. It said there will be elections to most party posts and non-members could run for election to popular assemblies. The measures are to be put before a party congress in December and then to a referendum next year. In another referendum next week, Algerians will vote on a plan to make the prime minister answerable to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>.

The movie, entitled `` Kink's Calypso,'' chronicles the 9-year-old dog's fantasy visit to <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>, where he sips multicolored drinks with little umbrellas. The film festival, sponsored by Come' N Get It dog food, drew about 400 entries. Other winners included Checkers, a black-and-white mixed breed who captured best performance by a dog in a video. As <PERSON> Elvis </PERSON> sang, `` I Did It My Way,'' Checkers knocked people down, stole food and bit mail carriers, among other things. <PERSON> Lepky </PERSON>, from the husky-malamute family, won best canine comedy for taking Fifi, a French poodle, on a drive in a sports car while the Beach Boys sing, `` Little Deuce Coupe.''

 A candidate for secretary of state said there would be no more name-calling in his campaign one day after calling his opponent a `` fairy queen.'' <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sheppard </PERSON> said his comment about <ORGANIZATION> Oregon </ORGANIZATION> Secretary of State <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> at a news conference was aimed at her opposition to a ballot issue but was misunderstood. The measure would repeal Gov. <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldschmidt </PERSON>'s executive order barring state agenices from discrimination based on sexual preference. Repeal supporters say <PERSON> Goldschmidt </PERSON>'s order grants homosexuals special protection, even though it also applies to heterosexuals. <PERSON> Sheppard </PERSON> had called <PERSON> Goldschmidt </PERSON> a `` bozo'' for issuing the order, and said Monday that if `` <PERSON> Goldschmidt </PERSON> is the chief bozo, <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> can be crowned the fairy queen.''

 Police and soldiers conducted body searches on black voters outside <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION> as <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africans </LOCATION> of all races voted today in segregated municipal elections. President P.W. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>'s ruling party was expected to lose ground to extreme right-wing opponents in white cities, and a light turnout was reported in black townships where anti-apartheid activists urged a vote boycott in defiance of the government's state of emergency regulations. State Radio <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> reported 1,946 candidates for the 7,229 town council seats were elected unopposed. It noted fewer than half the 1,839 black township council seats were being contested, with no candidates for 138 seats. Black, white, Asian and mixed-race voters cast ballots today, marking the first time all four major race groups in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> voted on the same day. Anti-apartheid activists such as Archbishop <PERSON> Desmond </PERSON> <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON>, winner of the 1984 Nobel Peace Prize, called for a national day of protest today. Such calls usually include a general strike. But most black townships appeared normal except for heightened police patrols and the presence of armed security forces around polling booths and transportation facilities. Police said gasoline bombs were thrown during the night at the homes of three candidates in <LOCATION> Soweto </LOCATION>, the country's largest black township, outside <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION>. Also, a limpet mine exploded in a beer hall in <LOCATION> Soweto </LOCATION>, but there were no injuries. Two black candidates had been killed during the campaign, one Monday night outside <LOCATION> Port </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Elizabeth </LOCATION>, the other in August in <LOCATION> Soweto </LOCATION>. Many schools in <LOCATION> Soweto </LOCATION> were closed because of poor attendance, officials said, and black students writing exams in <LOCATION> Umlazi </LOCATION> outside <LOCATION> Durban </LOCATION> were fired on. Buses and trains were stoned in the black township of <LOCATION> Claremont </LOCATION> outside <LOCATION> Durban </LOCATION>. Voting was extremely slow in many black areas around <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION>, with one or two voters showing up by midday at some polling places. But poll workers said more than 1,000 voters turned out in <LOCATION> Khayelitsha </LOCATION>, where police were seen conducting body searches of people entering the polling area. Critics say black turnout figures this year will be virtually meaningless because millions of blacks are ineligible to vote and no candidates linked to major anti-apartheid groups are running. Most leading opposition groups are banned, and most activists view black town councils as subservient extensions of the white-controlled central government. Truckloads of police were posted at the polling booth in <LOCATION> Mayfair </LOCATION>, a white suburb of <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION> where non-whites have begun living illegally. In <LOCATION> Soweto </LOCATION>, police with rifles stood around polling booths; soldiers and police on motorcycles and horses were stationed near the police station. Bombings and hand grenade attacks have averaged more than one a day in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> since September. Police say the attacks are part of a campaign by the outlawed <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> guerrilla movement to disrupt the elections. A car bomb killed three black men and injured 18 on Monday in the town of <LOCATION> Witbank </LOCATION>, east of <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION>. On Tuesday, riot police used tear gas and clubs to disperse more than 1,000 activists at <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Witwatersrand </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION> who were calling for an election boycott. There were no injuries in that incident, but about 30 high school students in <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION> similarly protesting the elections suffered slight injuries in a clash Tuesday with club-wielding police, school officials said. The government had sought a high turnout to bolster its claim that it is `` broadening democracy'' in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. In the white elections, <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> was in a showdown with the staunchly pro-apartheid <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. The Conservatives were predicting they could capture the city council in <LOCATION> Pretoria </LOCATION>, the capital. The Conservatives, who see <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>'s gradual race reforms as capitulation to the black majority, seek to reimpose strict segregation throughout <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. The Conservatives won 26 percent of the vote in the national elections of May 1987, and claim they could seriously challenge the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> in parliamentary elections expected by early 1990. In the black elections, less than 500,000 of the country's 26 million blacks were expected to vote despite a massive government advertising campaign to promote black turnout. About 2.4 million blacks are registered to vote in municipal elections, but blacks have no vote in national elections. In 1983, when black municipal elections were last held, 21 percent of the registered voters cast ballots, and about the same expected this time. Low turnouts also were expected in <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> and `` colored,'' or mixed-race, townships. Asians and mixed-race people have their own houses in the tri-cameral <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, as do the whites. State-of-emergency regulations in effect since 1986 restrict reporting about unrest, security force actions, treatment of detainees, some forms of protest, and a range of statements the government considers subversive. Enforcement of the regulations has not been comprehensive.

 The press credentials of three <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> journalists were suspended on allegations they violated military censorship by failing to submit reports about undercover Israeli army units in the occupied territories. <PERSON> Yoram </PERSON> <PERSON> Ettinger </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Government </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>, said the credentials of <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> and <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Weizman </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Reuters </ORGANIZATION> news agency and <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Whitley </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> were suspended Tuesday pending an investigation. Government and army officials will not grant interviews to the three while their credentials are suspended. `` There is an obvious violation of security regulations without relevance to the authenticity of the information,'' <PERSON> Ettinger </PERSON> told reporters. Censorship officials said police would investigate. Depending on what the police find, they could file charges. Under Israeli law, journalists must submit reports relating to security matters to military censors. The government has not clearly defined `` security matters'' and leaves submission of reports to the discretion of correspondents. A <ORGANIZATION> Reuters </ORGANIZATION> story written by <PERSON> Weizman </PERSON> on Sunday said undercover army units had unusual orders to shoot Palestinians suspected of organizing violent demonstrations. `` We stand by the story,'' said <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>, 34, the <ORGANIZATION> Reuter </ORGANIZATION> bureau chief in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Whitley </PERSON>'s story of Oct. 11 said undercover troops used <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> cars and posed as journalists to detain suspected rioters. <PERSON> Whitley </PERSON>, 39, said he did n't feel he violated censorship because he based his report on previously published material. He also noted he reported on the undercover units in the context of a larger story about stronger steps taken by the army to quell the Palestinian uprising, well into its 11th month. `` I do n't believe I endangered <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s security by exposing dirty tricks in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, but I believe my security is endangered by these people posing as journalists,'' <PERSON> Whitley </PERSON> told The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. The army said Monday: `` Units carry out varied operational activities to preserve security and order, in accordance with the law. There is no unit in the <ORGANIZATION> IDF </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- Israeli <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>, or army -RRB- which is authorized to act, or which acts, against the well-known rules for opening fire which are grounded in the law.'' <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> has worked for <ORGANIZATION> Reuters </ORGANIZATION> for 11 years. <PERSON> Weizman </PERSON>, 34, who has dual Israeli-British citizenship, has worked for <ORGANIZATION> Reuters </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> for 18 months. <PERSON> Whitley </PERSON> has worked for the <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> for 11 years, the last three years in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. Six months ago, the <ORGANIZATION> Government </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> suspended the press credentials of <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fletcher </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> <PERSON> Frankel </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> for not submitting to the censor reports alleging that <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> carried out the assassination of <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> military commander <PERSON> Khalil </PERSON> <PERSON> Wazir </PERSON> in his <LOCATION> Tunis </LOCATION> home April 16. <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> sources confirmed the reports, but the government refused comment. Both reporters later had their credentials restored. The <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> protested the latest suspensions.

 Five men were indicted on federal charges they plotted to import thousands of pounds of cocaine, including a reputed Colombian drug lord who made death threats against Mayor <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Koch </PERSON>, officials say. The indictment Tuesday of <PERSON> Gonzalo </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> <PERSON> Gacha </PERSON> and four others `` reaches into the highest echelon of the multibillion-dollar <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> cartel,'' said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Maloney </PERSON>. According to the indictment by a federal grand jury in <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION>, the five conspired with undercover agents posing as drug brokers to bring 2,200 pounds of cocaine into the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> area every eight days. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Stutman </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>'s office here, said his agency received reports from <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> that <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> <PERSON> Gacha </PERSON> had made death threats against <PERSON> Koch </PERSON>, <PERSON> Stutman </PERSON> and other law enforcement officials. Three Colombians arrested here Thursday had an electronic device that could have been used to set off explosives by remote control, officials said. Informers identified the three as assassins. Because of insufficient evidence, one was released and two were held only on charges of violating immigration law. `` If I am not safe, who is?'' said <PERSON> Koch </PERSON>. `` That is what is horrifying.'' `` The more they threaten, the more we'll go after them,'' said <PERSON> Stutman </PERSON>, who described <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> <PERSON> Gacha </PERSON> as the most active member of the cocaine cartel based in the northern Colombian city of <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION>. It is unlikely <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> <PERSON> Gacha </PERSON> will be prosecuted, federal authorities said, because his <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> homeland does not have an extradition treaty with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Another defendant identified as a lieutenant in the cartel, <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> <PERSON> Vegas </PERSON>, also lives in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>. The other three defendants, identified as employees of the cartel's <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> operation, were arrested July 23 when federal agents seized 1,350 pounds of cocaine near <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Guardia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>, the first shipment in the sting operation. <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> <PERSON> Gacha </PERSON>; <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Jaime </PERSON> <PERSON> Posado </PERSON>, 28, of <LOCATION> Queens </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Jaime </PERSON> <PERSON> Pineda </PERSON>, 29, of <LOCATION> Queens </LOCATION>; and <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Velez </PERSON>, 26, were charged with operating a continuing criminal enterprise, conspiracy to import cocaine and conspiracy to distribute cocaine. If convicted, the defendants could be sentenced to life in prison and fined $ 6 million each. A separate indictment in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> charged <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> <PERSON> Gacha </PERSON> and six others with one count of conspiracy to import cocaine.

<TEXT>
 At least 143 people survived the sinking of a ship during <LOCATION> Typhoon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ruby </LOCATION>, many swimming for hours through raging seas to reach safety on small islands, officials said today. Ships and helicopters searched the area today in hopes of finding hundreds more left missing when the 2,855-ton <PERSON> Dona </PERSON> <PERSON> Marilyn </PERSON> sank Monday with more than 500 people aboard. A shipping executive said survivors struggled onto lifeboats or jumped overboard as the vessel heaved in the storm-whipped <LOCATION> Visayan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION>. It sank about 300 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>. `` Everybody was jumping into the sea,'' said <PERSON> Bernardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Cabigon </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Tacloban </LOCATION> station manager of <ORGANIZATION> Sulpicio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lines </ORGANIZATION>, which owned the <PERSON> Dona </PERSON> <PERSON> Marilyn </PERSON>. `` Others took the lifeboats. But there were so many people that they decided to jump and swim. They looked very tired. They stayed in the water for three hours.'' <PERSON> Cabrigon </PERSON> said 120 of the 143 survivors managed to reach the small, remote island of <PERSON> Almagro </PERSON> with lifejackets and life boats. In <LOCATION> Cebu </LOCATION>, Sulpicio President <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> Go said 13 other survivors were found by rescuers on other islands and in the choppy seas. There were unconfirmed reports scores of others may have reached safety on another island. `` I'm expecting more survivors. We have not called off operations,'' <PERSON> Cabigon </PERSON> said. President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> ordered an investigation into the sinking. She also declared a state of calamity in <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> and 35 provinces hardest hit by Typhoon Ruby, which killed at least 103 people elsewhere in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> Monday and Tuesday. Last December, another Sulpicio ship, the <LOCATION> Dona </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paz </LOCATION>, collided with an oil tanker off <LOCATION> Mindoro </LOCATION> island. Only 28 people survived, and more than 3,000 were believed to have perished in the world's biggest peacetime shipping disaster. <PERSON> Cabrigon </PERSON> said the bodies of 26 victims washed ashore at <PERSON> Almagro </PERSON>. The coast guard said another body was found today in nearby waters. <PERSON> Almagro </PERSON>'s mayor, <PERSON> Raul </PERSON> <PERSON> Escalante </PERSON>, said he had buried 18 of the decomposing victims in a common grave. The Dona <PERSON> Marilyn </PERSON> left <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> on Sunday bound for <LOCATION> Tacloban </LOCATION> but was buffeted Monday by strong waves and winds of up to 140 mph, <PERSON> Cabigon </PERSON> said. The coast guard said the skipper reported the vessel listing in heavy seas in a radioed distress signal before the ship went down. Cabigon quoted survivor <PERSON> Alberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Oledo </PERSON> as saying he jumped from the stricken ship with his wife, son and daughter. The three held hands but were separated in the raging seas, <PERSON> Cabigon </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Oledo </PERSON> managed to reach <PERSON> Maripipi </PERSON> but there was no trace of his wife and children. In a second, smaller rescue effort, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> said the USS Blue Ridge found four crewmen of the 300-foot Philippine freighter Jet Nann Five, which sank about 150 miles south of where the <PERSON> Marilyn </PERSON> is believed to have gone down. A <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> spokesman at the <ORGANIZATION> Subic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Naval </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> said the Blue Ridge was still searching for the vessel's 15 other crewmen. He quoted survivors as saying the Jet Nann Five capsized 12 hours after leaving Cebu Sunday for <LOCATION> Mindanao </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> said the four were being treated for second-degree sunburn, dehydration and mild hypothermia. The <ORGANIZATION> Philippine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> and other relief agencies said 103 people were killed on land in the onslaught of the typhoon, which pummeled the entire archipelago nation with heavy rains and winds Monday and Tuesday. Ruby, now packing 93 mph winds, was reported heading today at 7 mph west-northwest toward <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Philippine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said the typhoon was about 240 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> said 485,000 Filipinos were `` affected'' by <PERSON> Ruby </PERSON>, meaning their homes were destroyed, damaged or flooded or sustained other losses. Among the Ruby's fatalities on land were 26 people who drowned when a bus plunged into a swollen river on <LOCATION> Panay </LOCATION> island, the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> said. The <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> reported 20 people were killed on <LOCATION> Mindoro </LOCATION> island, but gave no details. Most deaths during typhoons in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> are caused by drowning. Other deaths were reported on <LOCATION> Luzon </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Mindanao </LOCATION>, and authorities said they expect the death toll to go up as communications were restored and more reports came in from rural areas.

<TEXT>
 The turnout in the presidential election is expected to be one of the lowest this century, continuing a trend of declining voter participation in a nation that prides itself as a beacon of Western democracy, say political analysts. Public interest groups are warning that only 50 percent or less of the eligible voters will go to the polls on Nov. 8, about the same as the record low 49 percent turnout in the 1924 presidential election. The declining turnout, down from a record high 79 percent in 1896, puts the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> at the bottom of the voter participation list in the world's democratic systems. <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION> heads the average voter participation list with 95 percent while the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> ranks last with 53 percent and <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> second to last at 62 percent, according to figures compiled by <PERSON> Frances </PERSON> <PERSON> Fox </PERSON> <PERSON> Piven </PERSON> and <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Cloward </PERSON> in their book, `` Why Americans Do n't Vote.'' The turnout in the last election, the 1984 contest between President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and Democrat <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mondale </PERSON>, was 53.3 percent of the voting-age population. That was the lowest turnout since the 51.1 percent who gave <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Truman </PERSON> an upset victory over Republican <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Dewey </PERSON> in 1948. Most political scientists attribute the low <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> participation to the requirement that voters register days or weeks before they cast their ballot. In contrast, registration in West European democracies is generally automatic, with the voter receiving a notice in the mail. `` In fact, <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> registration procedures are Byzantine compared with those that prevail in other democracies,'' said <PERSON> Piven </PERSON> and <PERSON> Cloward </PERSON>. <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> <PERSON> Burnham </PERSON>, an expert on voter participation, says that without `` the two-step hurdle'' of registration and voting, turnout would increase 8 to 10 percent. Figures show that 87 percent of those who do register go to the polls on Election Day. Other reasons cited by analysts for low participation include the declining power of the political party system, the generally apolitical nature of the electorate and television, which tends to focus on personalities rather than parties. `` As a result, people do n't feel very represented and it's not very important for them to vote,'' said <PERSON> Burnham </PERSON>, a professor of government at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Austin </LOCATION>. Political parties in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> are far more homogeneous than the Democratic or Republican parties in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, making it easier for voters to take sides and for the parties to target constituents, said <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bingham </PERSON> <PERSON> Powell </PERSON>, chairman of the School of Government at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rochester </ORGANIZATION>. Many Americans do not identify with either of the two major parties, said <PERSON> Powell </PERSON>, who studies the difference between the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and European political systems. Scholars also note that among the non-voters about 75 percent are low-income, less educated Americans who do not feel represented by the existing system and are generally less likely to vote. Others believe the decline in voter participation stems from the general attitude of many Americans. `` Not voting is a reflection of the fact that we're relatively content with life, sated with our lifestyles,'' said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Georgetown </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> scholar. `` People do n't see any reason to vote and change this.'' And many analysts contend that the <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush-Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> race has focused heavily on negative campaigning, further alienating voters. `` If all you see every night is <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> bashing <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> or vice versa, why would you rush out to vote for them? They do n't address issues, what's the point?'' said <PERSON> Curtis </PERSON> <PERSON> Gans </PERSON>, who heads the non-partisan <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> for the Study of the American Electorate. Other political scientists attribute the drop of voters to the multi-level system of local elections, gubernatorial and state legislature elections, congressional elections and the presidential election. `` People are baffled by the system, they do n't feel their vote can make any difference to their children's school or the state of the local roads,'' <PERSON> Gans </PERSON> said. Turnout for local and congressional elections is about 20 to 30 percent lower than for presidential elections. `` There's an incredible degree of apoliticality in this country, compared to <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Burnham </PERSON>. `` In fact, people regard the campaign as just another horse race. It comes along with the baseball season and football seasons. People participate vicariously at home, but do n't feel they need to go out and join in.''

 Lebanese newspapers today published a letter from a committee of journalists marking the 41st birthday of American hostage <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>. <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, chief <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> correspondent for <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, is the longest-held of the 14 foreign hostages held in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. He was kidnapped March 16, 1985. The journalist, held by a pro-Iranian Shiite Moslem faction calling itself Islamic Jihad, or Holy War, turns 41 on Thursday. `` Your colleagues in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and throughout the world salute you today on your birthday,'' said the letter published by seven of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s 11 Arabic-language daily newspapers. Although the letter was sent to the newspapers in English, they only published a translation of it in Arabic. <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> is not known to read Arabic. The newspapers also published a photograph of American country music star <PERSON> Hank </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> receiving a bracelet from <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>'s sister, <PERSON> Peggy </PERSON> <PERSON> Say </PERSON> The bracelet carries <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>'s name and the date of his abduction. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> signed a birthday card for <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, as did other stars before the Country Music Association Awards show began in <LOCATION> Nashville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION> on Oct. 10. The papers that published the letter included <PERSON> Al-Haqiqa </PERSON>, the mainstream <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Amal </ORGANIZATION> militia's main daily publication. Amal is locked in a power struggle with the pro-Iranian fundamentalists who include <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>'s kidnappers. <ORGANIZATION> Amal </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Nabih </PERSON> <PERSON> Berri </PERSON>, who also is justice minister in the predominantly <ORGANIZATION> Moslem </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s dual government, has denounced the kidnapping of foreigners as an `` unforgivable crime.'' The letter to <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> said: `` Those of us on the <ORGANIZATION> Journalists </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> to Free <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, as well as thousands of others throughout our profession, pay tribute to you for honoring throughout your career the highest standards of journalism. `` We respect your commitment to truth and fairness in your coverage of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, your partisanship towards none, your respect towards all,'' the letter added. `` Yet we also honor you today as a man of dignity and courage in the dark places of privation. All free men and women who live by the pen share this morning in your captivity,'' it said. `` As you mark your 41st birthday, your fourth in incarceration, we join our hearts with yours in yearning for your freedom. We greet you, we salute you and we encourage you,'' the letter said. In addition to <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, the 13 foreigners missing in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> are eight Americans, three Britons, an Italian and an Irishman.

 Chanting anti-government and anti-U.S. slogans, radical students today threw firebombs and rocks at three government buildings and a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> cultural center, police and news reports said. About 100 students directed their attack on the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> building in the southern city of <LOCATION> Taegu </LOCATION>, police and the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> said. It was the third attack on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> offices in two weeks. The embassy said in a statement that the assailants threw stones and firebombs, which did not explode, and dispersed police guarding the center. The students fled when police reinforcements arrived and fired tear gas, it said. There were no injuries, but windows at the center were broken, and a <ORGANIZATION> USIS </ORGANIZATION> car and two other cars in the parking lot were damaged, the embassy said. <PERSON> Yonhap </PERSON>, the South Korean news agency, said assailants also firebombed a police building near the center, shattering 10 windows. The agency said bands of students carrying firebombs and clubs also attacked a government party building and a government prosecutors' office in downtown <LOCATION> Taegu </LOCATION>, smashing windows and destroying two cars. Police said 13 students were arrested. One student was hospitalized after he cut his wrist with a knife and jumped off a fourth-floor office to a safety net on the ground when police charged into the prosecutors' building, which had been seized by 10 students, police said. <PERSON> Yonhap </PERSON> said students were demanding the arrest of former President <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> <PERSON> Doo-hwan </PERSON>, who is under parliamentary investigation for alleged corruption. Also today, two cars were burned in southern <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> when 250 students hurled firebombs in a brief street protest demanding <PERSON> Chun </PERSON>'s arrest The radicals also demand the withdrawal of about 42,000 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops stationed in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> under a mutual defense pact, contending the presence of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops hampers unification of the <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> <LOCATION> peninsula </LOCATION>, which has been divided since 1945. Police have tightened security around the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION>, cultural centers and other American government facilities because of the current anti-U.S. campaign, which has been on the rise since the Olympic Games ended Oct. 2. On Oct. 14, students injured 13 policemen and razed a police bus in a firebomb attack on a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> cultural center in the southern city of <LOCATION> Kwangju </LOCATION>. About 21 students hurled firebombs at a U.S.O. building near downtown <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> on Friday, a week after a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> soldier and three Koreans were injured in a group fight involving dozens of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> soldiers and <LOCATION> Koreans </LOCATION> near <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military headquarters in southern <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>.

 Two sisters who work in the same factory will share a $ 31.5 million lottery jackpot, despite the fact that neither one selected the six winning numbers. <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Ellen </PERSON> <PERSON> Snipes </PERSON> and <PERSON> Maxine </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said the winning numbers were selected by <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Snipes </PERSON>' ex-husband, <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> <PERSON> Snipes </PERSON>, who chose the numbers from the stub of her last paycheck. He also bought the 10 tickets on behalf of the sisters. <PERSON> Snipes </PERSON>, who was at a news conference with the sisters Tuesday, was asked if he would get any of the money. `` That's still in question,'' he said. He and his ex-wife were asked if they were going to get married again. `` No way,'' she replied. But she did say she remained close to <PERSON> Snipes </PERSON>, thanked him for his role in her winning _ and said he would get some of the money. The women, both assembly line leaders at a <LOCATION> Riviera </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> electronic components company called <ORGANIZATION> Solitron </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Devices </ORGANIZATION>, will share $ 1,576,743 a year, before taxes, for the next 20 years. The total prize is the third-largest since the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> lottery began early this year. `` We always go in together,'' Miss <PERSON> Snipes </PERSON> said. The sisters, who live in the southeastern <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> farming community of <LOCATION> Indiantown </LOCATION>, took the day off from work to file their claim. Miss <PERSON> Snipes </PERSON> said she plans to keep working and would build a `` dream house'' with her new wealth. Mrs. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said she did n't know what she would do with her half of the money and was unsure whether she would keep her job. But she said she would keep working at least until Nov. 2, when the first lottery check is expected to arrive. Both women declined to give their ages, but said they were grandmothers. The winning numbers were 3, 11, 14, 15, 27 and 40.

<HEAD>Sources: Poland Would Like Diplomatic Recognition From Vatican</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By VICTOR L. SIMPSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>VATICAN CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The Polish government is willing to make concessions to the <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> in hopes of obtaining full diplomatic recognition from the Holy See, <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> sources said today. At recent talks at the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION>, the Polish government presented a revised version of a longstanding proposal that would offer the church greater freedoms and rights, said the sources. They spoke on condition of anonymity. They said no decisions were made and further negotiations are not expected before January. The sources, familar with the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION>'s Eastern European policy, said the Polish government for some time has been seeking to re-establish formal relations, which were broken when the Communists took power after World War II. The government proposal is believed to include legal guarantees for the church; agreement to allow lay <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> groups; and promises to end restrictions on the <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> press, such as in the supply of newsprint. One source said the proposals were n't contingent on the granting of full recognition but that it is known the government would welcome the gesture from the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION>. It is believed that such a move by the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> would bolster Polish leaders in their attempt to deal with internal dissent. However, some <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> officials are skeptical about such a move at this time. And Polish-born Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> has stressed the need to make such relations `` credible'' in the eyes of the Polish people and the world. <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> bishops have long sought a statute for the church to protect it from the whims of various leaders. The church has traditionally played an important role in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and supported the Solidarity labor movement, which was outlawed after the government declared martial law in December 1981. Church representatives have been invited to attend talks with the government and political opposition. Those talks were agreed to in August by the government in return for labor leaders ending strikes across the country. The start of the talks have been snagged by government objections to two delegates proposed by Solidarity.

<TEXT>
 An Aeroperu jetliner carrying 69 people crashed on an Andean plain in southwestern <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>, killing 12 people. Officials said more people would have died if the pilot had not swerved to avoid a hill. The state-owned airline said an <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> and three Europeans were among those killed Tuesday when the twin-jet Fokker-28, filled to capacity with 65 passengers and a crew of four, slammed into a flood plain a minute after takeoff. Aeroperu spokesman <PERSON> Freddy </PERSON> <PERSON> Chirinos </PERSON> said 44 people were injured. One person was unaccounted for, he said. Many victims died from burns suffered after the plane split in three pieces on impact and the tail section burst into flames, officials said. Wreckage was scattered across a half acre of pasture and a riverbed. The jet had taken off from the <ORGANIZATION> Manco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Capac </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airport </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Juliaca </LOCATION>, which is more than 12,000 feet above sea level near <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Titicaca </LOCATION> in southern <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Chirinos </PERSON> said at least 19 foreigners, mainly tourists returning from the lake, were aboard the craft. Flight 771 was en route to <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION>, 540 miles northwest, with a stop in <LOCATION> Arequipa </LOCATION>. Aeroperu identified the foreign dead as <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Kurt </PERSON> <PERSON> Lenz </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Ervert </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ingeborg </PERSON> <PERSON> Psiller </PERSON> of <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>. It gave no hometowns for the victims. Survivors and witnesses on the ground said the aircraft lost altitude seconds into the flight but regained it before crashing alongside the <LOCATION> Cabanillas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, one mile northwest of the airport. Transportation Minister <PERSON> Camilo </PERSON> <PERSON> Carrillo </PERSON> told reporters in <LOCATION> Juliaca </LOCATION> that pilot <PERSON> Fernando </PERSON> <PERSON> Bellina </PERSON>, who survived, averted greater disaster by swerving the stricken craft to avoid a hill and crash landing on flood plain sand, which absorbed some of the impact. Congressman <PERSON> Rolando </PERSON> <PERSON> Avila </PERSON>, another survivor, said the aircraft had flown only about 400 yards after takeoff when an explosion shook it and the jets cut off. `` The pilots apparently tried to level off to land and the plane scraped the roofs of some adobe homes before falling,'' he said. Airline officials would not speculate on what caused the crash. They said an investigation was under way. <PERSON> Cesar </PERSON> <PERSON> Atala </PERSON>, a director of the Pilot's <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeroperu </ORGANIZATION>, said the union might call a strike today to protest airline maintenance practices. He reiterated the association's charge that Aeroperu's fleet of 10 jetliners is in poor shape due to a shortage of spare parts. But <PERSON> Johnny </PERSON> <PERSON> Cabrere </PERSON>, an Aeroperu air cargo employee in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, said flights were operating today. `` We're operating normally,'' he said. <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>, suffering through a severe economic crisis, is virtually out of dollar reserves to import spare parts for much of its industry. The last major air accident in <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION> occurred Dec. 9 when a twin-engine <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fokker </ORGANIZATION> F-27 crashed off <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> coast, killing 44 people, including nearly the entire squad of <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>'s leading soccer team, <LOCATION> Alianza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION> <PERSON> Chirinos </PERSON> identified the injured foreigners as <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Dunning </PERSON>, <PERSON> Catherine </PERSON> <PERSON> Kanskey </PERSON>, <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Savoir </PERSON>, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Reilly </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahoney </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Kranki </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Luana </PERSON> and <PERSON> Rafael </PERSON> <PERSON> Gianinazzi </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Koyson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Brigitte </PERSON> <PERSON> Kahson </PERSON> of <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Kabin </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Joacy </PERSON> <PERSON> Borge </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>; and <PERSON> Esther </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ana </PERSON> <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gina </PERSON> <PERSON> Garfias </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Philippines Denies Soviet Access To Shipyard Near U.S. Base</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The government refused Soviet access to a shipyard next to <ORGANIZATION> Subic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bay </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Naval </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> because of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> fears the Soviets would spy on the American facility, an official said today. `` Our policy is not to allow -LRB- the Soviets -RRB-'' access to the <ORGANIZATION> Philippine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shipyard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineering </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, the government's news agency quoted <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Yan </PERSON>, undersecretary of foreign affairs, as saying. `` They are allowed to repair ships in other shipyards but not there,'' <PERSON> Yan </PERSON> added. He noted that the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> had rejected previous Soviet requests to use the shipyard, which is on <LOCATION> Subic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>, next to the American facility. <PERSON> Yan </PERSON> did not say when the Soviets last made such a request. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> said last week the Soviets had asked to use the shipyard. The officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said they were worried <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> might grant the request because the shipyard is losing money and because of dissatisfaction over recent negotiations on the lease covering <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military bases in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>. Last week, the two countries signed an agreement under which the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will pay $ 962 million in military and economic aid for use of the bases in 1991 and 1992. Philippine officials wanted up to $ 2.3 billion a year for use of the six bases.

<HEAD>Atlantic Salmon Reintroduced to Connecticut River</HEAD>

 <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> salmon are swimming in the <LOCATION> Shetucket </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> for the first time in about 150 years. <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> workers on Tuesday released some 200 salmon as part of a program aimed at reintroducing the once-native fish into the <LOCATION> Thames </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> and its tributaries. <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> salmon were once plentiful in the rivers of southeastern <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>. Power-generation dams along the rivers, first installed in the mid-1800s, prevented the salmon from swimming to their spawning grounds. The effort to reintroduce the fish, if successful, would be not only a victory for conservationists, but also a boon for the local economy as fishermen journey to the region for the chance to catch the prized fish. When <LOCATION> Oswego </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> reintroduced salmon into its rivers early this decade, tourists pumped an additional $ 7 million to $ 8 million into the economy annually, according to studies. <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Whiteley </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Thames </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> River </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Watershed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, said some of the salmon probably will begin migrating down the <LOCATION> Thames </LOCATION> on a 6,000-mile trip to the waters of <LOCATION> Greenland </LOCATION> and back. The earliest the fish would return would be 1990. By then, <PERSON> Whiteley </PERSON> said, it is hoped a fish ladder at Greeneville Dam will be completed to allow the fish to continue upstream to natural spawning grounds in shallow waters. However, the restocking effort will not succeed until fish ladders are installed at two dams farther north. It could take decades for the river to become a natural habitat again for the salmon, <PERSON> Whiteley </PERSON> said. But Tuesday was a start. The fish were trucked to the banks of the river, then unloaded by net into large plastic barrels. Workers carried the barrels to the water's edge and dumped the fish into the river. The salmon are identified with yellow tags attached to a fin. The fish, about two to three pounds apiece, were raised in the <LOCATION> Kensington </LOCATION> <LOCATION> State </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salmon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hatchery </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>.

 Palestinians misread a date on smudged underground leaflets and went on strike by mistake today in parts of the occupied territories and <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>. Seven Arab youths were reported shot and wounded, meanwhile, in clashes between stone-throwers and <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> troops today in the occupied territories. Strikers closed most businesses and schools and paralyzed transportation in much of the occupied <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. Most Gazan Arabs who work in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> stayed home, according to <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> reports. Some stores in Arab east <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> and parts of <LOCATION> Hebron </LOCATION>, a city in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, also were closed, but transportation was operating normally in both places. In parts of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, young people who normally enforce strikes visited merchants on Tuesday to explain that the strike was supposed to be on Saturday, Oct. 29, not today, Oct. 26. The figures for nine and six look similar in Arabic writing, and smudged printing on some of the leaflets caused the confusion. The leaflets were issued by the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Leadership </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Uprising </ORGANIZATION>, which regularly orders strikes as a tactic in the revolt against Israeli rule of the territories captured in the 1967 <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> war. At least 303 Palestinians and six Israelis have been killed during the uprising, which began Dec. 8. More than 7,000 Palestinians have been wounded, according to the Israeli government. In <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>'s largest city, three <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> teen-agers were shot today in three separate stone-throwing confrontations, hospital officials said. A 20-year-old man also was admitted to a hospital after he was shot during a clash in the <LOCATION> Tulkarem </LOCATION> refugee camp, the officials said. In the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, two 15-year-old boys were shot with plastic bullets in separate clashes with soldiers in the <LOCATION> Sabra </LOCATION> neighborhood of <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> and in the Jabaliya refugee camp, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> reporters and hospital officials said. Israeli troops have begun using the plastic bullets because they are less apt to kill. An 18-year-old man was wounded in the leg with a plastic bullet when troops opened fire in <LOCATION> Rafah </LOCATION>, hospital officials said. The Israeli army said it could not confirm the reports of shootings. Also today, the army imposed curfews on seven <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> refugee camps and a neighborhood of <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. Troops wrecked five Palestinian houses in the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> towns of <PERSON> Khan </PERSON> <PERSON> Yunis </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Rafah </LOCATION> as part of their effort to put down the revolt.

 The Cabinet of one of the country's six republics resigned during a debate over its crackdown on an anti-government protest, news media reported today The resignation in the southern republic of <LOCATION> Montenegro </LOCATION> came Tuesday after the republic's <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> opened debate on whether its government and presidency overstepped authority in using police to put down the demonstation earlier this month, the reports said. The Montenegrin government said it was stepping down after five of its 20 members, including <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> Minister <PERSON> Lazar </PERSON> <PERSON> Djodjic </PERSON>, lost a vote of confidence during the parliamentary session, the <LOCATION> Belgrade </LOCATION> daily newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Politika </ORGANIZATION> said today. The government decided to submit its collective resignation because it `` could not operate in the complex situation'' in which five ministers lost the vote, <ORGANIZATION> Politika </ORGANIZATION> quoted Premier <PERSON> Vuko </PERSON> <PERSON> Vukadinovic </PERSON> as saying. The nine-man presidency, however, won a vote of confidence Tuesday. The <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, after its 12-hour session late Tuesday, postponed consideration of whether to accept the government's resignation and reconvened today, <LOCATION> Belgrade </LOCATION> news media reported. At least 10 people were injured and 12 arrested earlier this month in <LOCATION> Titograd </LOCATION>, the capital of <LOCATION> Montenegro </LOCATION>, when police used tear gas to disperse demonstrators protesting falling living standards. <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> is suffering its worst economic crisis with 217 percent annual inflation, 15 percent unemployment and steadily declining living standards. The Titograd demonstrators were also demanding an end to what they view as persecution of the minority Slav population by ethnic Albanians in the neighboring province of <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION>. The economic and ethnic issues have combined to give rise to unrest and calls for an overhaul of <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leadership across <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> in recent months. Leaders in <LOCATION> Vojvodina </LOCATION>, the nation's other province, were forced out earlier this month. Both <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Vojvodina </LOCATION>, though nominally autonomous, are partly controlled by the republic of <LOCATION> Serbia </LOCATION>. The decentralized system of government and a collective federal presidency were devised in the late President <PERSON> Josip </PERSON> <PERSON> Broz </PERSON> <PERSON> Tito </PERSON>'s 1974 constitution to prevent one republic from gaining sway over the others, but it has resulted in an ineffective government by compromise.

 A magistrate today delayed the hearing of the captain of an Italian freighter accused of manslaughter in the collision of his vessel with a Greek cruise ship carrying 486 British tourists. The hearing before an investigating magistrate was set for next Tuesday. Capt. <PERSON> Flavio </PERSON> <PERSON> Caminale </PERSON>, 45, of <LOCATION> Genoa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, made the request during a hearing at a <LOCATION> Piraeus </LOCATION> court, citing problems with translating statements by witnesses from Greek into Italian. `` I'm innocent, but we must have more time to prepare everything that's needed,'' <PERSON> Caminale </PERSON> said. `` It's a question of translation.'' Investigating Magistrate <PERSON> Telemachus </PERSON> <PERSON> Flesouras </PERSON> granted the request, but ruled Caminale must remain in detention. Two Greek sailors died, and a 14-year-old British girl and a teacher are missing after Friday's collision between the 6,300-ton cruise ship Jupiter and and the 5,500-ton freighter Adige outside <LOCATION> Piraeus </LOCATION> harbor. <PERSON> Caminale </PERSON> was arrested after the collision. He faces charges of manslaughter through negligence, causing serious injuries, causing a shipwreck and ignoring shipping regulations. If convicted, he could be jailed up to five years. <PERSON> Caminale </PERSON> maintains his ship was at a standstill when the Jupiter headed directly for his ship. He said the Jupiter swung around to avoid a collision but struck the Adige. Greek officials say the Adige was approaching the Jupiter and was unable to reverse in time. The Adige, which suffered minor damage, was impounded during an official inquiry.

 Homicide detectives are investigating the deaths of three people who died after injecting possibly contaminated cocaine that they had all bought in the same place, authorities said. In addition, officials are trying to determine whether the death of a fourth man, and the illness of a fifth, are linked to the others. `` All five knew each other and two of them said they all bought cocaine at the same place -LRB- on the <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> waterfront -RRB-,'' said <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Whidmeyer </PERSON>, spokesman for <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Taub </PERSON> <PERSON> Hospital </PERSON>. He said `` a very educated guess'' is that the cocaine was heavily laced with boric acid, adding, `` There's some coke out there that's playing Russian roulette. Cocaine sometimes is cut with other substances so dealers can sell more of the illegal drug. Boric acid is a white cystalline compound and is used as a mild antiseptic, to manufacture cements and enamels, and to kill roaches. Experts say it also can cause cardiovascular shock. Those who died apparently had injected the drug, and two of them told doctors they thought they had gotten `` some bad cocaine,'' <PERSON> Whidmeyer </PERSON> said. They complained of tremendous dehydration, heart palpitations and nausea. `` They were scared,'' he said. Two of those taken to <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Taub </PERSON> died Monday and the third died during the night _ all unofficially from cardiac arrest and renal failure, <PERSON> Whidmeyer </PERSON> said. The fourth person died Monday at another hospital.

<TEXT>
 About 400 chanting protesters forced producers to stop filming an episode of a television show that features the revenge killing of a bisexual man who spreads the AIDS virus. The protesters Tuesday night appeared to disobey a temporary restraining order obtained by the producers of `` Midnight Caller'' that ordered them to stay at least 100 feet from filming and to remain silent. Instead, protesters shouted slogans such as `` Act up, fight back, fight AIDS,'' and engaged in an hourlong faceoff with about 50 police officers until filming was called off at 8 p.m. AIDS Foundation spokesman <PERSON> Rene </PERSON> <PERSON> Durazzo </PERSON> said protesters do not object to an episode about the AIDS epidemic, but `` want an accurate portrayal of the AIDS crisis'' not an episode they fear will `` promote irrational fear and ignorance.'' Protesters say the show could incite violence against AIDS victims. The show, which has been filming here for several weeks, features a detective who becomes a radio talk show host. The controversial episode concerns a man with AIDS who continues to have unsafe sex until a former lover kills him. The producers said they already have made plot changes to show they do not condone the murder. At first, the hero helped the lover escape. But in the revised version, she is arrested. Protesters want the murder deleted from the plot.

In Stone Mountain, <LOCATION> Ga. </LOCATION>, on Monday, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is actively encouraging his campaign surrogates to dish out `` political sludge'' against the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> ticket. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> also was campaigning in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Little </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Havana </LOCATION> Cuban community and <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lauderdale </LOCATION> before heading to <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, and later in the week to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>. In response to a new <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News-New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> poll that showed <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> with a 13-point lead over <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said, `` The race is not over. It's a good sign. It's a positive development. Who knows what will happen in these last two weeks.'' The vice presidential candidate also said: `` We are confident we are going to win, but we're not overconfident.'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> was answering abortion questions again on Tuesday in his plane to <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> senator was asked about a comment the previous day in which he said that he hoped if his wife were raped and became pregnant, she would elect to have the baby and not have the abortion. Asked if that was n't a pro-choice stance, he said: `` It's her choice, I told her what I would like but it's her choice. I ca n't tell my wife what to do in that situation. `` She would have that choice'' under the law as it is now written, he said. He added that he does not, however, support that law and favors allowing each state to determine its own guidelines on abortion. In another interview, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> told a persistent young reporter from a children's news program he would rather she had a baby than abort the fetus if she became pregnant through her father. `` That's a difficult question and one that does not have an easy answer, but my answer would be yes,'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> told an 11-year-old reporter for `` Chidren's Express'' during a bus tour of <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> last week. The question-and-answer session was broadcast Tuesday on the CBS Evening News. The children's show is broadcast on public television.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> news agency said today the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> space shuttle will blast off on its maiden flight Saturday morning, making an unmanned trip into space designed to break the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> monopoly on reusable spacecraft. `` The Energia system is to blast off at 6:23 -LRB- a.m. -RRB- <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> time on Oct. 29,'' <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said in its brief dispatch. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said final checks were being made on systems aboard the orbiter, named the `` Buran'' -LRB- Snowstorm -RRB-, and the <ORGANIZATION> Energia </ORGANIZATION> booster rocket that will carry it into orbit. The shuttle is also being prepared for fueling, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. The delta-winged Soviet shuttle, which looks like its older <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> cousin, has been in the development stages for years, and space officials here had long promised a launch this year. But they also acknowledged that technical difficulties caused delays. The Soviets also have cited the Jan. 28, 1986, explosion of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> shuttle Challenger as a reason for caution. Seven astronauts died when the Challenger blew up. In previous reports, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> has said the Soviet shuttle will be launched from the Baikonur Cosmodrome on the Central Asian steppes in <LOCATION> Kazakhstan </LOCATION>.

 Here are excerpts from recent editorials in newspapers throughout the nation. Oct. 23 The Wenatchee -LRB- <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION> -RRB- World on child care: A heretofore groggy corporate <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> is finally waking up to the depth and breadth of the child care issue. That's because valuable employees -LRB- many of them women -RRB- are increasingly weighing child care options as they decide where to work. ... The issue is getting its first serious governmental attention as the reality sinks in that more and more households are inevitably going to be two-worker situations. Recognition of that fact at the private corporate level is no doubt helping to spur government interest. Just one thing: While all these efforts to create better situations for children -LRB- and parents -RRB- are laudable, we need to keep in mind that families who decide to have one parent stay home to raise the kids themselves -LRB- and thereby sacrifice that second income -RRB- ought not to be penalized in any way by tax write-offs or tax increases which are not equitably applied.

 Oct 21 The Oak Ridger, <LOCATION> Oak </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ridge </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>, on the Department of Veterans Affairs: <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> campaigned in 1980 on a theme of getting big government off the backs of the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people. Part of that campaign included proposals to abolish the two newest Cabinet departments, Energy and Education. Those plans have long since been dropped and the departments are flourishing bureaucracies. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> recently gave final approval of a new Department of Veterans Affairs, in effect elevating the Veterans Administration to Cabinet status. Each time a <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> department is added it means new, and often duplicated, expense. And with the new status, the departments begin to grow far beyond their previous bounds. Of course, in an election year it's not likely that anybody would oppose creation of a Department of Veterans Affairs. That might smack of being anti-veteran. What we are likely to see is a new tangle of rules and regulations as the bureaucrats carve out their niches in the new department. And veterans, like non-veterans, will help foot the bill through taxes.

But the technology is available and it's only a matter of time. Given that prospect, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> acted prudently last week in approving a ban on firearms capable of evading detection by metal detectors or X-ray machines. The measure is a necessity. It bans the manufacture, importation, sale, shipment or possession of any firearm containing less than 3.7 ounces of stainless steel, exclusive of parts and magazines. Without this sort of legislation it would be possible for terrorists and other criminals to smuggle concealed weapons through detection devices at airports or courtrooms. With it, the job of law enforcement officials is enhanced. ... The measure is a sensible one. Far better to confront the problem now, before undetectable plastic firearms are on the market and on the street.

 <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> warplanes today attacked <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> guerrilla bases in southern and central <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. Police said at least six people were killed and 40 injured near <LOCATION> Sidon </LOCATION>. Nine more people were missing and feared dead in the rubble of at least 30 buildings destroyed near the southern port city of <LOCATION> Sidon </LOCATION>, police said. The Israeli air raids were the third and fourth on <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> since a suicide car bomber killed eight <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers a week ago. Also today, <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> gunners and allied militiamen fired mortars and howitzers at leftist Lebanese factions allied with the Palestinians in and around the southeastern town of <LOCATION> Mashgara </LOCATION>, police said. A <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> troops were preparing for a major ground assault in southern <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. Those killed near <LOCATION> Sidon </LOCATION> included Col. <PERSON> Mustafa </PERSON> <PERSON> Daoud </PERSON>, commander of a 1,000-man militia attached to the <ORGANIZATION> Fatah </ORGANIZATION> guerrilla faction of the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>. The wounded included Col. <PERSON> Mohsen </PERSON> <PERSON> Hallak </PERSON>, commander of the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>'s 1,000-strong Beit al-Maqdes batallion and officers of Force 17, the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>'s security apparatus, police said. Reporters saw 20 people lying on the ground, apparently dead or wounded. Four fighter-bombers thundered in from the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> sky west of <LOCATION> Sidon </LOCATION> at 11 a.m., a police officer said, to stage `` one of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s heaviest air assaults, if not the heaviest, this year.'' They fired 12 rockets into the refugee camp of <LOCATION> Mieh </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mieh </LOCATION> and the nearby <PERSON> Ein </PERSON> el-Dilb hill on <LOCATION> Sidon </LOCATION>'s southeastern outskirts in three sorties spaced over eight minutes, police reported. At 2:30 p.m., <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> warplanes attacked pro-Syrian Palestinian guerrilla bases just south of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> in suburban <LOCATION> Khalde </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Aramoun </LOCATION> and in hills above the coastal towns of <LOCATION> Damour </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Naameh </LOCATION>, police said. <LOCATION> Damour </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Naameh </LOCATION> are located midway on the coastal highway between <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Sidon </LOCATION>. Casualty reports from those attacks were not immediately available. Syrian anti-craft batteries near <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> airport and <PERSON> Aramoun </PERSON> opened up at the Israeli planes, but no hits were claimed, police said. Describing the damage near <LOCATION> Sidon </LOCATION>, a police spokesman said, `` At least 30 buildings within a radius of 150 yards in <LOCATION> Mieh </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mieh </LOCATION>'s central square were pulverized Many victims, `` including a family of six members, are still buried in the rubble,'' said the spokesman, who demanded anonymity. `` It's a massacre,'' said <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organiztaion </ORGANIZATION> military commander of the <LOCATION> Sidon </LOCATION> region who uses only his nom-de-guerre. `` Plenty of people are buried in the debris.'' `` It was so swift that we could n't look up at the sky to fire back at the planes,'' said a guerrilla who identified himself only as <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Khaled </PERSON>. `` We were stunned, motionless. No one even dared to go to the rescue until a half-hour after the raid ended,'' he said. Targets belonging to <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> chairman <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s mainstream <ORGANIZATION> Fatah </ORGANIZATION> guerrilla group in <LOCATION> Mieh </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mieh </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Ein </PERSON> <PERSON> el-Dilb </PERSON> took the brunt of the attack. Most of them were one-story houses, police said. Two command posts of the Marxist Popular Front for the <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> and the Moscow-oriented <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> for the <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> also were flattened, police said. Israeli said the targets had been used as bases for launching attacks against <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, the military command confirmed the raids on the <LOCATION> Sidon </LOCATION> area, the hills above <LOCATION> Damour </LOCATION> and the bluffs just above <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, saying the jets scored accurate hits and returned safely to base. Israeli gunners and allied militiamen of the <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lebanon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> today fired mortars and howitzers at leftist Lebanese factions allied with the Palestinians in and around the southeastern town of <LOCATION> Mashgara </LOCATION>, police said.

<TEXT>
 Democrat <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> promises families and workers he's `` on your side'' in four new television ads playing to his party's strengths, while Republican <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> alleges in another spot that his rival misled 62 million Americans. The new <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> ads were scheduled to begin airing Thursday in spot markets around the country, said spokeswoman <PERSON> Lorraine </PERSON> <PERSON> Voles </PERSON>. The new <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> ad began airing Wednesday night, also in spot markets. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> spot, the latest development in a series of tit-for-tat distortion charges, says the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor `` deliberately misled'' 62 million Americans when he denied during the televised Oct. 13 presidential debate that he raided his state pension system to balance the budget. Quoting The <ORGANIZATION> Wall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Street </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION> as saying `` it is indisputable'' that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> shifted the money, a narrator concludes: `` And <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> says <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is running a campaign of lies? <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is unbelievable.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> each are running a mix of positive and attack ads, concentrated most heavily in pivotal states like <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>. One of the new <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> ads shows an elderly couple on a bench in an urban park. A voiceover says: `` Imagine a place where people can grow old without being made to feel like a burden. Is that too much to expect? As president, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> would be on your side. To those who would cut <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION>, he'll say never. And he'll back full cost-of-living adjustments.'' Another shows children on a playground and says: `` Imagine a place where children come out to play without fear of drugs or drug dealers. Is that too much to expect? As president, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> will be on your side. He'll declare a real war on drugs. Double the number of drug agents and slash aid to countries that allow drug traffic.'' The other two spots talk about stretching two paychecks `` for the life one paycheck used to bring'' and vow to `` take on the toughest foreign competition and make <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> number one again.'' All four ads end with the tagline: `` Dukakis-Bentsen. The best <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> is yet to come.'' The <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign announced two more network appearances for its candidate _ an interview with <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Rather </PERSON> on the <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Evening </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday night, 14 minutes long according to <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> producers; and an interview Friday with <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> anchor <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Brokaw </PERSON> for a series next week on the candidate's positions. Democratic vice presidential nominee <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> was scheduled to appear Wednesday night on CBS News. The <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign also has purchased five minutes of television time for <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> on the CBS network Sunday night, said campaign adviser <PERSON> Tad </PERSON> <PERSON> Devine </PERSON>. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> will be interviewed by <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Frost </PERSON> for a <ORGANIZATION> Fox </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> network show to be broadcast Nov. 6, two days before the election. Since adopting a high-profile media strategy aimed at getting voters to take another look at his candidacy, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has appeared on the three network morning programs, a nationally televised cable interview show and <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Nightline.'' He also bought four five-minute, prime-time slots for a paid advertisement that aired Saturday night on <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>. It was repeated Tuesday night and will be shown again Nov. 1 and Nov. 5. Each airing costs the campaign between $ 125,000 and $ 175,000. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had a stormy 9-minute confrontation with Rather on <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> last Jan. 25, during the height of the primary season. He turned down the `` Nightline'' invitation, saying he had already appeared on the show, but is weighing interview requests from other news and talk shows. `` We're giving serious consideration to a few of them,'' said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Goodin </PERSON>. `` We will end up doing several. How many I do n't know. It's a question of whether we can get to them.''

 A judge has upheld the re-election of the <LOCATION> Selma </LOCATION> mayor to a record seventh term, ruling that a black former city councilman failed to provide any evidence the results were tainted. <ORGANIZATION> Montgomery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Joseph </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Phelps </ORGANIZATION> also ordered challenger <PERSON> Cleophus </PERSON> <PERSON> Mann </PERSON> to pay all court costs. <PERSON> Phelps </PERSON> heard the case in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, where <LOCATION> Selma </LOCATION> is located, after two <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> judges removed themselves from the case. <PERSON> Mann </PERSON> failed by 433 votes to force a runoff from the Aug. 23 election with incumbent Mayor <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Smitherman </PERSON>. <PERSON> Mann </PERSON> challenged the results, saying polling places had been moved improperly and voters were intimidated, but <PERSON> Phelps </PERSON> ruled Tuesday that the suit had no basis. `` The plaintiff -LRB- <PERSON> Mann </PERSON> -RRB- testified he had no evidence that illegal votes had been cast in the Aug. 23 election and did not offer any evidence regarding the casting of illegal votes at trial,'' said <PERSON> Phelps </PERSON>. `` I do n't want to beat a dead dog, but there never was a case to start with,'' <PERSON> Smitherman </PERSON> said. `` He had his day in court, and the judge's order speaks for itself.'' <PERSON> Mann </PERSON> refused to comment on the decision. <PERSON> Phelps </PERSON> said <PERSON> Mann </PERSON>'s claim seemed to focus on allegations that the city failed to obtain approval from the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> before moving several polling places, as required under the 1965 Voting Rights Act. But the judge noted that <PERSON> Mann </PERSON> voted for the changes when he served on the city council and said that the moves were for the convenience of voters, not for discriminatory purposes. During an Oct. 17 hearing, <PERSON> Mann </PERSON> testified that voters were intimidated and pointed to the presence of <LOCATION> Selma </LOCATION> Police Chief M.E. <LOCATION> Summerlin </LOCATION> at the polls wearing his weapon. But in his ruling, <PERSON> Phelps </PERSON> said he found `` no act of intimidation or other acts of misconduct'' calculated to prevent the exercise of the right to vote. <PERSON> Smitherman </PERSON> was elected to his first term as mayor of the western <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> city shortly before it drew national attention as a battleground of the civil rights movement.

<HEAD>Rocky Flats Workers Get Report On Building 771</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Note language in 4th graf</NOTE>
<DATELINE>GOLDEN, Colo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Plutonium particles floating in the air inside a key nuclear weapons facility contaminated two employees and a <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> inspector on Sept. 29, a federal official said. <PERSON> Earl </PERSON> <PERSON> Whiteman </PERSON>, who supervises a 60-person <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> office at Rocky Flats, gave the report Tuesday night before 300 workers, plant critics and others, as he explained the incidents of the past few weeks. But most of the audience said they left dissatisfied with <PERSON> Whiteman </PERSON>'s answers about contamination. `` We may sometimes not be good at explaining everything,'' <PERSON> Whiteman </PERSON> told the sometimes hostile crowd. `` But we damn well tell the truth.'' The response was boos and catcalls from half the audience. <PERSON> Whiteman </PERSON> focused on the Sept. 29 incident that led to the closing of Building 771, the main production facility at the nuclear weapons plant. The three people inhaled plutonium in their noses. The shutdown of the plant, and reports of problems at other facilities in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> and elsewhere, have prompted a national debate on the safety of nuclear defense plants. <PERSON> Whiteman </PERSON> said the three people walked into Room 114 without wearing required respirators, did n't see a warning sign and so walked near a bin storing plutonium waste. But then he said the bin never released plutonium in the air, which prompted confusion about why the trio was exposed to plutonium. His answer was that it's not uncommon for <ORGANIZATION> Rocky </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Flats </ORGANIZATION> to operate at 1 percent of the maximum allowable airborne radiation limit. Audience members said they could n't understand why the building was shut down if the exposure to plutonium was so minor, a tiny fraction of what the average Coloradan is exposed to daily simply by living here. Officials are cleaning up the airborne radioactivity while the building is closed, <PERSON> Whiteman </PERSON> said. The building is expected to reopen in a few weeks. `` We want to control it so once the building is clean, it will stay clean,'' he said.

 Two Marine Corps helicopters crashed in a desert gunnery range during a training excercise, killing all 10 servicemen aboard, officials said today. It was not immediately known whether the two helicopters collided, said Cpl. <PERSON> Darren </PERSON> <PERSON> Fuller </PERSON>, a public affairs spokesman at the <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Station </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Yuma </LOCATION>. It was the second crash involving military helicopters this week. The aircraft were being used in a `` troop insertion exercise'' with crews using night-vision goggles when the crash occurred, said <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> Maj. <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Dumoulin </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> duty officer. Four people were on a <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> CH-46 helicopter and six on a Bell UH-1N copter. Both helicopters are designed to carry more troops but were not transporting full teams for the exercise, which <PERSON> Dumoulin </PERSON> said was part of a weapons-tactics instructor's course. There were no survivors, said <PERSON> Fuller </PERSON>. The copters went down in the remote desert site about 7:45 p.m. Tuesday approximately 125 miles southeast of the air station, said <PERSON> Fuller </PERSON>. An investigation team was at the site, he said. Names of the victims were being withheld pending notification of next of kin. <LOCATION> Yuma </LOCATION> is about 180 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION> on the <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>.

 Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> said today the Soviets have agreed to release all people regarded in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> as political prisoners within the next 10 weeks. Such a move would be one of the most dramatic signs yet from Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> that he seeks a definitive break with past Soviet human rights practices, which have included the confinement of people who disagree publicly with <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> policy. Soviet <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Gennady </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON> refused to confirm or deny that a release of political prisoners was in the offing. <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON> said the number of political prisoners in the country was about two dozen. However, political rights groups say there are about 200 political prisoners in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. The White House said it was seeking further details, and a leader of a group seeking emigration of Soviet Jews said he was `` skeptical'' of the reported promise. <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON> told a news briefing the issue of political prisoners was not on the agenda of Soviet-West German negotiations that brought <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> held 10 hours of talks with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and other top Soviet officials. At a news conference, <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> told reporters that during the talks `` the Soviets confirmed that they will release before the end of the year all political prisoners as we understand it in the West.'' When asked how many people that could involve, Foreign Minister <PERSON> Hans-Dietrich </PERSON> <PERSON> Genscher </PERSON> of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> replied, `` We are not in a position to give final figures.'' <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>, the London-based human rights group, said last month the number of people imprisoned in Soviet labor camps, psychiatric hospitals or exiled for their political beliefs numbered about 200, compared to 10,000 a few years ago. In January, Soviet human rights activist <PERSON> Andrei </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> gave <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> a list of 200 Soviets he said were imprisoned because of their political or religious views. Many Western governments have given lists to the Soviets of people they regard as jailed or held in psychiatric institutions for their political or religious beliefs. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, Deputy White House Press Secretary <PERSON> Roman </PERSON> <PERSON> Popadiuk </PERSON> said, `` We have seen the news reports. We are awaiting further details. If true, it is something we would look forward to.'' In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, the chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> on Soviet Jewry, <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> <PERSON> Abram </PERSON>, said he was skeptical of the reported Soviet promise. `` One will have to wait to see whether or not the promise is confirmed by the practice,'' <PERSON> Abram </PERSON> told The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. `` I am skeptical because we've heard for a long time that the Soviets are going to obey the obligation to let everyone leave the country who wishes to leave. And that's just not happened,'' he said. When asked if the pledge had come from <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> himself, <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> said only it was made `` during the talks.'' Last year, Soviet authorities released at least 300 prisoners who were being held on charges such as anti-Soviet agitation and propaganda or slandering the Soviet state. Most Estonian and Lithuanian nationalists who were being imprisoned for their views have been released this year. The ruling <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and government are reviewing the Soviet penal code, and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has repeatedly urged that the Soviets abolish those laws most often used to hold political dissenters. Soviet officials contend the law under which they were charged, forbidding dissemination of anti-Soviet propaganda or agitation, is being softened in the revision of the Soviet criminal code.

 A federal judge today dismissed the jury in the perjury trial of Rep. <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> because of fliers that the congressman had mailed out, making it unlikely <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> could be tried before Election Day. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Vining </PERSON> said he believed <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> violated court rules by sending out campaign mass mailings that reached residents who were potential jurors in the case both last week and this week. <PERSON> Vining </PERSON> said he was `` not inclined'' to use the only other avenue through which <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> could be tried before the election, a non-jury trial with <PERSON> Vining </PERSON> determining the verdict. But <PERSON> Vining </PERSON> left the door open to such a possibility, telling <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON>, `` I will call you in the morning and let you know if I've changed my mind. He said he was unlikely to do so, but added, `` Judges are wont to change their minds.'' No date was immediately set for the selection of a new jury, if the judge does not change his mind about a non-jury trial. <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON>, 38, was indicted Oct. 17 on 10 perjury counts. The charges cited his statements to a grand jury about his dealings with a an undercover <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> agent posing as a money broker, and <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> businessman <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> LeChasney </PERSON>, who already has pleaded guilty to money laundering charges that do not involve <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON>. <PERSON> Vining </PERSON> had copies of two mass mailings, one of which was dated after the time that he ordered <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> to obey local court rules on his comments outside the courtroom. Copies of the mailings were not immediately available, but <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> said one was headlined, `` Why did Congrssman <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> ask to be indicted?'' Prosecutor <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> Gillen </PERSON> said <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> should not be allowed to keep up such mailings `` under the guise of running a political campaign.'' `` If Mr. <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> prefers to run for office, he ca n't have his cake and eat it too,'' <PERSON> Gillen </PERSON> said. `` If he wants to send these mailings out, let's have the trial in December or November, and have it in an orderly fashion.'' Pounding the rostrum as he addressed <PERSON> Vining </PERSON>, <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> said, `` I find it absolutely incredible that the government tells me and the voters of the 4th District that I have to make a choice between running for re-election and coming down here and having this trial.'' <PERSON> Vining </PERSON> had warned both sides prior to the trial that if they said anything outside the courtroom that would affect the trial he would take action. He did not place any specific subject areas off limits, but he seemed particularly upset that one of the mailings had referred to <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON>'s claim that he had passed a polygraph test. After <PERSON> Vining </PERSON> dismissed the jury, <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> said he was `` deeply disappointed by the turn of events today.'' He said <PERSON> Vining </PERSON>'s comment that he could change his mind was `` a ray of hope.'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Barr </PERSON> declined to comment on <PERSON> Vining </PERSON>'s ruling. Opening arguments by <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON>, a lawyer who is representing himself, and <PERSON> Gillen </PERSON> had been set for today. A jury had been seated Tuesday. <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> was so anxious about the trial's pace Tuesday morning that he suggested giving up his right to a jury, but <PERSON> Vining </PERSON> quickly rejected that idea. Polls show the two-term <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> congressman from suburban <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> faces a tough re-election bid against Democrat <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> in the Nov. 8 election. In his appearance before a grand jury in February, <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON>, who was looking for an $ 850,000 home mortgage, said he did not recall being told the money broker's backers might be laundering illegal drug proceeds. The government, which secretly recorded several meetings, charges <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> lied in his account. <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON>'s questioning of prospective jurors revealed that he may call former presidential candidate Rep. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.Y. </LOCATION>, to the witness stand. <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> asked two former <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> residents who were on the panel of prospective jurors if they knew <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>, who ran unsuccessfully for the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> presidential nomination this year. Neither of the two was chosen as a juror. <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> later said he is considering calling <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> to testify. He said he will decide later based on how the government presents its case. <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON>, who was a co-chairman of <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>'s presidential campaign in <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, said last week he might call some members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and administration officials as character witnesses.

 Fewer than half of 1 percent of health care workers mistakenly exposed to AIDS-tainted blood through cuts, needle wounds or other accidents become infected with the lethal virus, a new survey shows. The review, conducted at 335 hospitals across the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, concludes that `` the risk of HIV infection after exposure to the blood of a patient infected with HIV is low.'' The risk of catching AIDS from patients is a serious concern in many hospitals. The latest research confirms earlier studies showing that while this threat is slight, on-the-job infection can happen. The researchers followed 1,201 nurses and other hospital workers who came into contact with the blood of people infected with HIV, the AIDS virus. A report on the work, directed by <PERSON> Ruthanne </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcus </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, was published in this week's New England Journal of Medicine. Results of AIDS testing were available for 963 of the health care workers, and four of them, or 0.42 percent, were infected as a result of needle sticks. Two of the four cases occurred when people were accidentally stuck with needles by fellow workers during emergency resuscitation procedures. Among the report's findings: _ Sixty-three percent of the potential AIDS exposures occurred in nurses, 14 percent in doctors and medical students, 11 percent in lab technicians, 7 percent in people drawing blood, 3 percent in respiratory therapists and 2 percent in housekeeping and maintenance workers _ Eight percent of the exposures resulted from needle sticks The rest were cuts with sharp objects, open wound contamination and exposure to mucous membranes. _ Thirty-seven percent of the exposures could have been prevented if routine precautions had been followed The researchers said their work `` underscores the need to handle sharp instruments carefully in all circumstances, even during emergencies.'' In a separate report in the journal, researchers reported on the high rate of AIDS infection at a hospital in <LOCATION> Kinshasa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Zaire </LOCATION>. They said there was no evidence that the health care workers had gotten their infections on the job, because the infection rate was the same among those with heavy contact with patients and those who rarely saw patients. The research, conducted by Dr. <PERSON> Bosenge </PERSON> <PERSON> N'Galy </PERSON> and colleagues from Project SIDA, was based on AIDS infection tests given to 2,002 workers at <LOCATION> Mama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Yemo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>.

 <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> declared today the `` pollsters are not going to call the election'' and heard Hispanic leaders say that a heavy voter turnout by their constituents could deliver a Democratic upset on Election Day. The Democratic presidential nominee had breakfast with Hispanic leaders in <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> the morning after he said during in a 90-minute interview on <ORGANIZATION> ABC-TV </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Nightline'' that he was making `` real progess'' against <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> rival <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. Most national polls suggest otherwise. `` The pollsters are not going to call the election,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> told reporters in a statement. `` It's people who are going to be voting.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> claimed overwhelming support among Hispanics, which he said stemmed from his longstanding commitment to minority issues, especially the war against drugs. `` They want a president who does n't talk about the subject but who has done something about it,'' the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor said. The Hispanic leaders praised <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> for his commitment to civil and voting rights, affirmative action, urban renewal and economic development. They said Hispanics are grossly under-represented in presidential polls, and that a 70 percent turnout among them could swing a close election in <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' favor. Rep. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Bustamante </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> saluted <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> as both a `` technocrat'' and the `` liberal of 1988.'' He said this meant <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> cared children, the elderly, health care and the environment. When <PERSON> Bustamante </PERSON> used the word technocrat, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> grinned and chimed in `` 15 percent.'' The candidate did not take questions from reporters. During his TV interview with <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Koppel </PERSON>, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said conceded he was partly to blame for not answering early <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> campaign attacks on his record. But he claimed he was gaining on the vice president despite new polls showing he was trailing <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> by double-digit margins. `` I feel good about things,'' he said in the nationally televised interview. `` I think we're making some real progress.'' After the program <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> told reporters he thought the interview was `` great, terrific.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was campaigning in <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> today and planned to keep a high television profile in the remaining days of the campaign, including an interview with <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday and <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> on Friday. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was questioned on a broad range of issues during the `` Nightline'' appearance, giving the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration some credit for winning arms control agreements with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> while denouncing the administration _ and specifically <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> _ for failing in the war on drugs. `` I'm willing to get much, much tougher than this administration'' in the drug fight, he said. But he reiterated his opposition to capital punishment regardless of the offense. It was not until well into the interview that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> raised the issue he has been focusing on in his speeches in recent days: <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s support of a capital gains tax credit that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> characterizes as a boon for the rich, including the vice president himself, that will result in an added burden on average Americans <PERSON> Koppel </PERSON>, after referring to the latest polls, asked <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> what <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had done to `` nail your hide to the wall thus far.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> did not dispute the characterization before blaming his position in the polls on a relentlessly negative <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> campaign and his failure to counterattack. `` The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign made a very careful and deliberate decision way back in the spring to run a tough, attacking, negative campaign and they've been doing it ever since. And perhaps I responded too late, perhaps I should have been out there attacking or counterattacking from the beginning,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. `` They questioned my patriotism, they questioned my wife's patriotism ... they questioned my health and that kind of thing has made this a tough and difficult campaign. He accused BUsh of ducking the issues by running a campaign `` loaded with distortion ad misrepresentation and falsehoods.'' Two polls released Tuesday night reported <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> held a double-digit lead in the presidential race with only two weeks to Election Day. A <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News-New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> survey of 1,287 probable voters showed <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> leading <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> 54-41 percent while a Gallup poll of 815 likely voters showed <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> up by 14 points, 53-3 percent. The CBS-Times poll was conducted Friday through Monday and had a margin of error of three points. The Gallup survey was done Friday through Sunday and had a four-point error margin. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said his own instincts indicated voters were turning against the Republican campaign tactics, however. Asked about the polls after the television interview, he said simply, `` Forging ahead.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> came to <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> after spending Tuesday morning campaigning in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, where he took issue with a <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> campaign commercial ridiculing him for riding in an Army tank. `` We Democrats are for a strong defense,'' he said. `` That's nonsense,'' he said of the ad's assertion that he has opposed virtually all new proposed weapons systems

<HEAD>Obstetric Committee Says Caesarean Births Should No Longer Be
Routine</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Guidelines issued today by the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Obstetricians </ORGANIZATION> and Gynecologists say women who have had babies delivered by Caesarean section should be encouraged to have later children by normal, vaginal birth. Dr. <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Jo </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Sullivan </PERSON>, a member of an <ORGANIZATION> ACOG </ORGANIZATION> panel that developed the guidelines, said a pregnant women who has had an earlier child by Caesarean section `` should be encouraged to attempt labor in her current pregnancy'' instead of routinely undergoing a second surgical delivery. `` This is the first time in over 70 years we are saying that a patient who has had a C-section should not have a repeat C-section unless there is a definite medical need,'' she said at a news conference. The significant shift of emphasis stems from a gradual increase of statistical data that shows mothers and babies generally fare better with vaginal delivery _ even if the mother has previously had a low transverse incision C-section, she said. As with any surgical procedure, C-sections are more costly than natural delivery and raise the prospect of the same type of potential complications always attendant surgery, such as infections and reactions to anthesia. Dr. <PERSON> O'Sullivan </PERSON> said if the new guidelines are accepted by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> hospitals, they will go a long way toward ending the `` once a C-section, always a C-section'' tradition that has guided obstetric practice since 1916. The <ORGANIZATION> ACOG </ORGANIZATION> committee found that women who have had a C-section by the low-transverse method were successful in subsequent vaginal delivery attempts in most cases. `` Up to 70 percent of these women who had their first Caesarean birth because of failure to progress in a long and difficult labor were able to deliver vaginally with their second child,'' Dr. <PERSON> O'Sullivan </PERSON> said. Since 1982, the <ORGANIZATION> ACOG </ORGANIZATION> has urged physicians to encourage women to attempt vaginal deliveries even after prior C-sections. The action was taken after a number of studies indicated that mortality rates for mother and child were lower among women who attempted labor than among those who chose repeated Caesarean births. Until recent years, it was believed that once a woman had had a C-section, all subsequent children had to be delivered the same way. The number of C-sections routinely performed in recent years, however, has declined and the new guidelines are intended to encourage this trend. In 1987, about 24.4 percent of all live births, or 934,000 of 3.8 million, were performed by C-section. About 35 percent of the surgical births were repeat C-sections. The surgical procedure would continue to be used where medically indicated, such as for some breech births, when there are signs that the baby is in distress, or following a difficult and prolonged attempt at labor. The <ORGANIZATION> ACOG </ORGANIZATION> announcement said C-sections will continue to be used for women who have had a previous `` classical'' Caesarean. In this procedure, the uterus is incised vertically, a technique now rarely used. About 99 percent of all C-sections now use a transverse incision which goes from one side to the other, instead of up and down.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> defense ministers begin a series of talks Thursday that will focus on whether the alliance needs more powerful nuclear weapons for front-line combat. Since the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> signed a treaty in December to eliminate medium-range nuclear weapons, much attention has shifted to upgrading short-range nuclear artillery and missiles. The talks of the Brussels-based <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, which begin at <LOCATION> The </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hague </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION>, will focus on whether the Western alliance should modernize these forces. A Dutch defense specialist, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told reporters in The Hague that the talks will `` make an inventory of our options.'' The source said the discussions would provide Gen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Galvin </PERSON>, commander of <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> forces in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, with guidelines for making a decision in 1989 or 1990. Most <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> nations want to extend the range of the short-range tactical weapons to make up for the loss of weapons under the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces treaty. That pact eliminated all <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet land-based missiles with ranges from 300 to 3,000 miles. The range of a new generation of weapons would likely be extended up to the treaty limits of about 300 miles, analysts say. A key candidate for upgrading is the Lance surface-to-surface missile, which was introduced in 1972 and which military analysts say will be obsolete by 1995. The Lance has a range of just over 62 miles, but a new system might boost that above 248 miles. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kingdom </LOCATION> have indicated support for modernizing the short-range weapons. But <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION>, which have strong anti-nuclear movements, have argued that such a decision is not yet needed. The defense ministers, meeting as <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>'s Nuclear Planning Group, gather twice a year. Fourteen of <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>'s 16 members will take part in the talks. <LOCATION> Iceland </LOCATION> attends only as an observer, and <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> operates outside <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>'s common military planning. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Defense Secretary <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> will represent the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 Food fights are a faux pas at the elegant tables of <ORGANIZATION> Tiffany </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION>, where moppets sip instead of slurp from the finest crystal and china. `` At first, they have looks on their faces like, ` My mother made me do this,''' said <PERSON> Annie </PERSON> <PERSON> Cater </PERSON>, who runs table manners classes for <ORGANIZATION> Tiffany </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in seven cities. `` But by the time the class is over, the little boys are seating everybody at the graduation party and the kids are toasting one another.'' In the past two years, Ms. <PERSON> Cater </PERSON> has helped polish the table manners of more than 900 children and adults, including executives concerned about which fork to use at important business lunches. It all started with the kids. `` A friend said, ` I want you to teach my Brownie class some etiquette.' So I got the -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Tiffany </ORGANIZATION>'s etiquette -RRB- book, the silver, crystal and china. I had 28 8-year-olds in my face. I almost died,'' she recalled. She succeeded, though, and went on to convince <PERSON> Tiffany </PERSON>'s that it could market the concept. Now, there are 109 kids, ages 8 to 16, on the waiting list in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>, and classes are springing up in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mesa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION> `` They learn not to shout across the table, to pass the salt over their arm _ things they'll remember,'' said Ms. Cater. `` I think it's -LRB- successful -RRB- because I'm not their mother. There's no peer pressure. I make it very comfortable for them.'' `` It's just such fun. Children are fascinating,'' she added. And unpredictable. `` I was on live TV with a little boy. I said, ` <PERSON> Jason </PERSON> tell everybody what this is.' `` He said, ` It's a finger bowl.' `` I said, ` Do you have those at home?' `` He said, ` Yes. My father drinks margaritas out of those.''' Most kids first guess the bowl holds lemonade or soup. But soon, they're dunking their pinkies like pros. `` We do use <PERSON> Tiffany </PERSON> china, crystal and silver,'' said Ms. Cater. `` We've had a couple of things spilled, but nothing broken. I think they know when they come in here that it's special and precious. Once they hold it, they're going to like it.'' After learning the basics in a class of 12 during two hour-long sessions at the store, the students dress up for a graduation meal at a hotel. Afterward, Ms. Cater often gets thank-you notes. One boy wrote: `` Now, I can eat with the kings.'' `` What makes me feel so good about it is they go home and they use the things they've learned. Even if they're going to <PERSON> McDonald </PERSON>'s that night, they remember that their bread and butter plate is on the left and their glass on the right. Adults are flocking to the classes, too _ learning the rudiments of napkin-folding and olive-nibbling at mock dinners and cocktail parties. `` If you're out in the business world and do n't have good table manners you'll be in trouble,'' said Ms. Cater. `` If you know what fork you're going to use, then you can listen to the business conversation, enjoy the food and what's going on around you.'' The lesson price differs, depending on the city. In <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>, it's $ 65 for children and $ 100 for adults

<HEAD>Thatcher to Try for Unprecedented Fourth Term</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>, already the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION>'s longest-serving leader after nearly a decade in power, says she will seek an unprecedented fourth term, a newspaper reported Wednesday. The 63-year-old Conservative chief of state said she planned to lead her party into the next election and remain prime minister for another five-year term if it wins, according to an interview in the Times of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. The election must be held by 1992. The Conservatives named Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> prime minister in May 1979 after they defeated a <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> government.

The predominantly <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> is fighting to end British rule in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> and unite the 60 percent <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> province with the 95 percent <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <LOCATION> Irish </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>. Asked about possible <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> interviews with foreign-based satellite television stations due to broadcast in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> next year, Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> said: `` The only thing we could do here is to make it an offense to beam such stuff into this country if need be.''

 Two Soviet icebreakers flying <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> flags worked today to smash through an ice ridge as dawn approached on what rescuers hope will be freedom day for two whales imprisoned in ice for nearly three weeks. `` The whales seemed to be doing fine,'' Rear Adm. <PERSON> Sigmund </PERSON> <PERSON> Petersen </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oceanic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atmospheric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> said this morning. `` It's like they expected something to be happening. Everything seems to be coming together.'' Rescuers had one of their best days yet Tuesday as the unprecedented international effort to save the two <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> gray whales neared a climax. They succeeded in moving the huge mammals around a shoal that had stymied progress for three days. As darkness fell Tuesday, the mammals were only about two miles from the water being opened by the Soviet ships. The whales could be free by late this afternoon if things go as well today as they did the day before, said <ORGANIZATION> NOAA </ORGANIZATION> rescue coordinator <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Morris </PERSON>. `` We feel very good about it,'' <PERSON> Petersen </PERSON> said this morning. `` The cooperation has just been fantastic. The Soviets came in here with a very positive attitude and went to work immediately.'' Later today, rescuers planned to use a tractor-like device propelled by pontoon augers to cut the relatively thin ice remaining between the whales and the icebreakers' farthest advance. `` We certainly hope it will end today,'' <PERSON> Petersen </PERSON> said. `` We are just hoping that things are just coming together.'' In another development Tuesday, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Admininistration </ORGANIZATION> ordered flights around Barrow Point to stay above 2,000 feet because of crowding by small planes taking a look at the whales, The <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> said. Around noon Tuesday, <PERSON> Morris </PERSON>, <PERSON> Petersen </PERSON> and Capt. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> McClelland </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> flew to the icebreaker Admiral <PERSON> Makarov </PERSON> as it waited about 25 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Barrow </LOCATION>. After a perfunctory briefing, the icebreaker's skipper said he was ready to begin work immediately. `` We shall commence just now,'' said <PERSON> Sergei </PERSON> <PERSON> Fedorovich </PERSON> <PERSON> Reshetov </PERSON>. `` In five minutes, our engines will be ready.'' The 440-foot icebreaker, an American flag flying above its frost-encrusted superstructure, quickly cruised through thin ice to the pressure ridge that is the last significant barrier to freedom. In just a few hours, the ship had battled almost three-fourths of the way through the ridge, a jumble of ice blocks as big as small houses. With only about 100 yards to go, the Admiral <PERSON> Makarov </PERSON>, which draws about 40 feet of water, nearly ran out of room. <PERSON> McClelland </PERSON> said he thought the ship nudged the seabed from time to time. The plan was for the 496-foot <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> Arseniev </PERSON>, an ice-breaking cargo ship which draws only about 20 feet, to finish the job. Rescuers, however, did not think the smaller ship could go all the way to the whales. The Admiral <PERSON> Makarov </PERSON> ran its bow up over the ice, shuddering only slightly as its 20,000 tons broke through thicknesses of 6 to 8 feet. Spidery cracks raced in all directions outward from the ship as it battered its way through ice blanketed with snow bearing the tracks of polar bears. The vessel repeated the maneuver again and again, leaving millions of dirty ice cubes as rubble. `` It's a magnificent ship,'' <PERSON> Petersen </PERSON> said as he watched the icebreaker work. `` With the wind going as it is, it could n't be better,'' <PERSON> McClelland </PERSON> said. Rescuers counted on a steady east wind and prevailing currents to carry debris left by the icebreakers out of the whales' path. Meanwhile, chain saw-wielding <ORGANIZATION> Eskimos </ORGANIZATION> cut a detour for the whales to swim around shallow water through which the animals had refused to pass. By cutting breathing holes in deeper water away from the shoal, the Eskimos were able to lure the whales about two miles from the place where they were found. A third whale disappeared Friday and is believed dead. The icebreakers had been returning to their home port of <LOCATION> Vladivostok </LOCATION> when they were diverted, said <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Patzevich </PERSON>, chief officer and second in command. The vessels dropped off personnel and 1,000 tons of equipment to establish a floating polar research station last week. Although the Admiral <PERSON> Makarov </PERSON> has been at sea for six months and `` everybody is tired,'' none of the crew of 78 has complained about the diversion, <PERSON> Patzevich </PERSON> said. `` It's very nice to work together,'' he said of the U.S.-Soviet effort. The North Slope Borough helicopter that flew whale-rescue team members to the icebreaker took <PERSON> Reshetov </PERSON> and several crew members to see the whales. First Mate <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> Moroz </PERSON>, who said he was the ship's political officer, said the Soviets were happy to help. He said he spoke to a <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> newspaper by telephone on Monday. `` They're receiving many, many calls asking about the whales,'' <PERSON> Moroz </PERSON> said. `` Our country is watching like everyone else. We love animals, just as everyone.'' <PERSON> Moroz </PERSON> said another Soviet icebreaker helped free a pod of beluga whales trapped in <LOCATION> Bering </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> ice across from <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> three years ago. The Admiral <PERSON> Makarov </PERSON> bore a gold-colored hammer and sickle on its smokestack, and a Soviet flag flew from the stern. <PERSON> McClelland </PERSON> said the captain's decision to fly a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> flag was a common courtesy. `` Normally, a merchant ship will fly the flag of the country it's working in,'' he said Small airplanes crowding the skies over the whales prompted the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> restriction. `` To have these airplanes swarming around like little bees over the rescue operations turns into a nightmare on the ground,'' <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Steucke </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman in <LOCATION> Anchorage </LOCATION>, told the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>. `` In addition, it's one heck of a hazard in the sky. The opportunity to hit each other is quite high.'' Normally, there are two commercial flights in and out of <LOCATION> Barrow </LOCATION> each day.

<HEAD>In Home Stretch, Dukakis Turns to Proven Populist Themes</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JILL LAWRENCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 As his underdog campaign draws to a close, Democratic nominee <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is leaning on his party's traditional populist themes that put <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Truman </PERSON> over the top in 1948 and shifted millions of votes to <PERSON> Hubert </PERSON> <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON> in 1968 The <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor has touted his competence. He's boasted about his good judgment in selecting <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> as his vice presidential running mate He's attacked ethical lapses in the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration. And he's derided Republican rival <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> as the artificial creation of cynical handlers. But with his growing deficit in the polls and the increasing impatience of his supporters, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is finally homing in on a class-oriented, Easy Street vs. Main Street message that has served Democrats well in the past. `` The real question is, will we have a president who fights for the privileged few, or will we have a president who fights for you?'' he asks in a late October campaign advertisement typical of his new approach. `` <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> wants to give the wealthiest 1 percent of the people in this country a new tax break worth $ 30,000 a year,'' he says. `` I'm fighting for you and your family, for affordable housing and health care, for better jobs, for the best education and opportunity for our children.'' Democratic consultants with long memories can hardly conceal their elation. They say they've been urging <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> to take this tack for months. `` There's now been a shift to distinguishing what really makes the Democrats distinctive and different. We care about the average person. We believe government can have a constructive role in helping the average person,'' says <PERSON> Stuart </PERSON> <PERSON> Eizenstat </PERSON>, an unofficial adviser to the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign who formerly worked for <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON> and President <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>. `` It's very important for a <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> candidate to remind people who does what for them,'' says adviser <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Hunter </PERSON>, a foreign affairs specialist and a former <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON> speechwriter. `` The governor is catching up with the kind of strategy that can work for him and, let's hope better late than never, pays off,'' <PERSON> Hunter </PERSON> said. Twenty years ago, with <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON> lagging 15 points behind <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> three weeks before the 1968 election, pollster <PERSON> Vic </PERSON> <PERSON> Fingerhut </PERSON> wrote a memo that resonates eerily in 1988. <ORGANIZATION> Fingerhut </ORGANIZATION>'s advice to the <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON> campaign: Concentrate on voters likely to cross party lines -LRB- <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Wallace </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Nixon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> in 1968, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> Democrats in 1988 -RRB-. Reach them with short TV ads. Stress economic themes. Raise the specters of education and social spending cutbacks. And hammer home the idea that <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON> is `` a tough fighter for the common man.'' The memo cited findings that <PERSON> Truman </PERSON> won late votes because of economic concerns, not because he was a feisty underdog. `` People came to vote for <PERSON> Truman </PERSON> faster than they came to like him,'' <ORGANIZATION> Fingerhut </ORGANIZATION> wrote. His conclusion: forget about trying to make <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON> likable and go back to Democratic roots. According to <ORGANIZATION> Fingerhut </ORGANIZATION>, 8 million votes shifted to the vice president in the final three weeks before the 1968 election, most of them blue-collar and middle-class voters with socially conservative attitudes _ the same kinds of people <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> needs to attract. Fingerhut attributes 7 million of those votes to economic concerns. Others, such as <PERSON> Eizenstat </PERSON>, say part of the late rally was promoted by <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON>'s declaration of independence from President <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> on the Vietnam War, but they say economic issues were at least equally important. The <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> camp, their candidate more comfortable as a clean-government crusader than a class warrior, auditioned other messages for weeks. `` They tried real hard to re-invent the wheel and when they ended up, it was n't even round,'' said <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Payne </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> advertising executive who did primary spots for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. Now, in his speeches and commercials, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> talks of day care, family leave, education, jobs, trade, home ownership, health care and the struggles of two-earner families to keep up. `` He's on their side,'' he says of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and the wealthy. `` I'm on your side.'' Will wavering Democrats and independents respond to this late populist appeal? <PERSON> Eizenstat </PERSON> said those issues proved potent for <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON> in the face of a <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> assault that included the same charges of weak on defense and soft on crime that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is using against <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. `` Now that people are really focused on the -LRB- 1988 -RRB- campaign, they will respond to the very same bread-and-butter issues,'' <PERSON> Eizenstat </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has a few problems that <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON> did n't have. The Democratic majority of registered voters is smaller than it was in 1968, and party ties are weaker. <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON> was part of a Democratic administration, while <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is a non-Washington candidate who must convince voters that the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> needs a change of party. <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON> was further behind than <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> in the final stretch of the campaign, though his momentum by Election Day led many to believe that <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON> could have beaten <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> in a few more days. `` The <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON> and <PERSON> Truman </PERSON> models should be the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> model,'' says <ORGANIZATION> Fingerhut </ORGANIZATION>. `` If he follows those models he can win the election.''

<HEAD>Panel Begins Work To Define What Values To Teach In New Jersey

 A committee of educators, students and religious leaders has begun compiling a list of values to be taught in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> schools, starting with honesty, compassion, courage and hard work. The difficulty will be figuring out `` what else there is,'' said Gov. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kean </PERSON>, who ordered the group to come up with its recommendations by March. <PERSON> Kean </PERSON> announced his values-education campaign earlier this year. The committee began its work Tuesday. `` We're all aware of the fact this effort is going to be complex and is a little controversial,'' said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Herold </PERSON>, a lawyer and chairman of the 20-member panel. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> joins other states, including <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, working to bring values into public education despite wariness that it could violate constitutional principles of separation of church and state. The trend has been applauded by conservative groups as well as the civil liberties organization People for the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Way </ORGANIZATION>, which endorses values education as long as tolerance is one of the lessons stressed. `` There has been a growing consensus that students are n't born knowing the difference between right and wrong any more than they're born with the knowledge of calculus,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Crane </PERSON>, education issues director for People for the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Way </ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kean </LOCATION>, a Republican, lamented such disgraced national figures as former <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> aide <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Deaver </PERSON> and Wall Street giant <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON> <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON> Good citizenship, <PERSON> Kean </PERSON> said, is as important to teach as English and chemistry. `` What teachers tell me and counselors tell me again and again is there does n't seem to be anything these youth can put their faith in,'' <PERSON> Kean </PERSON> said, adding that `` amoral'' young people are easy marks for drug dealers. Values would not be taught in a single class, but would be laced through the curriculum from elementary grades to high school, Education Commissioner <PERSON> Saul </PERSON> <PERSON> Cooperman </PERSON> said. He suggested young students could be taught the sacredness of promises, for example, while older students could learn about the importance of crediting sources in English papers. Details, such as whether students would be graded on the values they learn, have yet to be determined. Teachers and administrators would have to teach by example, <PERSON> Cooperman </PERSON> said. `` We ca n't say, ` Do as I say, but do n't do as I do,''' he said. `` Kids see through that in five seconds.'' The panel chosen by <PERSON> Cooperman </PERSON> represents a wide range of geography and backgrounds and includes a rabbi, Baptist minister and <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> bishop. The only thing the members have in common is their own good citizenship, <PERSON> Kean </PERSON> said. A spokesman for a national youth advocacy group applauded <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>'s efforts but warned it would be a `` tricky wicket'' to produce a list that has both substance and universal acceptance. `` I think it's the kind of thing we need to weave into the educational experience,'' said <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Buscemi </PERSON>, senior vice president of the organization, <ORGANIZATION> Quest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Granville </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>. `` We have a lot of kids who are floundering and looking for direction.''

<HEAD>Unions Won Average 3.3 Percent First-Year Wage Hikes So Far This
Year</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 First-year base wage increases excluding cost-of-living adjustments or COLAs averaged 3.3 percent in major union contracts negotiated in the first nine months of this year, the government said Wednesday. Including COLAs but not lump-sum bonuses now prevalent in manufacturing, union workers under major contracts received effective pay increases averaging 3.5 percent over the past year, the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said. The average annual increase in the new contracts falls to 2.8 percent over their usual two-to-three-year lives, the <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Statistics </ORGANIZATION> said, indicating a return to so-called front-loaded contracts. Back-loaded contracts in which the biggest increases came closer to the expiration of the accords than at their beginning had dominated labor relations from the 1981-82 recession until last year, according to government figures. Eighty percent of the some 1.4 million workers covered in major contracts negotiated so far in 1988 received first-year increases in their base pay, the bureau said. Eighteen percent accepted wage freezes, and 2 percent gave up pay concessions. The bureau said 35 percent of those covered in contracts negotiated from January through September of this year received first-year wage adjustments of between 2 percent and 4 percent. Twenty-eight percent of the covered workers received base pay adjustments between 4 percent and 6 percent. Adjustments of less that 2 percent went to 14 percent of the covered workers in new contracts while 3 percent received first-year adjustments greater than 6 percent of their base wage. Including those who agreed to wage freezes or concessions in the first year of newly negotiated contracts, the average base wage increase in the first year of newly negotiated contracts was 2.5 percent, the government said. The cost-of-living adjustments or COLAs designed to adjust wages to reflect changes in consumer prices were introduced or reestablished for about 11 percent or 161,000 of the covered workers under settlements reached so far this year. The government said virtually all of them are Teamsters covered by the National Master Freight Agreement negotiated last spring. The new three-year trucking industry contract reestablish a COLA that had been suspended during the past accord. As a result, the government said, the proportion of union workers covered by COLA protections in their contracts has climbed from 38 percent at the end of 1987 to 40 percent as of Oct. 1. In the 1970s, more than half of all union workers had COLA provisions in their contracts. Both COLAs and lump-sum bonuses continue to be more prevalent in manufacturing than service industries. Labor contracts with manufacturers now provide some 51 percent of the covered workers with lump-sum bonuses ranging from $ 200 up to $ 10,000 a year and 62 percent of the workers with COLA. For union workers in non-manufacturing industries, only 10 percent get bonuses and 26 percent have <ORGANIZATION> COLA </ORGANIZATION> protections, the government said.

Some convicted killers were granted furloughs during <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' administration, and the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign has made frequent reference to one of them, <PERSON> Willie </PERSON> <PERSON> Horton </PERSON>, who subsequently raped a woman in <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> The furlough program has since been changed to exclude first-degree murderers. <PERSON> Stuart </PERSON> <PERSON> Piper </PERSON>, executive director of the state <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, said he was surprised by the letter. `` We did n't know if the letter was from -LRB- <PERSON> Gacy </PERSON> -RRB- and we did n't feel that it dignified any public response,'' <ORGANIZATION> Piper </ORGANIZATION> said. `` Apparently, he felt differently and released it to the media himself.''

 The government is wondering whether to give folks who buy goods by telephone the same protections already available to mail-order shoppers. The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> several years ago set up consumer-protection rules for people buying by mail. Among other things those regulations require the seller to ship the product within 30 days, unless the buyer agrees to a delay, and set rules for refunds and other consumer protections. With telephone sales now growing enormously, the <ORGANIZATION> FTC </ORGANIZATION> announced that it is considering extending the mail-order rules to include telephone orders and other new telemarketing technologies. The agency is accepting public comments until Dec. 27.

 Saying he was tired of being a `` mystery man,'' the father of a 9-year-old girl came forward today and disclosed that he's told his daughter of a <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> couple's claim to be her rightful parents The couple alleges the girl was born to them but was switched with an ailing child soon after birth at a <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> hospital. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Mays </PERSON>, a 43-year-old salesman, held a news conference at his lawyer's office and said he told his daughter <PERSON> Kimberly </PERSON> <PERSON> Michelle </PERSON> about the case last week. <PERSON> Mays </PERSON>, who has remained silent while trying to protect his daughter, said he was worried she might learn about the case from someone else. `` I was tired of living a lie. ... I saw no reason to keep it secret from her any longer,'' he said. <PERSON> Mays </PERSON>' name, which has been known to the media, had been voluntarily withheld in published reports to protect the child. <PERSON> Mays </PERSON> thanked reporters for their consideration. `` I had hoped this scenario would go some other way,'' <PERSON> Mays </PERSON> said, adding that he has no reason to believe that <PERSON> Regina </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ernest </PERSON> <PERSON> Twigg </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Langhorne </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, will stop pursuing their claim. He said his daughter took the news of the months-long legal battle very well. `` She's an intelligent little girl ... well-adjusted. She's a totally loved child and well taken care of.'' The child's mother died of cancer when she was 3 -LCB-. The Twiggs maintain that their daughter, a healthy girl, was deliberately switched in the nursery at <ORGANIZATION> Hardee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Memorial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Wauchula </LOCATION> shortly after birth, and they were given a sickly child. Hospital workers then altered records to hide the swap, they allege. The girl they raised, <PERSON> Arlena </PERSON>, died in August from a heart defect. The Twiggs say <PERSON> Kimberly </PERSON> was born at <ORGANIZATION> Hardee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Memorial </ORGANIZATION> in late 1978 at about the same time as <PERSON> Arlena </PERSON>. The Twiggs say genetic tests this summer revealed <PERSON> Arlena </PERSON> was not their biological daughter. They filed a $ 100 million suit against the hospital and some of its employees and persuaded the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> to investigate. The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>, however, failed to find sufficient evidence that federal laws had been violated. The Twiggs have asked a court for genetic testing to determine if <PERSON> Kimberly </PERSON> has the same blood type as theirs. <PERSON> Mays </PERSON> said he was reluctant to submit <PERSON> Kimberly </PERSON> to such a test because of mere speculation. He said the Twiggs have presented no evidence to show that <PERSON> Kimberly </PERSON> could be their daughter. When the whole situation began to unfold, <PERSON> Mays </PERSON> said he could n't believe it `` I thought it was a terrible joke,'' he said today. `` It was like a fairy tale. ... Only recently I've been honest enough with myself to realize this is n't going to go away.''

 <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> insisted today he is making `` real progress'' and shrugged off a double-digit deficit in new polls. Republican <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said his proposed capital gains tax cut is `` not a tax break for the rich.'' `` The pollsters are not going to call the election,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said in a statement to reporters in <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>. `` It's people who are going to be voting.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> met with Hispanic leaders in tossup <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> before traveling to <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> defended his proposal to slash the capital gains tax on profits from stocks, real estate and other assets from its current level of 28 percent down to 15 percent. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has denounced it as a tax break for the wealthy and said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> personally would reap a $ 22,000 advantage a year. `` It is not a tax break for the rich. It is a break for those who want to have a job in this country and I am for it,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> declared. `` Unfortunately, my opponent's only experience with business is regulating it and taxing it.'' President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> ventured into the Democratic stronghold of <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> and noted the Democrats' complaints about the negative tone of the campaign. `` Well, I think they're squirming because <PERSON> George </PERSON> has shown <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> how far outside the mainstream they really are,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said. Republican vice presidential candidate <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> campaigning for <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> candidate <PERSON> Connie </PERSON> <PERSON> Mack </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, talked as though the election were over. He noted the difficulty of a White House that has to deal with an opposition-controlled <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. `` When you're in the minority, the majority controls the gavel. They're able to set the agenda in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said With less than two weeks remaining until Election Day, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> insisted in a late-night television interview Tuesday that there was still time for him to overtake front-runner <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. But when asked shortly after the program about polls showing him trailing by 13 and 14 percentage points, the Democratic nominee simply replied, `` Forging ahead.'' In the 90-minute interview on <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Nightline,'' questioner <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Koppel </PERSON> asked <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> what <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had done to `` nail your hide to the wall thus far.'' The Democratic nominee failed to challenge <PERSON> Koppel </PERSON>'s assessment of the White House race before answering the question `` Two things,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. `` The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign made a very careful and deliberate decision way back in the spring to run a tough, attacking, negative campaign. And they've been doing it ever since and perhaps I responded too late, perhaps I should have been out there attacking or counterattacking from the beginning.'' He also criticized <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> advertising and charged <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> with running a campaign `` loaded with distortion and misrepresentation and falsehoods.'' Earlier Tuesday, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> defended his campaign ads against the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> attacks. `` Because he was trying to run away from his record, I have factually pointed out where he stands on the record,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said during a campaign stop in <LOCATION> Akron </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>. `` And I am not going to be deterred. I am going to keep doing that honestly, factually.'' The vice president, targeting a must-win <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> state, told an audience in <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, that the election is a referendum on peace and prosperity and that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is too inexperienced to be president. `` We can not gamble <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s future on a president who has n't had one single day's experience in national defense matters or foreign affairs,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. Polls released Tuesday suggested that the Democratic ticket faces a difficult task in its quest for the White House. A <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News-New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> survey of 1,287 probable voters showed <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> leading <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> 54-41 percent while a Gallup poll of 815 likely voters showed <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> up by 14 points, 53-39 percent. The CBS-Times poll was conducted Friday through Monday and had a margin of error of three points. The Gallup survey was done Friday through Sunday and had a four-point error margin. As part of their uphill fight, the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign released four new TV ads which ask voters to imagine a world where children can play without fear of drug dealers, where the elderly are no longer a burden, where a single paycheck pays the bills and where <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> is No. 1 in competition on foreign markets. All four ads end with the phrase, `` Dukakis-Bentsen. The best <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> is yet to come.'' The ads are scheduled to begin airing on Thursday in spot markets around the country, said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> spokeswoman <PERSON> Lorraine </PERSON> <PERSON> Voles </PERSON>. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign also released an ad alleging that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> misled 62 million Americans when he denied during the last presidential debate that he raided his state pension system to balance the budget. The ad's narrator concludes: `` And <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> says <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is running a campaign of lies? <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is unbelievable.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> aides said they did not know where or when the commercials will air. In addition to advertising, the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign is filling the airwaves with none other than <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>. The Democratic nominee will appear on the `` CBS Evening News'' Thursday for a 14-minute interview with <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Rather </PERSON> and also appear on <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> with anchor <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Brokaw </PERSON> for a series next week on the candidate's positions <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> is scheduled to appear on the CBS program tonight. The <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign also had bought five minutes of time on the network Sunday night for a spot the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> senator will likely tape today in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> kept up his attack Tuesday on what he called <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> distortions of the Democratic record. `` The kind of campaign these Republicans are waging would tear the heart out of a democracy,'' he told a rally in <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Falls </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mont </LOCATION>.

 The Atlanta Journal on Wednesday endorsed Republican <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> for president, arguing that the vice president represents `` leadership with proven results in foreign policy, at the pay window and at income tax time.'' The Journal's sister newspaper, The <ORGANIZATION> Atlanta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Constitution </ORGANIZATION>, last week endorsed Democratic presidential nominee <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>.

His uncompromising stands against crime and for the enhancement of families contrast well with liberal social experimentation.''

 Republican <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> today portrayed <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> as the odd man out in opposing a reduction in capital gains taxes, and said his <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> opponent is `` just itching to repeal'' income tax cuts enacted in President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s first term. Fortified by new polls showing him with a double-digit lead, the vice president attacked <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> at a luncheon sponsored by the <ORGANIZATION> Detroit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> and the Women's <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>. Playing it safe, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> stuck to time-tested themes. The <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> nominee has proposed slashing the capital gains tax on profits from stocks, real estate and other assets from its current top of 33 percent to 15 percent. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> denounced it as a tax break for the wealthy and said it would give <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> himself a $ 22,000 tax break annually. Defending his plan as a way to spur investments and create jobs, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` Over the years, it's been endorsed by everyone from <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> to <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> to my running mate, <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, to <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> is <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' vice presidential running mate. `` It is not a tax break for the rich. It is a break for those who want to have a job in this country and I am for it,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` Unfortunately, my opponent's only experience with business is regulating it and taxing it,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` He's never run a business. He's never started a business. He's never met a payroll. He does n't understand how when you're starting out, you need people to join you in taking risks. So he paints my proposal as an effort to help the rich.'' `` Wrong,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told his audience of 1,600 people. The vice president also said that since <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> took office in 1981, the administration has cut personal income tax rates by an average 27 percent. He said there has been an undeniable link between low taxes and economic growth. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was asked during the Democratic primary race if he would repeal the 1981 tax cuts. He said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> shrugged his shoulders and called the tax cut `` one of the worse bills that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> every could have passed'' and `` a government-made disaster.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` Those sound to me like the words of someone who is just itching to repeal one of the most successful economic policies in our history, and I know why. He has proposed mandated new spending, both by government and by business, that will cost ... billions and billions and billions.'' He said that if elected on Nov. 8, he will tell <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> that `` the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people, in electing me, voted against a tax increase'' and that instead, spending increases should be limited to the inflation rate. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told a <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> barbecue in <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, on Monday that the election was about keeping the country strong economically and militarily. `` We can not gamble <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s future on a president who has n't had one single day's experience in national defense matters or foreign affairs,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, winning cheers from the audience. A handful of hecklers shouted noisily at him during his speech, and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` I'm glad they're here.'' He urged the audience to ask the protesters how high interest rates and inflation were during the last Democratic administration, and then supplied the answers _ 21 percent for the former and in double digits for the latter. Working his way toward the battleground state of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, where he will campaign later this week, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> planned stops today at rallies at a stockyard in <LOCATION> Sioux </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Falls </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.D. </LOCATION>, and at a high school in Billings, <PERSON> Mont </PERSON>. In the evening, he was flying to <LOCATION> Tacoma </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION>, to campaign there Thursday morning. Whereas <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> offers the prospect of 20 electoral votes, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> has only three and <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> has only four. However, all three states are on <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' blueprint for reaching the 270 needed to win the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, so <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is doing his best to keep them out of the Democratic column. His campaign was bouyed Tuesday by news of two new polls indicating that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has solidified his lead in the two weeks since the last presidential debate. A <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News-New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> poll showed <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> with a 13-point advantage, 54-41 percent, while a Gallup poll showed <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> with a 14-point edge, 53-39 percent. With things going his way, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> stuck to a familiar theme Tuesday: hammering <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> about the economy during stops in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Canton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION>.

 Zambians voted Wednesday in elections expected to reaffirm support for the nation's founding father, whose popularity remains high despite severe economic problems. President <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaunda </PERSON>, who led the British colony to independence Oct. 24, 1964, needed 51 percent of ballots cast to serve another five years. Of <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION>'s 7 million people, 2.6 million are registered to vote. Also up for election were the 125 seats in the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>. Zambians had to decide from 609 candidates from the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Independence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. Voters chose between two symbols _ picking an eagle if they wanted to vote for <PERSON> Kaunda </PERSON>, or choosing a frog to vote against him. This is to accommodate illiterate voters. The last election was held in October 1983, when <PERSON> Kaunda </PERSON> won his fifth five-year term. Most observers believed that despite pressures for economic reforms, most voters would cast their ballot for <PERSON> Kaunda </PERSON>. `` I will go by what the people say,'' said <PERSON> Kaunda </PERSON>, 64, after casting his ballot. `` This is exactly what we fought for. It is the meaning of independence.'' He said the elections should inspire voteless people in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and in <LOCATION> South-West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, or <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>, which is ruled by <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. The congress of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Independence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> has routinely nominated <PERSON> Kaunda </PERSON> the sole candidate since independence, although it is free to choose more than one. New elections are held if the sole candidate loses. Analysts expected a low turnout for the sixth post-independence elections, but long lines had formed outside some polling stations in the capital, <LOCATION> Lusaka </LOCATION>, before voting began at 6 a.m. Rural Zambians went to the polls by bus, bicycle, tractor and on foot. In some areas, voters paddled canoes to the booths. In the <LOCATION> Mpika </LOCATION> district of <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> province, where roads are impassable because of heavy rains, voters were ferried by helicopters. But Zambian reporters in several rural areas said polling was slow and there were small lines outside most booths. When <PERSON> Kaunda </PERSON> led <LOCATION> Zambia </LOCATION> to independence, his people enjoyed one of the highest standards of living in <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, thanks largely to high world prices for copper which earns 90 percent of export income. But when prices slumped in the 1970s, a time when landlocked <LOCATION> Zambia </LOCATION> had transformed from food exporter to importer, the nation's fortunes changed The foreign debt mounted and today stands at $ 5 billion. Most foreign donors have stopped helping <LOCATION> Zambia </LOCATION> since <PERSON> Kaunda </PERSON> last year abandoned an economic recovery program proposed by the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monetary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION>.

 A <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> prosecutor on Wednesday urged West German Ambassador <PERSON> Jurgen </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhfus </PERSON> to help bring to justice a man who fled the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> while awaiting deportation as a suspected Nazi war criminal. <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION> <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Holtzman </PERSON> said she told the ambassador there was great concern in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> that <PERSON> Boleslav </PERSON> <PERSON> Maikovskis </PERSON> would `` slip through the cracks'' of the West German judicial system. <PERSON> Maikovskis </PERSON>, 83, left the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> last year after the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruled him eligible for deportation for his alleged involvement in Nazi atrocities during World War II, including the burning of a village in <LOCATION> Latvia </LOCATION> and the shooting of women and children. In 1965, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> sentenced <PERSON> Maikovskis </PERSON> to death in absentia. He could have been deported to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, in the wake of refusals in recent years by both <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> to take him, but former Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> refused to designate the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> as his destination. <PERSON> Holtzman </PERSON> said <PERSON> Ruhfus </PERSON> told her authorities in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> had only found out that <PERSON> Maikovskis </PERSON> was living there several weeks ago when the matter was first made public in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> media. The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> has also said it was unaware <PERSON> Maikovskis </PERSON> fled the country for <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, where he has sought political asylum. <PERSON> Holtzman </PERSON> said it was unclear to her whether local authorities in the town of <LOCATION> Dortmund </LOCATION> knew of <PERSON> Maikovskis </PERSON>' presence and his suspected <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> past until the matter became public. Authorities in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> earlier this month detained <PERSON> Maikovskis </PERSON> and launched an investigation of his past in connection with the murder charges leveled against him by the Soviets. <PERSON> Holtzman </PERSON> indicated she believed <PERSON> Maikovskis </PERSON> had received some assurances from West German authorities that he would be safe in their country. `` Otherwise why would he go to a country that has refused in the past to accept his deportation from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>?'' she said. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION> both refused to accept <PERSON> Maikovskis </PERSON> after the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> initially ordered him deported in 1984. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> refused to designate the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> as the country for <PERSON> Maikovskis </PERSON>' deportation even though the Soviets had expressed great interest in bringing him to trial. `` <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> violated the law by failing to act on the court's determination that <PERSON> Maikovskis </PERSON> should be deported from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Holtzman </PERSON> said The German ambassador promised to keep <PERSON> Holtzman </PERSON> informed of steps being taken against <PERSON> Maikovskis </PERSON> and to convey to the <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION> government `` the strong interest here that <PERSON> Maikovskis </PERSON> not go unpunished,'' <PERSON> Holtzman </PERSON> said.

 A British television program claimed three French gangsters assassinated President <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> on a contract from <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> organized crime, but French records show two of them were not in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> on Nov. 22, 1963. One of the three men, <PERSON> Sauveur </PERSON> <PERSON> Pironti </PERSON>, also denied the allegation in an interview published Wednesday by the <LOCATION> Marseilles </LOCATION> newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Le </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Provencal </ORGANIZATION>. It quoted him as saying `` I was not in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>, but in the military in <LOCATION> Toulon </LOCATION>,'' and said he displayed a military service record showing he was based on a mine sweeper in <LOCATION> Toulon </LOCATION> from Oct. 16, 1962, to April 16, 1964. `` I believe at that time my friend <PERSON> Sarti </PERSON> was being held in <LOCATION> Baumettes </LOCATION> -LRB- prison in <LOCATION> Marseilles </LOCATION> -RRB- and -LRB- <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> -RRB- <PERSON> Bocagnani </PERSON> was in prison at <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> du </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ha </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Bordeaux </LOCATION>,'' the newspaper quoted <PERSON> Pironti </PERSON> as saying. According to the two-hour <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> program `` The Men Who Killed <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>,'' broadcast Tuesday night, <PERSON> Lucien </PERSON> <PERSON> Sarti </PERSON> was was shot to death in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> in 1972 and <LOCATION> Bocagnani </LOCATION> is believed to be working in the Colombian cocaine trade. French <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> headquarters confirmed the dates of service in <LOCATION> Toulon </LOCATION> and said <PERSON> Pironti </PERSON>, 46, could not have been in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> on the day of the assassination. The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Bocagnani </PERSON> was in a jail cell in <LOCATION> Marseille </LOCATION> on that day. <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> was killed as he rode in a motorcade through <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> <PERSON> Oswald </PERSON> was charged with the shooting, but <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruby </PERSON> shot and killed him two days later. The <ORGANIZATION> Warren </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Oswald </PERSON> acted alone in the assassination. There have been many theories over the years that <PERSON> Oswald </PERSON> was not the killer or was part of a conspiracy in which assorted organizations, governments and personalities were involved. Central Television, a company in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s commercial <ORGANIZATION> Independent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> network </ORGANIZATION>, said its report was based on a four-year inquiry by <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Rivele </PERSON>, an American writer and researcher, and <PERSON> Nigel </PERSON> <PERSON> Turner </PERSON>, the documentary's British director. <PERSON> Rivele </PERSON> said the three men were hired through organized crime circles on the French Mediterranean island of <LOCATION> Corsica </LOCATION>, but the program produced no direct evidence of a Corsican connection. According to <PERSON> Rivele </PERSON>, he got on the Corsican trail by interviewing <PERSON> Christian </PERSON> <PERSON> David </PERSON>, a French drug smuggler held at the <LOCATION> Leavenworth </LOCATION> federal prison in <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>. In exchange for help in hiring an attorney, <PERSON> Rivele </PERSON> said, <PERSON> David </PERSON> told him he was offered the contract and refused it, then gradually revealed the identities of those involved. The <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> journalist said he persuaded a contact in the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, not identified, to give him someone who could corroborate <PERSON> David </PERSON>'s story. He identified that man as <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Nicoli </PERSON>, a government witness living under a false identity. <PERSON> Nicoli </PERSON>, interviewed with his face obscured, said he heard <PERSON> Sarti </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bocagnoni </PERSON> and <PERSON> Pironti </PERSON> were the killers in 1966, when he lived in <LOCATION> Buenos </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aires </LOCATION>. He said he believed it to be true but gave no indication that he had direct evidence of their involvement. <PERSON> David </PERSON>'s lawyer was interviewed and said the his client had given him a sealed envelope to be opened only if he was freed. <PERSON> Le </PERSON> <PERSON> Provencal </PERSON> said <PERSON> Pironti </PERSON>, a Corsican, has lived in <LOCATION> Marseilles </LOCATION> since his release four years ago after a prison term for drug smuggling. It quoted him as saying he spoke for <PERSON> Sarti </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bocagnani </PERSON>, `` and I can tell you that if they were in <LOCATION> Marseille </LOCATION> they would be with me here tonight. This business ... is the most incredible misadventure of my life.''

 Republican <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> today portrayed <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> as the odd man out in opposing a reduction in capital gains taxes, and said his <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> opponent is `` just itching to repeal'' income tax cuts enacted in President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s first term. Fortified by new polls showing him with a double-digit lead, the vice president attacked <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> at a luncheon sponsored by the <ORGANIZATION> Detroit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> and the Women's <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>. Playing it safe, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> stuck to time-tested themes. The <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> nominee has proposed slashing the capital gains tax on profits from stocks, real estate and other assets from its current top of 33 percent to 15 percent. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> denounced it as a tax break for the wealthy and said it would give <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> himself a $ 22,000 tax break annually. Defending his plan as a way to spur investments and create jobs, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` Over the years, it's been endorsed by everyone from <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> to <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> to my running mate, <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, to <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> is <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' vice presidential running mate. `` It is not a tax break for the rich. It is a break for those who want to have a job in this country and I am for it,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` Unfortunately, my opponent's only experience with business is regulating it and taxing it,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` He's never run a business. He's never started a business. He's never met a payroll. He does n't understand how when you're starting out, you need people to join you in taking risks. So he paints my proposal as an effort to help the rich.'' `` Wrong,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told his audience of 1,600 people. The vice president also said that since <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> took office in 1981, the administration has cut personal income tax rates by an average 27 percent. He said there has been an undeniable link between low taxes and economic growth. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was asked during the Democratic primary race if he would repeal the 1981 tax cuts. He said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> shrugged his shoulders and called the tax cut `` one of the worse bills that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> every could have passed'' and `` a government-made disaster.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` Those sound to me like the words of someone who is just itching to repeal one of the most successful economic policies in our history, and I know why. He has proposed mandated new spending, both by government and by business, that will cost ... billions and billions and billions.'' He said that if elected on Nov. 8, he will tell <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> that `` the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people, in electing me, voted against a tax increase'' and that instead, spending increases should be limited to the inflation rate. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told a <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> barbecue in <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, on Monday that the election was about keeping the country strong economically and militarily. `` We can not gamble <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s future on a president who has n't had one single day's experience in national defense matters or foreign affairs,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, winning cheers from the audience. A handful of hecklers shouted noisily at him during his speech, and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` I'm glad they're here.'' He urged the audience to ask the protesters how high interest rates and inflation were during the last Democratic administration, and then supplied the answers _ 21 percent for the former and in double digits for the latter. Working his way toward the battleground state of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, where he will campaign later this week, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> planned stops today at rallies at a stockyard in <LOCATION> Sioux </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Falls </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.D. </LOCATION>, and at a high school in Billings, <PERSON> Mont </PERSON>. In the evening, he was flying to <LOCATION> Tacoma </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION>, to campaign there Thursday morning. Whereas <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> offers the prospect of 20 electoral votes, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> has only three and <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> has only four. However, all three states are on <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' blueprint for reaching the 270 needed to win the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, so <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is doing his best to keep them out of the Democratic column. His campaign was bouyed Tuesday by news of two new polls indicating that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has solidified his lead in the two weeks since the last presidential debate. A <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News-New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> poll showed <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> with a 13-point advantage, 54-41 percent, while a Gallup poll showed <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> with a 14-point edge, 53-39 percent. With things going his way, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> stuck to a familiar theme Tuesday: hammering <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> about the economy during stops in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Canton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Doctors Change Advice on Deliveries</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Breaking with a 70-year-old tradition, the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Obstetricians </ORGANIZATION> and Gynecologists declared Wednesday that women who have had a baby by Caesarean section generally should deliver subsequent children by normal, vaginal birth. The new guidelines say such mothers should be encouraged by their doctors to choose normal delivery and that even those who have had two or more babies by C-section should receive support for attempting a vaginal delivery if that is their choice. The incidence of Caesarean delivery has skyrocketed over the past two decades, prompting many government and health leaders to pay closer attention to the risk and cost of such procedures balanced against natural delivery. In 1987, for example, 24.4 percent of the 3.8 million births recorded in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> were by Caesarean delivery _ compared with 5.5 percent of the 3.7 million births recorded in 1970. Of the 934,000 Caesarean deliveries in 1987, the College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists estimated that 35 percent were performed not because of a demonstrated medical need, but merely because the mother had previously delivered by Caesarean. `` This is the first time in over 70 years we are saying that a patient who has had a C-section should not have a repeat C-section unless there is a defiite medical need,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Jo </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Sullivan </PERSON>, a member of the panel that developed the new guidelines. She emphasized that the recommendation applies only to low-transverse, horizontal C-sections _ sometimes referred to by women as the bikini cut _ used 99 percent of the time. For those 1 percent of mothers who have had the classical vertical incision, the recommendation holds for using a C-section in subsequent deliveries to miminize the risk of a rupture of the uterus along the scar from the previous incision. If the new guidelines are embraced by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> hospitals, they will go far toward ending the `` once a C-section, always a C-section'' tradition that has guided obstetric practice since 1916, said <PERSON> O'Sullivan </PERSON>, who is chief of obstetrics and gynecology at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Miami </ORGANIZATION> medical school in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. She declined to offer a reason for the sharp rise in C-sections in recent years. But she acknowledged that some doctors may encourage them because they can charge more than for normal delivery, and also said `` many women do not want the pain of labor.'' According to government statistics, the average doctor and hospital charge in 1986 was $ 2,620 for a normal delivery and $ 4,330 for a C-section. In an interview, <PERSON> O'Sullivan </PERSON> said she hopes that a woman who has undergone C-sections and meets guideline criteria for trying a vaginal delivery in subsequent births will consider switching physicians if her present one is not sympathetic to her desires. On the other hand, she said she hoped that physicians who subscribe to the guidelines would counsel their patients to switch to another doctor if they are determined from the earliest weeks of pregnancy to have a C-section regardless of whether it is medically indicated. The shift of position outlined Wednesday stems from an accumulation of statistical data that has established that _ everything else being equal _ mother and baby generally fare better with vaginal delivery than a C-section even if the mother has previously had a low transverse C-section, <PERSON> O'Sullivan </PERSON> said. Not only are C-sections significantly more costly than natural delivery, they raise the prospect of the same type of potential complications attendant any major surgery, such as infections and reactions to anesthesia. The study found that women who have had a C-section by the low-transverse method were successful in subsequent vaginal delivery attempts in most cases. `` Up to 70 percent of these women who had their first Caesarean birth because of failure to progress in a long and difficult labor were able to deliver vaginally with their second child,'' Dr. <PERSON> O'Sullivan </PERSON> said. C-sections would continue to be used for such complications as breech births, when there are signs that the baby is in distress or following a difficult and prolonged attempt at labor.

<HEAD>Military Considering Civilians To Head `Stars &amp; Stripes' Newspapers</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, bracing for charges of censorship at the <ORGANIZATION> Stars </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Stripes military newspapers, is debating a significant shift in structure that would put civilian journalists at the top of the masthead instead of military officers. <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> officials say no final decision has been made to ditch the existing organizational system. But the officials say there appears to be fairly uniform agreement `` that something has to be done.'' `` We do n't want to fold these papers; there's nothing out there to replace them,'' explained one official, who spoke only on condition of anonymity. `` So you've got to consider ways to strengthen editorial control and dampen charges of censorship.'' The sources said Wednesday they expected a decision on the future of the newspapers to be made soon _ perhaps within the next week _ because the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> is facing a deadline for responding to a draft study of the newspapers by the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>. That report by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>' watchdog agency, while still in preliminary form, is described by officials who have read it as quite critical of the newspapers' operation. It finds `` overwhelming evidence'' of military censorship at one of the two papers, the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> edition of <ORGANIZATION> Stars </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Stripes, one source said. `` The best way to respond to the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> would be to tell them we're already changing things around,'' another source said The <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> investigation was launched early this year at the behest of Sen. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Proxmire </PERSON>, D-Wis., who persuaded <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to demand an inquiry into ` allegations of censorship by military commanders of the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> newspaper, Stars and Stripes. In demanding the investigation, <PERSON> Proxmire </PERSON> blasted the Pentagon for sending soldiers overseas to protect freedom while denying them `` one of the most important freedoms that we have in this country _ that is the right to a free press under the First Amendment.'' Although frequently referred to as one newspaper, the Stars and Stripes is published in two separate editions by largely autonomous bureaus in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. Designed to serve as the `` hometown paper'' for American military personnel posted overseas, the papers have a long history that dates to publication in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> during World War I. The papers are staffed by military as well as civilian journalists, but both papers are led by an officer who holds the title of commander and editor-in-chief. Those officers, in turn, must answer to the heads of the European and <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> commands. The <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> describes the papers as `` authorized, but unofficial publications.'' Both operate under a charter to provide `` a free flow of news and information ... without censorship or news management.'' In reality, however, reporters who have worked for the papers say they always walk a tightrope between reporting the news and satisfying military commanders worried about upsetting the host country. Examples of the problem are among those that prompted <PERSON> Proxmire </PERSON> to demand an investigation. There have been persistent reports the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> edition of Stars & amp; Stripes killed stories on the results of AIDS testing and the fact that some military wives were working in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> as bar hostesses. According to the sources, the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> reviewed those and other cases of alleged censorship, then asked an advisory panel from the <ORGANIZATION> Sigma </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chi </ORGANIZATION> professional journalism fraternity to help characterize the handling of each story as either typical news judgment or censorship. `` SDX did n't characterize all of the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> cases as censorship, and quite frankly that lends credibility to the report,'' one source said. `` But there is overwhelming evidence of censorship, overwhelming.''

<HEAD>Kahane Gets Court OK To Make U.S. Speaking Tour</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A federal judge ruled Wednesday that Brooklyn-born Rabbi <PERSON> Meir </PERSON> <PERSON> Kahane </PERSON> can travel here from <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> for a speaking tour while he challenges a government finding that he had renounced his <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizenship. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Barrington </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Parker </PERSON> ordered the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> not to interfere with <PERSON> Kahane </PERSON>'s plan to enter the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> early Thursday to begin a three-week speaking tour at a suburban <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> synagogue. <PERSON> Parker </PERSON> made the ruling at the conclusion of a 90-minute hearing during which an attorney for <PERSON> Kahane </PERSON> argued that the founder of the militant <ORGANIZATION> Jewish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> only renounced his <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizenship to retain his seat in the <ORGANIZATION> Knesset </ORGANIZATION>, the <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> parliament. Attorney <PERSON> Nathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewin </PERSON> maintained that <PERSON> Kahane </PERSON> only signed renunciation papers when faced with the `` <PERSON> Hobson </PERSON>'s choice'' of losing his seat in the <ORGANIZATION> Knesset </ORGANIZATION> or losing his American citizenship. <PERSON> Kahane </PERSON>, also an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> citizen, renounced his American citizenship to comply with a new Israeli law that prohibits <ORGANIZATION> Knesset </ORGANIZATION> members from being citizens of other nations. <PERSON> Kahane </PERSON> sent a telegram to withdraw the renunciation after the Israeli <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruled his anti-Arab political party was racist and therefore ineligible to partcipate in the Nov. 1 parliamentary election. The law requiring <PERSON> Kahane </PERSON> to renounce his <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizenship to keep his parliamentary seat was `` a figurative gun at his head,'' <PERSON> Lewin </PERSON> said. `` Did he cross his fingers when he signed the oath?'' the judge said. <PERSON> Lewin </PERSON> replied that <PERSON> Kahane </PERSON> issued a public statement explaining the reason for his renunciation and filed a written version with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Embassy officials when he signed the oath. Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> argued that <PERSON> Kahane </PERSON> `` knew exactly what he was doing. It was a voluntary choice.'' He cited several court cases in which Americans who had renounced their nationality to qualify for jobs in foreign countries were not allowed later to reclaim their citizenship. `` He has affirmatively gone in to renounce his citizenship. Not being a citizen anymore, he has no right to come into this country on a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> passport,'' <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> said. `` He knew what the consequences of his choice were _ therefore it was voluntary.'' <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> noted that because <PERSON> Kahane </PERSON> had signed the incorrect form on Aug. 16 he returned to the <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION> embassy in September and `` for a second time renounced his citizenship by filling out the correct papers.'' <PERSON> Lewin </PERSON> said <PERSON> Kahane </PERSON> should not be stripped of his citizenship rights until the court rules on whether his renunciation was valid. `` They do n't have a constitutional right to take something away from him as precious as citizenship without an adversary hearing,'' <PERSON> Lewin </PERSON> said. He accused the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> of trying to muzzle <PERSON> Kahane </PERSON>, whose extremist views have been the focus of controversy both here and in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. `` Because <PERSON> Meir </PERSON> <PERSON> Kahane </PERSON> is a notorious figure and people know about him, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> is taking a strong line,'' <PERSON> Lewin </PERSON> said. `` They do n't want him here.'' `` Whether they agreed or disagree with him, this is a country where he has a right to come and speak,'' <PERSON> Lewin </PERSON> said. Four years ago, a federal judge rejected the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s claim that <PERSON> Kahane </PERSON> had renounced his citizenship by taking a seat in the <ORGANIZATION> Knesset </ORGANIZATION>

The Republican vice presidential nominee touted the prospects for a rosy future at a space and missile contractor's plant in <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, before a heavily Cuban audience at <ORGANIZATION> Miami </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> and at an outdoor rally in the `` Little Havana'' section of <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> was cheered loudly at the high school, especially when he mentioned the school's band and basketball and football teams, in a rambling speech about education, drugs and the future. The students buzzed when the 41-year-old <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> senator said prenatal care and adoption should be options if a teen-age girl becomes pregnant. He said he and GOP presidential candidate <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> were committed to good jobs and education. `` A job is opportunity. A job is hope. A job is a chance of being able to go out and produce for yourself and your family,'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said. `` And that future, which is your future, and I want you to join with me and <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in working for that future _ that future where people are looking up, that future where people are smiling, that future where people are working, that future where people are producing ... `` What you do in this city in this state at this time,'' he said, `` that future, because of your work, because of your commitment to the cause, will be better, will be brighter. We'll let the sunshine come in to shine on us because today we're happy and tomorrow we'll be even happier. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> later modified his usual stump speech with one-liners intended to appeal to the anti-communist sentiments of his audience outside the Little Havana Activities and Nutrition Centers of <LOCATION> Dade </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>. He promised that he and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> `` will invest in our people, quality education, job opportunities, family, neighborhood and, yes, a thing we call <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. A thing we call <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> because this country is still the beacon of hope for millions around the world.'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> began the day at a fund-raising breakfast in <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION> for Republican Rep. <PERSON> Connie </PERSON> <PERSON> Mack </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, who is locked in a close battle against Rep. <PERSON> Buddy </PERSON> <PERSON> MacKay </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Fla </LOCATION>., for the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> seatbeing vacated by <PERSON> Lawton </PERSON> <PERSON> Chiles </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, a Democrat `` I know that <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> is going to vote for <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on Nov. 8,'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said. But he said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had asked him to deliver the message that he wants <PERSON> Mack </PERSON> as `` a partner in the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Senate.'' <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> officials said <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> will be making more such appearances on behalf of <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> candidates in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>. Reporters asked <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> about a new <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News_New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> poll showing that he is the least popular among the four candidates on the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> and Democratic tickets this fall. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> replied that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is `` the person that is unpopular in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> ... he's dragging his ticket down.'' As for whether his presence on the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> ticket might be hurting <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, the senator said, `` As a matter of fact when we got on this ticket, we were double digits behind, and we're doing quite well.''

<HEAD>Soviet Shuttle to Blast off Saturday on Unmanned Mission</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> said Wednesday it will launch its space shuttle Buran on an unmanned mission this week, following months of delays similar to those that plagued the maiden voyage of its <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> counterpart. A government commission set the launch for 6:23 a.m. <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> time Saturday -LRB- 11:23 p.m. EDT Friday -RRB- after receiving reports from specialists following several thousand tests of the Buran and its booster rocket, the <ORGANIZATION> Energia </ORGANIZATION>, the official news agency <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> reported. `` Buran'' is Russian for snowstorm, an appropriate name since the first snow of the season fell this week in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. Preparations for pouring nearly 2,000 tons of liquid hydrogen, oxygen and hydrocarbon fuel into <LOCATION> Energia </LOCATION>, billed as the world's most powerful booster rocket, are to begin Thursday, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. The rocket is capable of carrying more than 100 tons of cargo into Earth orbit, and up to 20 tons to the planets Mars and <PERSON> Venus </PERSON>. State-run television on Wednesday showed the white delta-shaped Buran, with its name emblazoned in red, attached to the Energia on a launch pad at the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s Baikonur Cosmodrome on the Central Asian steppes of the republic of <LOCATION> Kazakhstan </LOCATION>. Launch was originally planned for the first half of this year, but was postponed as technical problems arose, officials said. A Soviet TV announcer indicated Wednesday the launch time could be pushed back because tests of systems may take longer than anticipated. `` The 29th of October is a day when confidence, hopes and fears will be confirmed or refuted,'' the announcer said. The maiden flight of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> shuttle <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> in 1981 was postponed many times because of technical snags. Soviet officials have said the first flight would be pilotless to prevent accidents like the Jan. 28, 1986, explosion of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> shuttle Challenger. Seven astronauts were killed in that blast. Soviet media did not say how long Buran's mission would last. If the test flight is successful, a mission with two cosmonauts is to follow, but Soviet officials have not said when. On Sept. 29, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said the first mission was planned `` to conduct a comprehensive flight test of the spaceship's design and its on-board systems without a crew on board during liftoff, in orbit and during automatic landing as well as to continue upgrading the booster rocket and ground flight control aids.'' The Soviet shuttle program has been shrouded in secrecy since it began in 1982, and <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> officials said Wednesday foreign reporters would not be allowed to travel to Baikonur for the launch. What little information the Soviets have given about the shuttle has appeared timed for political purposes, to highlight the capabilities of their manned space program as measured against the American counterpart. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> transmitted the first pictures of the Soviet shuttle on Sept. 29, at about the same time the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> shuttle Discovery was launched from <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canaveral </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla </LOCATION>. The Discovery mission marked a return of the American manned space program after a 2 -LCB- - year suspension caused by the Challenger accident The Soviets may also use the test flight to highlight what they claim is the peaceful nature of their space program. The next <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> shuttle, the Atlantis, will be launched in November and is to carry a military payload.

 <PERSON> Christa </PERSON> <PERSON> McAuliffe </PERSON>'s husband and parents Wednesday helped break ground for a pyramid-shaped planetarium honoring the teacher killed along with six other astronauts aboard the space shuttle Challenger. `` She was the most humble of persons. She would be embarrassed to have her name on a building,'' said <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> McAuliffe </PERSON>, who said his wife believed she was representing all teachers in the space program. About 1,000 people gathered on frost-covered grass at the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hampshire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>: teachers and school officials from <LOCATION> Concord </LOCATION> as well as children and other residents caught up in the excitement that led to Challenger's flight and the grief that followed its destruction on Jan. 28, 1986. The $ 2.6 million planetarium is expected to be dedicated in January 1990. During the day the glass exterior will reflect the clouds _ at night the <LOCATION> moon </LOCATION> and stars. The key feature will be a computer projection system that simulates space travel and shows the sky's changes over 2 million years. Visitors under the 40-foot dome will experience the sights of moving through space or view the night sky as if they were part of a lunar expedition and watch the <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> rise. The project was selected from about 100 suggestions for a state memorial, a choice <PERSON> McAuliffe </PERSON> praised. `` I ca n't imagine a more appropriate, a more fitting memorial,'' he said. Her parents, <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> and <PERSON> Grace </PERSON> <PERSON> Corrigan </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Framingham </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, wielded shovels in a line of dignitaries. `` She would be very pleased that something like this is ongoing and such a positive thing for education,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Corrigan </PERSON> said. `` I just wish she were here with us.''

<HEAD>Supreme Soviet Faces Budget Issue Thursday</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANN IMSE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The Soviet parliament will confront a dilemma when it convenes Thursday: the need to slash an enormous budget deficit while soothing public anger over empty store shelves. The 1,500 deputies of the Supreme Soviet typically sit through hours of numbing speeches in their two-day autumn session before unanimously approving the annual budget and development plan. This time, with the example of June's vociferous <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> conference telling them glasnost has ripped the economic veil, Western diplomats predict the deputies may actually offer some candid comments on the <ORGANIZATION> Kremlin </ORGANIZATION>'s economic plan. They also might comment on <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s proposal for multiple-candidate elections to a new <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deputies </ORGANIZATION>, although the reform laws published last weekend are scheduled for consideration at a separate Supreme Soviet meeting in November. Thursday's session will be the first to deal openly with what the government acknowledges is a serious budget deficit. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION>, the official news agency, says that problem `` was passed over in silence previously.'' Some analysts say that deficit could be as high as $ 100 billion due to a combination of problems ranging from the cleanup of the <LOCATION> Chernobyl </LOCATION> nuclear disaster to lost revenues from curtailed vodka sales. Simultaneously, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> is trying to fill its chronically empty food shelves and stop the periodic disappearance of everyday necessities. Among items unavailable in most <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> stores are laundry detergent, razor blades and deodorant. The leadership already has made one hard decision: investment in heavy industry will be sharply cut back in 1989 in order to finance purchase of more consumer goods. When President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> visited the Siberian city of <LOCATION> Krasnayarsk </LOCATION> last month, he was besieged by angry citizens complaining of shortages. For the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, where heavy industry has been the favored child for decades, and where <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> once seriously argued that chronic shortages of consumer goods fueled economic growth, this is a radical turnabout. The <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> report says the 1989 plan calls for 6 percent growth in consumer goods versus 2.5 percent in heavy industry. Western economists point out that the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> may never achieve these goals, but the comparative projections imply a dramatic shift in underlying investment. For example, a recently completed tractor factory is being converted to passenger car production. Still, the tasks are daunting. To fulfill <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s promise that every family will have its own apartment by the year 2000, he needs a crash construction program in an industry legendary for endless delays and careless workmanship. Even those with sufficient space may find themselves in the 10 percent of <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s housing that lacks hot water and central heat in a city where the temperature drops below freezing six months out of the year. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s best hope for solving the shortages is found in the incredible waste now blamed on central planning. For example, at a recent agricultural conference, a farmer complained to <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> that he was left without fuel at harvest time because too much oil has been sold for hard currency to buy grain. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> himself said more than 25 percent of the nation's harvest is lost by rotting en route to the stores For cutting the budget, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> appears to be relying on his plan to shift to more productive work as much as half of the bloated bureaucracy, a mass that numbers somewhere between 18 million and 30 million people. He also is counting on modern _ and largely Western _ technology to increase productivity in manufacturing. In the first nine months of this year, 1 million factory jobs were eliminated, a statistic announced with pride in a nation that once pointed to layoffs as being among the horrors of capitalism. The government statistician who revealed that figure said one-third of those workers retired and the other two-thirds found positions in service industries or the new private cooperatives. The looming question in solving the deficit, however, is the same one facing the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>: Will the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> cut its defense budget? The West, not to mention the Soviet public, may never know. Soviet military expenditures are scattered throughout the national budget, and the official line item is a fraction of the true total, estimated by the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> at about 15 percent of the total Soviet economy. All these challenges are coming at a time of radicial change in the structure of the Soviet economy. For example, the development plan before the legislature calls for most new machinery, textiles, ceramics and shoes to be sold on an open market for the first time in more than half a century. The ministries for machine-building and light industry, which traditionally set quotas for those goods, would control only a fraction of production. Western diplomats, speaking on the condition they not be identified, said such issues could produce fireworks at the usually staid Supreme Soviet. In the four weeks since he slammed through a reorganization of the ruling Politburo and <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and his allies have hinted they intend to press for even more radical change. A return to family farming, conversion of even major industry to private cooperatives and making the ruble convertible on international currency markets are among the proposals being discussed.

 Democratic presidential nominee <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaigned among Hispanic voters Wednesday, shrugged off discouraging new polls and accused Republicans of uttering `` a lot of baloney'' about gun controls. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> met with Hispanic leaders in <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> the morning after a 90-minute appearance on <ORGANIZATION> ABC-TV </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Nightline'' program, then flew to <LOCATION> Pueblo </LOCATION> in southern <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> for a large outdoor rally. `` The pollsters are not going to call this election,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. `` It's people that are going to be voting. We have 13 important days ahead of us.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> again accused Republican rival <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and his allies of producing `` noise pollution'' and distorting the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor's record on such issues as gun controls. `` They're afraid if the smog clears from all the noise pollution that they have been laying down, that people will realize that they do n't understand average American families,'' the Democratic nominee said. `` Yes, it has been a campaign of distortion and misrepresentation,'' he said. `` The latest one is gun control.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has found himself on the defensive about gun controls during nearly ever visit to the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION>, where the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rifle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> has been broadcasting commercials charging that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> would disarm gun owners. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> says he does not oppose gun ownership by hunters, sportsmen and homeowners protecting their lives and property, but he wants to deny them to criminals. `` I hope you'll take that word back to your friends and neighbors. These charges are a lot of baloney, and I hope you'll tell them that,'' he told about 4,000 people outside the <LOCATION> Pueblo </LOCATION> courthouse as he stood next to a large hot-air balloon `` <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> said, here in <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> in 1960, ` No attacks, no attempt to discredit me, no attempt to discredit us will keep us from speaking up for a stronger <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>','' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said, evoking the name of the late president who defeated <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> in that election. For the second straight day, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was greerted by dismal polls published by leading newspapers. A <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News-New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> poll placed him 13 percentage points behind <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, a further decline in his standing since their Oct. 13 debate in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. Gallup polls showed <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> trailing by 14 points among likely voters. An earlier <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> poll put him nine points down in must-win <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> took no questions from reporters Wednesday, but referred to the latest bad news polls during his breakfast meeting with Hispanic members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and community leaders in <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>. `` I'm inspired and encouraged as I always am when I meet with you,'' he told them. `` We go forth now from <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Pueblo </LOCATION> and on across this country to work, to campaign and to win. And we're going to win.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> aides sought to put the best face possible on the poll results. They said the CBS-Times poll did not match their own findings, but some advisers privately did not dispute the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> poll. In addition, a <ORGANIZATION> Denver </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> poll showed him trailing by double digits in <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Charlie </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' national field director, said internal campaign polling showed voters `` trending toward us in the last few days.'' He gave no specifics, but said the national contest `` is very close.'' In the past week, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has devoted much of his time to attacking what he calls lies and distortions by the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign and the vice president's criticism of his record on defense, crime and other issues. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said that approach was working, the poll results notwithstanding. `` It's clear this campaign of lies and distortions is catching up with these guys,'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said. `` Our tracking polls showed for the first time when you ask who is responsible for the negative campaign, they say <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> received warmly enthusiastic expressions of support from the Hispanic leaders. Rep. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Bustamante </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, praised <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> using the words `` liberal'' and `` technocrat,'' which sometimes are attached to the Democratic nominee in derision. He said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> does n't smile a lot and is n't a backslapper like most politicians. `` He's a technocrat. He understands management,'' <PERSON> Bustamante </PERSON> said. `` As far as being a liberal in 1988, if liberalism means we care about children, and we are about the elderly, and we care about the environment, and we care about family farms ... then I am for <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, the liberal of 1988.'' <PERSON> Bustamante </PERSON> said that if there is a heavy voter turnout among Hispanics on Nov. 8 _ 70 percent or more _ they could swing a close election in <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' favor. Gov. <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Romer </PERSON> said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> faces an uphill battle in <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>. `` It's a pretty big hill,'' he said.

<HEAD>Drug-Related Turf Battles Push Washington Toward Homicide Record</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Increasingly violent turf battles involving drug dealers have pushed the nation's capital to the brink of a homicide record this year, the city's police chief said Wednesday. With less than three months remaining in 1988, 285 people have been killed in the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>, two deaths short of the record for one year set in 1969. There were 227 homicides in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> last year. `` We do n't have organized crime in this city, so we have a lot of young entrepreneurs fighting for turf,'' Police Chief <PERSON> Maurice </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> said. `` There is just more and more fighting over where the drugs are to be sold,'' <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> told a news conference at police headquarters. Police estimate that 60 percent of this year's killings have been drug-related, compared with 1986 when 33 percent of the homicides involved drugs. The demand for crack, a highly addictive cocaine derivative, has fueled the accelerating homicide rate, <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> said. `` This is one of the last major cities in this country to have an infusion of crack,'' <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> said. `` When crack arrived in other cities, like <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, murder rates went up there too.'' <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> called for increased federal efforts to stem the flow of drugs into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` The federal government must increase its commitment to interdict drugs at our borders and port cities,'' <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> said. `` Unless we intensify our efforts there, the drug problem will continue to flourish.'' More than 45,000 people have been arrested since the district initiated a tough anti-drug program in 1986, but <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> said that for each drug dealer arrested, another is ready to step forward to take his place. `` People are willing to take the risk of going to jail in order to make large sums of money,'' <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> said. `` You can make a million dollars a year selling drugs. They do n't have skills. Most of them are high-school dropouts. What would you do?'' Although the city's police force has been cut from 5,100 in 1977 to its current level of 3,800, <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> said more police officers would not necessarily stem the drug trade. Instead, he said, having more officers on the streets would simply produce more arrests _ and more crowding in the city's overcrowded jails. Turner called on parents and teachers in the nation's capital to help educate their children about the perils of drug use. He said casual drug users, as well as drug dealers, are both part of the problem. Speeding addicts through drug treatment programs also will help reduce the city's appetite for narcotics, <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> said. Drug addicts must now wait an average of three weeks or longer to enter city-funded drug treatment programs.

 Seven Lebanese newspapers published a letter to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> hostage <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> Wednesday on the eve of his 41st birthday _ his fourth in captivity _ from a committee of journalists working for his release. <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, chief <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> correspondent for <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, is the longest-held of the 14 foreign hostages held in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. He was kidnapped March 16, 1985, by a pro-Iranian Shiite Moslem faction calling itself Islamic Jihad, or Holy War. `` Your colleagues in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and throughout the world salute you today on your birthday,'' said the letter published Wednesday in the newspapers. <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>'s birthday actually is Thursday. The <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Voice </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Moslem </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Voice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nation </ORGANIZATION> radio stations broadcast the statement in Arabic against a background of somber music. The stations also announced that they will broadcast the statement in English on Thursday in the hope that <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, who does not speak Arabic, would be able to hear it. The papers also published a photograph of American country music star <PERSON> Hank </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> receiving a bracelet from <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>'s sister, <PERSON> Peggy </PERSON> <PERSON> Say </PERSON>. The bracelet includes the captive's name and the date of his abduction. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> signed a birthday card for <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> as did other stars before the Country Music Association awards show began in <LOCATION> Nashville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>. Oct. 10 The papers that published the letter to <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> included <PERSON> Al-Haqiqa </PERSON>, the daily publication of the mainstream <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Amal </ORGANIZATION> militia. Amal is locked in a bitter power struggle with pro-Iranian Shiite zealots believed holding the foreigners' hostage. The letter to <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> said: `` Those of us on the <ORGANIZATION> Journalists </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> to Free <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, as well as thousands of others throughout our profession, pay tribute to you for honoring throughout your career the highest standards of journalism `` We respect your commitment to truth and fairness in your coverage of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, your partisanship towards none, your respect towards all,'' the letter said. `` Yet we also honor you today as a man of dignity and courage in the dark places of privation. All free men and women who live by the pen share this morning in your captivity. `` As you mark your 41st birthday, your fourth in incarceration, we join our hearts with yours in yearning for your freedom. We greet you, we salute you and we encourage you,'' the letter said. In addition to <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, the 13 foreigners missing in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> are eight Americans, three Britons, an Italian and an Irishman. The group has demanded the release of 17 comrades jailed in <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> for the 1983 bombing of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and French embassies. <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> has refused to release the convicted terrorists.

 Islamic extremists claimed responsibility Wednesday for the killing of a <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabian </LOCATION> diplomat, and the <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> ambassador said his embassy had received more than 100 threatening letters before the attack. Police speculated a sole gunman shot <PERSON> Abdulgani </PERSON> <PERSON> Bedawi </PERSON> as the <ORGANIZATION> Saudi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arabian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> employee returned to his <LOCATION> Ankara </LOCATION> apartment Tuesday night, said <LOCATION> Ankara </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Saffet </PERSON> <PERSON> Arikan </PERSON> <PERSON> Beduk </PERSON>. In <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, an extremist group calling itself <LOCATION> Islamic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jihad </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Hijaz </LOCATION> said it killed <PERSON> Bedawi </PERSON> to avenge the execution of four of its followers. The claim came in a typewritten Arabic statement from the pro-Iranian <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> group, whose previous statements detailed underground activity against the Saudi monarchy. The statement was delivered to a Western news agency in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. There was no immediate response to the Islamic group's claim in <LOCATION> Ankara </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> ambassador, <PERSON> Abdulaziz </PERSON> <PERSON> Khojah </PERSON>, said <PERSON> Bedawi </PERSON> had been the embassy's telex operator for the last six years and held diplomatic status. <PERSON> Khojah </PERSON> said he ruled out robbery or personal conflict in the killing. He added that the embassy had received more than 100 threatening letters written in Turkish during the Moslem pilgrimage season this summer. Without elaborating, the ambassador said: `` I do n't believe the Turks have anything to do with the incident even though the letters were in Turkish.'' <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> restricted the number of Moslems who could visit the country during the pilgrimage season this year according to each Moslem nation's population. The decision came after a riot by Iranians during the 1987 pilgrimage to Mecca that killed more than 400 Iranians. <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> broke diplomatic ties with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> in April, listing as reasons the clash in <LOCATION> Mecca </LOCATION> and an attack on the Saudi Embassy in <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>. A Turkish official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the Saudi officials had not requested extra protection for embassy personnel. <PERSON> Beduk </PERSON> said police had no clues on the identity of the assailant but believed a sole gunman killed <PERSON> Bedawi </PERSON>. He did not elaborate. Neighbors reported hearing no gunshots, raising the possibility a silencer was used.

<TEXT>
 The top counterterrorism official in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government said Wednesday he was concerned that <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> might give chemical weapons to terrorists. Ambassador <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Bremer </PERSON> said that while there is no evidence that <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> intends to arm terrorists with chemical weapons, there are reasons to fear it might. <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> Director <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Webster </PERSON> said Tuesday that <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>'s chemical weapons plant was the largest detected by his agency anywhere in the world. <PERSON> Webster </PERSON> refused to say whether the facility was operational, but other officials have said <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> is on the verge of production. `` They have no record of restraint,'' <PERSON> Bremer </PERSON> said in an interview Wednesday. `` We're concerned, and we think others should be too.'' <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>, which appeared to suspend its support for terrorist groups following the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aerial bombing of <LOCATION> Tripoli </LOCATION> in April 1986, has resumed its involvement in international terrorism over the past year, <PERSON> Bremer </PERSON> said. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has accused <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> of sponsoring attacks against <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> offices in <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>, as well as a club frequented by American servicemen in <LOCATION> Naples </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>. Five people were killed in the <LOCATION> Naples </LOCATION> attack earlier this year. Specifically, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials accuse <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> of backing the Palestinian <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Nidal </PERSON> group, the <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Japanese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Bremer </PERSON> said `` <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> has a track record of providing lethal weapons to terrorists.'' He said <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> provided the weapons for the <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Nidal </PERSON> attacks in December 1985 at the <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> airports, as well as the Palestinian faction's attack on the City of <LOCATION> Poros </LOCATION> cruise liner off the Greek coast last July. <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> also sent Soviet-made SA-7 anti-aircraft missiles and <ORGANIZATION> Semtech </ORGANIZATION> explosives to the <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Bremer </PERSON> said. One shipload of these weapons was intercepted off the French coast last November.

<HEAD>Company to Suspend Distribution of Abortion Pill</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A company will stop distributing a pill to induce abortions because of `` an outcry of opinion at home and abroad,'' officials said Wednesday. Some company sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said it received threats of a boycott against their products, especially from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The move was hailed by Archbishop <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Decourtray </PERSON>, head of <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>'s conference of <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> bishops. `` I hope that this withdrawal is due to moral considerations and not to other reasons stemming from passion or violence,'' he said in <LOCATION> Lourdes </LOCATION>, where the conference is meeting. In a speech to the conference, <PERSON> Decourtray </PERSON> said the drug represented a `` serious threat, a new step in the everyday acceptance of abortion.'' Opponents of abortion used authorization of the drug to resurrect the philosophical battle and repeat their long-standing positions. The pharmaceutical company, <PERSON> Roussel </PERSON> <PERSON> Uclaf </PERSON>, said the decision to stop worldwide distribution of the highly effective pill, known as RU 486, came in response to the `` outcry of public opinion at home and abroad'' against the drug. The pill is an anti-hormone that works against the female hormone progesterone, which is vital to a normal pregnancy. The new drug blocks implantation of the fertilized egg in the uterine wall. RU 486 is about 80 percent effective when used alone. With a second product called sulprotone, or prostaglandine E, it is more than 95 percent effective. The new drug is not a do-it-yourself, morning-after pill that can be purchased at the supermarket and taken at home. It must be used under supervision of medical specialists in a hospital. On Sept. 23, French Health Minister <PERSON> Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Evin </PERSON> authorized prescription of the drug subject to strict conditions. It was delivered on an experimental basis to about 100 hospitals where abortions are performed. The government decision gave <PERSON> Roussel </PERSON> <PERSON> Uclaf </PERSON>, which invested much money in developing the drug, the green light to put it on the market. The product already had been approved by the Chinese government. Officials at <PERSON> Roussel </PERSON>, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the company had received threats of boycott against all its products, `` especially from abroad and especially from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.'' Abortion has been legal in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, a predominantly <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> country, since 1975. <PERSON> Evin </PERSON> said that authorization of RU 486 in no way changed existing <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> law on abortions and that they still would be carried out under strict legal conditions. Dr. <PERSON> Arlette </PERSON> <PERSON> Geslin </PERSON>, <PERSON> Roussel </PERSON>'s director of medical relations, said company officials were not suspending distribution of the drug because of any harmful side effects found in testing. `` That is not the case,'' she said. `` And if it had been, we would have said it was the factor that motivated our decision.'' <PERSON> Roussel </PERSON> <PERSON> Uclaf </PERSON> is part of the giant West German chemical group <ORGANIZATION> Hoescht </ORGANIZATION>, which has the majority share. The French government has a 36 percent share.

<HEAD>Oxford Launches American-style Appeal for Funds</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OXFORD, England (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Oxford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> launched a U.S.-style, worldwide appeal Wednesday for more than $ 380 million to help overcome a funding crunch that school officials blame mostly on government cutbacks. `` Oxford was built on private philanthropy until about 1920, then forgot how to do it,'' said <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Drucker </PERSON>, director of the campaign. `` So we have to go back to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and, in a sense, learn what we taught them in the first place.'' The ancient school, which already has gained pledges of $ 90 million in its $ 387 million drive, will ask alumni and companies to help bolster its $ 10 million endowment, refill the nearly 10 percent of its faculty posts left vacant, and support other projects. `` We aim to be a trailblazer and change the climate of opinion where corporations realize they should be supporting universities -LRB- as they do -RRB- in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' said Vice Chancellor Sir <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Neill </PERSON>. About 35 students mounted a protest against the campaign, saying <LOCATION> Oxford </LOCATION> should have pressured the government harder before asking for private support, said university spokeswoman <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> <PERSON> Lonsdale </PERSON>. About 25 other students demonstrated nearby in support of the appeal. The five-year drive will include not only fundraising letters but also the university's first alumni magazine, `` Oxford Today,'' which was mailed Wednesday. The campaign will have an office in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and possibly <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>. The university, which received its first charter in 1213, has left 122 of its 1,420 faculty posts vacant as part of a retrenchment program brought on by an 11 percent cut in government funding for 1986-1991.

<TEXT>
 Radical students attacked <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> government buildings Wednesday during a string of protests that broke out nearly simultaneously in a provincial city, police said. Police said one student was seriously injured during the unrest in President <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> <PERSON> Tae-woo </PERSON>'s hometown of <LOCATION> Taegu </LOCATION>, 170 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>. About 300 students were involved in the four attacks in <LOCATION> Taegu </LOCATION>, which occurred in a span of one hour, police said. Also Wednesday, about 250 students staged a brief street demonstration in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>, burning two cars with firebombs before riot police squads arrived. In <LOCATION> Taegu </LOCATION>, the nation's third largest city, bands of students identifying themselves as members of the `` save-the-nation suicide squad'' attacked the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> cultural center and three <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> government buildings, police said. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> said about 100 students hurled stones and firebombs, and chased off guards. Firebombs thrown by students did not explode, but assailants destroyed windows and fled with the center's sign when police arrived and fired tear gas, the embassy said. There were no injuries and arrests in the brief attack, but three cars parked inside the center were slightly damaged, the embassy said. Almost simultaneously, bands of students with firebombs and clubs attacked a police station, a government party building and a government prosecutor's office in the city's center, police said. In one attack, 10 students seized control of a prosecutor's office for 2 -LCB- hours before police moved in with water cannons and tear gas, they said The students, wearing anti-government headbands, hung a South Korean national flag and a placard demanding the arrest of former President <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> <PERSON> Doo-hwan </PERSON> for alleged corruption and other irregularities involving his seven years in office. <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> left office in February after national elections. During the police operation, <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Chang-hwan </PERSON>, a 21-year-old senior at <ORGANIZATION> Kyungbuk </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in the city, seriously injured his back when he jumped off a fourth-floor window onto a safety net, which fell apart on impact. Students hurling rocks and firebombs also attacked a government party building and a police station in the general area, destroying windows and two cars parked nearby, police said. The attack on the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> cultural center in <LOCATION> Taegu </LOCATION> was the third against <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> facilities in two weeks.

<HEAD>Dukakis' Late Television Blitz Seen As Last Resort</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JILL LAWRENCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Democratic underdog <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is all over the airwaves in an unprecedented blitz of television interviews that analysts say ca n't hurt him but probably wo n't sway enough voters to win him the presidency. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is snapping up television invitations with record speed while Republican <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, with double-digit leads in most polls, weighs when and where and whether to appear. `` He has everything to gain because he has nothing to lose,'' <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Buckley </PERSON>, a Republican consultant and <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> commentator, said of the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> strategy. `` He's behind in every poll. He's behind in more than 40 states. His only hope is to get as much exposure for himself as possible and hope that what he says has some resonance with voters.'' `` He's in a box. He's got to go on TV,'' said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Georgetown </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> government professor and a director of the Times-Mirror-Gallup voter surveys. `` But without any real news to go with the media saturation, no one can possibly expect that the election would turn around.'' The <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor has no shortage of money for television advertising. But his campaign has decided that voters, in addition to 30-second doses of their candidate and his message, also need lengthier exposures such as <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' 90-minute interview with <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Koppel </PERSON> Tuesday night on <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Nightline.'' `` This a chance to have people see the real <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>,'' spokesman <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Gearan </PERSON> said Wednesday. `` What we've seen over the last 20 months is that the more you see him, the more you like him.'' The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> camp, which tried to neutralize the `` Nightline'' appearance in some parts of the country with repeated airings during commercial breaks of an ad accusing <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> of opposing `` virtually every defense system we developed,'' predictably takes the opposite view. `` The more you see and hear him, the less enchanted you are with him,'' said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s ad director, <PERSON> Sig </PERSON> <PERSON> Rogich </PERSON>, who has studied tapes of <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> in every primary season debate. The success of the saturation strategy hinges on which way <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> comes across to undecided Americans _ and whether any of them are still willing to listen. Only about a quarter of probable voters are undecided at this stage of the game, according to a new <ORGANIZATION> CBS-New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> poll. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> aides put out the word Wednesday that the candidate's `` Nightline'' appearance was `` a terrific session'' for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> `` The people who watch ` Nightline' are serious people who wanted to know what this man believes in. ... He did exactly what he thought he had to do,'' said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> adviser <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Engelberg </PERSON>. But <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> passed up numerous chances during the interview to stress his new populist image as a fighter for `` Main Street'' Americans, a president who would be `` on your side.'' He also failed to dispute a <PERSON> Koppel </PERSON> suggestion that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has nailed `` your hide to the wall.'' <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Sabato </PERSON>, a political scientist at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Virginia </ORGANIZATION>, called the show `` the dullest interview I've ever seen <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Koppel </PERSON> conduct. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' answers just were n't that lively or interesting. And he missed so many opportunities to make useful points from his perspective. Something to warm him up, something to make him appear more human.'' <PERSON> Sabato </PERSON> said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> appeared to loosen up in the last few minutes of the 90-minute interview. `` By then 90 percent of the audience had fallen asleep or gone to bed. The most important minutes were the first 10.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> will have a least a few more chances to improve his performance. He's scheduled for 14 minutes Thursday night with <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Rather </PERSON> on <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>, an appearance next week with <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Brokaw </PERSON> on <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> and an interview with <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Frost </PERSON> Nov. 6 on the <ORGANIZATION> Fox </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> network. He's already appeared on the morning news shows and the <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> talk show on <ORGANIZATION> CNN </ORGANIZATION>. His wife, <PERSON> Kitty </PERSON>, was on <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>' `` Face the Nation.'' His running mate, Sen. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, was on <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` This Week with <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Brinkley </PERSON>'' and was scheduled for a Rather interview Wednesday night. `` It's probably true what the Republicans believe, that the more you see this guy, the less excited you're going to be about him,'' said <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>. `` I ca n't imagine he's going to push people into his column by force of personality. But he ca n't hide now, he's got to come out. He's got to be <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. And he will go down in an honorable defeat.'' Regardless of <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' fate, <PERSON> Sabato </PERSON> said, the media `` should be congratulated'' for giving him so much exposure. `` They're saying no longer will we let one candidate -LRB- refusing to appear -RRB- be an insurmountable roadblock to more campaign coverage,'' he said. `` I hope the policy will be carried through in future elections.''

Since Oct. 18, proceedings have been dominated by legal wrangling over whether the defense could have free copies of the court file to study at home. Copies of the file can be studied in a court office and the trial has already been postponed half a year to allow the defense more time to better prepare their case. But since the reopening of the trial Oct. 18, the defense has continued to insist on more copies. Each of the Britons facer up to 10 years in jail. Along with the Britons, two Belgian police officers and a former Belgian soccer federation chairman are accused of doing a poor job of organizing security at the match. They face up to two years in jail.

<HEAD>Industry Minister Calls for Quick End to Meat Rationing</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH G. SEWARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The new industry minister called Wednesday for a quick end to meat rationing, and he said the market must determine prices. Meat and gasoline are the only items still rationed since the government introduced widespread rationing in 1980-81. The new minister, <PERSON> Mieczyslaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilczek </PERSON>, said he has always maintained that it was `` abnormal'' that there is food rationing in a country that has 1.25 acres of land per capita. `` We want to lift rationing as soon as possible,'' he said. `` We must be careful with meat prices because we burned ourselves a few times with it. That's not the way. The market should decide how much ham costs.'' Under rationing, each person gets 5 -LCB- pounds of meat a month, except manual laborers, such as miners and steelworkers who receive nearly 10 pounds. Meat also can be bought without ration cards at private meat shops where the price is about three to four times as much as meat bought with the cards. <PERSON> Wilczek </PERSON>, a wealthy private businessman and member of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, outlined his views to improve <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s ailing economy at his first news conference since parliament confirmed him as Industry Minister on Oct. 14. Before joining the government, <PERSON> Wilczek </PERSON> was co-owner with foreign investors of a feed concentrate company, but he has sold his share worth $ 215,000, he said in an interview with the <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wieczorny </ORGANIZATION> newspaper this month. <PERSON> Wilczek </PERSON>'s wealth and private-sector experience have aroused wide interest in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, and he is seen as Prime Minister <PERSON> Mieczyslaw </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rakowski </PERSON>'s most innovative appointment in the new cabinet. The previous government resigned Sept. 19 after fierce criticism for mishandling the party-approved economic reform program and <PERSON> Rakowski </PERSON>, the former party propaganda chief, was approved as the new prime minister Sept. 27. In the past, the government has favored heavy industry, subsidizing inefficient industries such as steel, shipbuilding and coal production, and neglected production of consumer goods and service sectors. But the <PERSON> Rakowski </PERSON> government has decided to put priority on the development of agriculture, housing and environmental protection sectors of the economy and big factories will have to tighten their belts to survive, <PERSON> Wilczek </PERSON> said. `` There are major industrial companies that have negative yield. I understand that as soon as possible those companies must be closed down.'' <PERSON> Wilczek </PERSON> singled out the shipbuilding industry as a target for restructuring. The government has been considering closing the <ORGANIZATION> Lenin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shipyard </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION>, where the Solidarity trade union was born, because it is considered unprofitable. `` Perhaps fewer and fewer shipyards would make for more efficient shipyards,'' <PERSON> Wilczek </PERSON> said, without specifying which ones might be eliminated. He also said that one solution to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s economic problems would be to facilitate the creation of small enterprises, especially service and commercial operations. Laws and rules which hinder the development of light industry will be changed to make it easier for entrepreneurs to do business, he said. Reviving the economy is one of the major challenges facing the government. Inflation is 60 percent, and the foreign debt stands at around $ 40 billion.

 Polish leader Gen. <PERSON> Wojciech </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> primate Cardinal <PERSON> Jozef </PERSON> <PERSON> Glemp </PERSON> met Wednesday at a church palace in the medieval capital city of <LOCATION> Gniezno </LOCATION>, church and state officials said. <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON>, first secretary of the Polish <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- Party, was met <PERSON> Glemp </PERSON> at a church palace in <LOCATION> Gniezno </LOCATION> and toured the city's 14th century Gothic cathedral. The small city in central <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, 145 miles west of <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION>, is the original capital of <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and the seat of Christianity in the country, dating back more than 1,000 years. <PERSON> Glemp </PERSON> is archbishop of <LOCATION> Gniezno </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION>. There was no announcement of the topics of the Jaruzelski-Glemp talks, the latest in a series of meetings between the two in recent years. But the meeting coincided with difficulties over the convening of talks between the authorities and opposition on <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s future. The talks originally were to have begun last week but the government has raised objections to two of the proposed delegates of the banned Solidarity trade union. The church has strongly promoted dialogue between officials and Solidarity, and the leader of the <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligentsia </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Andrzej </PERSON> <PERSON> Stelmachowski </PERSON>, has been a key figure in attempting to set up the talks. The meeting also came after church sources at the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> said the Polish government recently offered to sign a concordat giving a legal basis for church activities in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> in exchange for establishment of full diplomatic relations between <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and the Holy See. The corcordat would replace an agreement that existed between the church and <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s government before World War II which was never renewed after introduction of communist rule.

 The presidents of seven <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> countries arrived Wednesday to seek common positions on strife in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> that has resisted peace efforts. The leaders of the countries, known as the Group of Eight, also will discuss drug trafficking and foreign debt at their sessions Thursday. <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, the eighth member of the group, was suspended after Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, the nation's military leader, ousted President <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON>. Conflict in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> is `` like a red light within a world ... tending toward the solution of regional conflicts,'' <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>'s undersecretary for Latin American affairs, <PERSON> Alberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferrari </PERSON> <PERSON> Etcheberry </PERSON>, said before the meeting Pointing to the Soviet withdrawal from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, the end of <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s war with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, and signs that <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>'s civil war may be winding down, <PERSON> Etcheberry </PERSON> said, `` The case of <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> is not advancing and, on the contrary, is entering a period of paralysis.'' In <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, rebels financed and armed by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> are trying to overthrow the leftist government of President <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. Neighboring <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> has endured a guerrilla war since 1980. Thousands have died in both countries. The Group of Eight is an outgrowth of the so-called <ORGANIZATION> Contadora </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, which was formed in 1983 by <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> to promote peace in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Uruguay </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION> formed the <ORGANIZATION> Contadora </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Support </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> in 1985. A year later, leaders of the eight countries decided to meet regularly and discuss issues on a broader front, including trade, foreign debt and international drug trafficking. Developing a foreign debt strategy may be the most pressing topic on their agenda. The countries are using ever greater shares of their national budgets for repaying that debt, but the money is needed for investment and restructuring their economies. `` You ca n't condemn an entire continent to stagnation because that conspires against hemispheric security and universal justice,'' Argentine President <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON> said in a speech to the World Business Council on Monday. Latin American countries owe more than $ 400 billion to a range of public and private creditors, and the Group of Eight represents more than $ 320 billion of that amount. Aides who have been drafting the final communique for the group also said it will call for a reduction of trade barriers erected by developed countries.

<TEXT>
 Police arrested five Iranian diplomats in eastern <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> who allegedly kidnapped an anti-Khomeini activist and were taking him in the trunk of their car to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Anatolia </ORGANIZATION> news agency said Wednesday. Prosecutor <PERSON> Olcay </PERSON> <PERSON> Seckin </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Erzincan </LOCATION> province was quoted as saying the five were arrested at a gas station about 360 miles from the Iranian border. The <ORGANIZATION> Anatolia </ORGANIZATION> report said a gas station attendent had told police there was a man in the trunk of the Iranians' car. <PERSON> Anatolia </PERSON> did not say when the arrests were made but another news agency, <ORGANIZATION> Hurriyet </ORGANIZATION>, reported they were picked up Sunday. It said military police found <PERSON> Seyit </PERSON> <PERSON> Ebu </PERSON> <PERSON> Hasan </PERSON>, an Iranian engineer, with his arms and legs tied. <PERSON> Seckin </PERSON> could not be reached for comment Wednesday but an official at his office said the five were turned over to police Tuesday. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said they would be delivered for questioning to the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Istanbul </LOCATION>, apparently because the abduction originated there. He would not elaborate. <LOCATION> Erzincan </LOCATION> is 635 miles east of <LOCATION> Istanbul </LOCATION> and a trip by car takes at least 24 hours. In provinces such as <LOCATION> Istanbul </LOCATION>, which is under emergency law, suspects can be held 15 days before charges are brought against them. <PERSON> Anatolia </PERSON> identified the five as <PERSON> Resul </PERSON> <PERSON> Bnnsahalan </PERSON>, <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ghusrorabdullah </PERSON> <PERSON> Pahhul </PERSON>, <PERSON> Hamit </PERSON> <PERSON> Gezo </PERSON> <PERSON> Mehran </PERSON> <PERSON> Baheri </PERSON>, <PERSON> Ramazan </PERSON> <PERSON> Kahlo </PERSON> and <PERSON> Orjan </PERSON> <PERSON> Lihe </PERSON>, and said they were all stationed at <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s consulate in <LOCATION> Istanbul </LOCATION>. A spokeman at the consulate, <PERSON> Musteba </PERSON> <PERSON> Saidi </PERSON>, said there were no diplomats by those names working there. <ORGANIZATION> Hurriyet </ORGANIZATION> reported allegations that the five were Iranian intelligence agents and were trying to smuggle the engineer back to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>.

 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said Wednesday he will keep branding the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> ticket as liberal because `` if the label fits, they ought to wear it.'' At the same time, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, campaigning for Republican nominee <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in mostly Democratic <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>, defended the vice president's hard-driving campaign rhetoric against Democrat <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. `` And now they're squealing, he's running a negative campaign,'' the president said. `` Well, I think they're squirming because <PERSON> George </PERSON> has shown <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> how far outside the mainstream they really are.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s spoke to a fund-raising luncheon for <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> GOP senatorial candidate <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Keyes </PERSON> on the eve of a weeklong campaign foray to <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and several other states. The president will make appearances in <LOCATION> Little </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rock </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ark. </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Springfield </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo. </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> on Thursday before traveling to <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. The White House also announced that toward the end of the trip, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> will attend a rally for Sen. <PERSON> Chip </PERSON> <PERSON> Hecht </PERSON>, R-Nev., in <PERSON> Reno </PERSON> next Tuesday and then go to <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> to campaign for <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> candidate <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Engeleiter </PERSON> Since Labor Day, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has visited 13 states, the bulk of them in the heavily competitive industrial <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> and in key <LOCATION> mid-Atlantic </LOCATION> border states. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> traveled by helicopter to downtown <PERSON> Bltimore </PERSON> in what was his first campaign appearance this year in <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>, a key border state that has been shown by polls to be leaning toward <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> despite its heavy Democratic registration and voting record. Invoking the `` L-word'' _ <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s codeword for liberal _ the president likened <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> to incumbent Sen. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Sarbanes </PERSON>, D-Md., without actually using either one's names `` The incumbent and the stealth candidate at the top of the liberal ticket are so alike they could be twins,'' he said. `` Now, some people think I should n't be using the L-word,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said. `` They say I'm labeling them.'' `` What should we call those people who oppose the death penalty? Who support policies that hand out weekend furloughs to convicted murderers? Who support laws that make it easier for a criminal to own a gun than law-abiding citizens who want to protect their homes and children?'' he asked. `` As I say, I thought about it, and then I decided that if the label fits, they ought to wear it,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> urged <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> Republicans to work hard for <PERSON> Keyes </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> official who is challenging <PERSON> Sarbanes </PERSON>, a Democrat seeking re-election to a third term. The president said <PERSON> Keyes </PERSON> is `` running for <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> against an incumbent you do n't hear a lot about while the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>'s in session. Some say he stays out of the limelight because he does n't like publicity.'' `` I think it's because if the good people of <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> knew more about him, they'd figure out the kind of senator he really is, and he'd have to leave town faster than the guy who packed up the <ORGANIZATION> Colts </ORGANIZATION> and whisked them off to <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> in the middle of the night.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was referring to <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Irsay </PERSON>, owner of the <ORGANIZATION> Indianapolis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Colts </ORGANIZATION> of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Football </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION>, who moved his team out of <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION> at the end of the 1983 season.

 <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s campaign press plane became an airborne collection agency Wednesday under a new pay-as-you-fly rule. It was said to stem from orders from campaign chairman <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> because the campaign is $ 1 million in the red on press travel payments. A memo issued by <PERSON> Alixe </PERSON> <PERSON> Glen </PERSON>, a deputy press secretary, said traveling reporters, photographers and technicians had to pay up immediately, leg by leg, for their travels with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> unless their organizations had paid in advance for the remainder of the campaign. The memo was issued between <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Sioux </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Falls </LOCATION>, and campaign aides then roamed the plane taking credit cards from people whose organizations had n't paid. The campaign estimated the cost per day at about $ 900 per person. `` Until these payments have been made, we must close out your credit card on the last leg of each day,'' the memo said. There were 91 news people traveling with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on this trip.

 For <PERSON> Peggy </PERSON> <PERSON> Say </PERSON>, this is a time of exquisite agony. The brother she has not seen for 3 -LCB- years, hostage <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, marks another birthday Thursday in captivity. <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, the chief <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> correspondent for <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, was abducted on March 16, 1985. He is the longest held of the 14 foreign hostages in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. But Mrs. Say, who is spending <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>'s 41st birthday with family and friends in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, lives with the hope he will be free by the presidential election less than two weeks away. While she waits, she and her husband, <PERSON> David </PERSON>, spend their time trying to prepare for <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>'s homecoming. `` It's such an agony of anticipation,'' Mrs. Say, 47, said during a recent interview at her home in a lakeside community near <LOCATION> Cadiz </LOCATION>. `` On the one hand, having been burned so many times in the past, you try not to think about it. `` I guess it's an exquisite agony,'' she said. `` You know it's going to happen, that you are building up to it You are sure that the long road is at an end. You can actually see it, and yet you have to wait out the time in between.'' The couple moved to western <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Batavia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, earlier this year. Mrs. Say was weeks away from a college degree in social work when <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> was abducted. She left school and has devoted herself since to gaining <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>'s release. Her mission has enabled her to put aside her fear of flying and her uneasiness around crowds. She has led candlelight vigils outside the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and had coffee with President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. In 1986, she made a 5,000-mile trip to the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>. She has appeared on national talk shows and held her own with dignitaries, including <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Kissinger </PERSON>. She has met with former hostages and received letters from people who praised her for her courage. She also has defended her brother's right to have remained in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, when challenged by listeners on radio call-in shows Somewhere along the way she has shed her fear of feeling intimidated. `` The one truth I've learned is that people are just people, no matter what their position. That has made me more comfortable knowing there's nobody I've met up to this point that has intimidated me,'' she said. `` So I doubt that that will ever happen in my lifetime, which is a good feeling to know that no matter what happens you are able to cope.''

 The <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> voted 146-0 on Wednesday to condemn <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s segregated municipal elections. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> abstained. South Africans of all races voted Wednesday for racially segregated municipal councils nationwide. Anti-apartheid activists urged an election boycott, in defiance of state-of-emergency regulations. The <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> resolution, introduced by Ambassador <PERSON> Wilbert </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Chagula </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Tanzania </LOCATION> on behalf of the <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> in the assembly, also blamed the `` <LOCATION> Pretoria </LOCATION> racist regime'' for violence before the balloting, including the bombing of anti-apartheid organization offices. It called the election an `` insidious maneuver by the racist minority regime of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'' that will `` entrench white minority rule'' and cause more conflict. <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrne </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> wants reform and the abolition of apartheid, but could not support the resolution because it was `` unbalanced and biased'' in blaming all the violence on South African officials. She said the resolution failed to mention anti-apartheid guerrillas who bombed public places and targeted election officials for assassination. Sir <PERSON> Crispin </PERSON> <PERSON> Tickell </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> ambassador, also said his nation believes the resolution was one-sided. He said its description of apartheid as `` a threat to international peace and security'' was exaggerated. <PERSON> Tickell </PERSON> said it was unwise to pass resolutions condemning <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> while it is involved in delicate negotiations with <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> on a <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> troop withdrawal from <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> and independence for <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>. The resolution also called for ending <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s ban on opposition political organizations, lifting the state of emergency, withdrawing South African troops from black townships, amnesty for political exiles, and freeing all `` political prisoners'' and detainees. It said <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> should hold elections `` on the basis of universal adult sufferage in an unfragmented <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>.'' Under apartheid, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s 26 million blacks have no vote in national affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and maintain separate districts, schools and health services.

 <PERSON> Shirley </PERSON> <PERSON> Dupuis </PERSON> and her husband hardly spoke a word to each other on the 3 -LCB- - hour ride home The exhilaration of three days earlier had turned into gloom in the woods of northern <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>. They failed to get a moose. `` It's all over but the crying,'' she said this week following <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>'s first moose hunt since 1901. She was among the 75 chosen by lottery for the hunt. Fifty-seven hunters got a moose. They were n't alone in their failure, `` but it sure feels like it,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Dupuis </PERSON>, 34. `` My husband took it pretty hard,'' she said. They had done all the right things: they scouted the area and saw moose before the hunt, and when the season started, they hunted from sunrise to sunset. But they never glimpsed one of the huge animals during the hunt. `` You've just got to be in the right place at the right time,'' she said. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> wildlife officials decided to hold the hunt because of pressure from hunters who said the herd was on the rebound. More than 4,000 moose are in the state, according to estimates. One protest against the hunt was held, but only about a dozen people attended. State officials have scheduled a larger hunt next year. <PERSON> Leslie </PERSON> <PERSON> Reed </PERSON>, 57, of <LOCATION> Concord </LOCATION>, and his partner, <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Clair </PERSON>, had no luck in bagging a moose either. `` I thought for sure, I could almost guarantee we'd get one,'' <PERSON> Reed </PERSON> said. `` We did a lot of scouting and saw a lot of moose,'' <PERSON> Reed </PERSON> said. When the hunt began last Tuesday, they saw a huge bull about 700 yards away shortly after sunrise. But when they tried to sneak up on him, he was gone. Then on Friday, the day after the hunt ended, two moose walked into their camp. All <PERSON> Reed </PERSON> could do was lift his camera instead of his gun.

 Rep. <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> gave up any hope of a pre-election verdict in his perjury trial Wednesday when a judge dismissed the jury because the congressman had mailed out campaign literature mentioning the case. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Vining </PERSON> made it clear there would be no further attempt to seat a jury before the Nov. 8 election. The 12 jurors and two alternates selected over three days were excused before hearing any arguments or testimony. <PERSON> Vining </PERSON> also rejected a request by the two-term Republican to proceed with a non-jury trial, in which the judge renders the verdict. `` I'm disappointed,'' <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> said, but he expressed no regrets over the campaign mailings, one of which included his claim that he passed a private polygraph test about his truthfulness. `` I very much would have liked to have had an exoneration before the election,'' he said. `` However, I knew that with a campaign with only two weeks to go, and with the issue of perjury uppermost in many people's minds, that it was important for me to get that polygraph evidence out to the voters of the 4th District, because it totally exonerates me.'' The government contends an agent posing as a money broker told <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> that an $ 850,000 home mortgage the congressman was seeking might be drug money. Prosecutors said <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> lied in telling a grand jury he did not remember such a warning. The judge, in dismissing the jury, cited two pieces of campaign literature that he said could have reached potential jurors. He said he also wants authorities to investigate whether <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON>, who is representing himself, violated court rules governing the comments lawyers may make about their cases. `` It became apparent this morning that it would be extremely difficult for you to try a case during a political campaign when one of the parties is involved in the campaign,'' <PERSON> Vining </PERSON> told the jurors. Later, he added, `` I just believe myself it's not the time and place to try the case, so I'm not going to.'' <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> is locked in a re-election battle with Democrat <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, a former actor who played Cooter on television's `` Dukes of Hazzard.'' <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> said Wednesday that if there is no verdict before the election he will ask voters to support him with the understanding he would resign if convicted. That approach, he said, would ensure that a new <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> candidate could run. `` I believe they will re-elect me with the understanding that an exoneration after the election is just as good as an exoneration before the election,'' he said. <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> would not comment on the case. `` We had an 18-point lead before the indictment, and we got it not because of his problems, but because of our hard work,'' he said. A poll by The <ORGANIZATION> Atlanta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal-Constitution </ORGANIZATION> after <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON>'s Oct. 17 indictment found <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> leading 53 percent to 27 percent. The campaign, one of the bitterest in the country, has featured <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON>'s repeated questions about <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>' admitted bout with alcoholism. <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> has been hounded by news reports of the investigation that led to his indictment, and <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> once suggested the congressman be tested for drug use and psychiatric problems. <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> gave up the right to make many pre-trial arguments, including a claim that he was being prosecuted for political gain, and successfully pushed for a trial date just a week after the indictment on 10 counts of perjury. Opening arguments had been scheduled for Wednesday, but <PERSON> Vining </PERSON> opened the day's session by introducing the mass mailings into evidence. `` He's showed us he would rather run for office than have this trial,'' said prosecutor <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> Gillen </PERSON>. He said the mailings made it impossible to hold the trial because they could be delivered to jurors' homes even after testimony began or could be mentioned to them by relatives. <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> pleaded with the judge to question the jurors about whether they had received the mailings instead of dismissing the panel, and he renewed his accusation that his indictment was timed to fall just before the election. At a news conference, <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> was questioned repeatedly by reporters about whether he authorized mention of the polygraph in his mailing. He said he had approved the mailing before `` a decision was made'' to add the mention of the polygraph test. Pressed about who made the decision, <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> insisted he had answered the question until his wife broke in to say, `` He did n't; I did.''

<DATELINE>MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Hurricane <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> spawned an intense political storm between the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> and their opponents as it rampaged across <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. President <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> frequently compared the hurricane's assault to attacks by guerrillas and said the best relief aid the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> could offer would be halting aid to the rebels, known as Contras Monsignor <PERSON> Bismarck </PERSON> <PERSON> Carballo </PERSON>, a Roman Catholic church spokesman, accused the government of mixing political slogans with emergency broadcasts. <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> came ashore early Saturday morning at <LOCATION> Bluefields </LOCATION>, flattened the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> port of 38,000 people, and cut a path of destruction across to the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> in the following 24 hours. It killed at least 60 people and left 300,000 homeless. <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> issued a general appeal for emergency assistance. Nations as diverse as <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> responded with aid, but the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> said it probably would not. <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> said Wednesday the hurricane had destroyed a key farming and ranching area in central <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. After touring the region he said <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> wiped out cattle herds, pastures, forests, grain crops, more than 20,000 homes in 22 communities in 40 square miles. The official radio, Voice of <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, described the district 90 miles east of <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION> as the country's main farming and ranching area. Political barbs began last week as the storm approached the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> coast, after the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> approved a resolution leaving open the possibility of renewed aid to the Contras. `` It is inconceivable that, while Nicaraguans face the threat of catastrophe the American <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> maintains its threat to escalate the war,'' <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> said. The Contras and <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> agreed in March to a cease-fire, but further talks broke off in September. Most rebels moved to base camps in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> in the last few months, but both sides still report minor skirmishes. <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s economy has been devastated by seven years of civil war, which the government says has cost $ 7 million. White House spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said Monday of <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON>: `` It seems clear he wants to use this storm as another platform for propaganda against the Contras.'' In his complaints about propaganda during the Hurricane emergency, <PERSON> Carballo </PERSON> said: `` The Voice of <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> started to transmit that neither President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> nor <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> would destroy the revolution.'' Anti-U.S. rhetoric has caused the government problems among the 3 million Nicaraguans. Some refused to evacuate for <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> because, they said, the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> had lost their credibility by warning repeatedly of `` imminent'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> invasions. `` People are tired of hearing these calls and do n't believe them,'' said <PERSON> Ruben </PERSON> <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON>, who refused to leave his home in a poor, low-lying neighborhood of <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION>. Both <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s sole opposition newspaper, <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prensa </ORGANIZATION>, criticized an emergency law that suspended articles of the constitution dealing with freedom of speech for 30 days, which includes the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> election Nov. 8. `` To do it at this time under cover of a storm is no worse really than the performance he has displayed for the past six or seven years in terms of closing down the press,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. While touring devastated <LOCATION> Bluefields </LOCATION> on Monday, <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> might accept <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government hurricane aid if it was offered `` without conditions,'' and expressed certainty that help would come from private American groups that oppose their government's <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> policy. On Tuesday, the pro-government newspaper <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nuevo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Diario </ORGANIZATION> said <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> did not want aid from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said Monday the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> feared any emergency aid it offered would help <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> against the Contras. In reply, the government newspaper <PERSON> Barricada </PERSON> said: `` It's better for the <ORGANIZATION> Yankees </ORGANIZATION> to keep their blankets, milk for children and medicine for our homeless brothers.'' <LOCATION> Bluefields </LOCATION> fisherman <PERSON> Aster </PERSON> <PERSON> Gerth </PERSON> asked a visitor, however: `` Do you think the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will help? The Russians and the Cubans ca n't do what the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> can.'' <PERSON> Roberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Arguello </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Nicaraguan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bankers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, said most Nicaraguan exiles in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> had the attitude: `` Let the <LOCATION> Russians </LOCATION> help them out.'' <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> sent hurricane experts before the storm hit and sheltered Nicaraguan air force planes at its airfields. <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> doctors and emergency supplies arrived immediately after <PERSON> Joan </PERSON>'s departure.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> says the fund insuring savings and loan deposits needs more money, but requiring the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> to help bail it out could `` set a dangerous precedent.'' As savings institution losses have mounted, congressional debate has intensified over whether taxpayers must pay to bailout the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, and over alternatives to tax money. The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, which regulates S & amp; Ls and oversees the insurance fund, maintains the assessment levied on the industry can cover the costs. But many analysts, and now <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON>, agree that the insurance fund's current flow of revenue is n't enough. `` Clearly the <ORGANIZATION> FSLIC </ORGANIZATION> will need additional resources,'' <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> said in a statement released Wednesday by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. But he added that any move to tap the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> for money `` would mark a sharp departure from the view traditionally held in our nation that the resources of the Federal Reserve ... should not be used for special purposes and would set a dangerous precedent for the future.'' He also said that `` funding from the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> would add to the federal budget deficit essentially in the same way as a budget expenditure.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>, as the nation's central bank, uses its funds to control inflation in the economy, intervene in foreign exchange markets and act as a lender of last resort during financial crises such as the October 1987 stock market crash. <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON>'s remarks, made in a statement dated Oct. 17, were offered in response to questions, submitted July 29 by the <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, on a wide range of subjects. Sen. <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Riegle </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, D-Mich., who is expected to become chairman of the committee next year, asked <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> about a proposal to require the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> to pay interest on reserves it hold from <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> commercial banks and channel the money to the <ORGANIZATION> FSLIC </ORGANIZATION> Another suggestion would require the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> to accept as collateral for loans <ORGANIZATION> FSLIC </ORGANIZATION> notes issued to ailing S & amp; Ls. <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> offered no solution to the S & amp; L crisis but said his agency would express its views when <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> takes up the topic. In the meantime, he said the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banks </ORGANIZATION> would act as a lender of last resort to S & amp; Ls in trouble if the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> system can not. His comments came three weeks after <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Seidman </PERSON>, chairman of the insurance fund for commercial banks, told the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bankers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> he would fight any attempt to tap the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deposit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. Government estimates have put the cost of restoring the S & amp; L industry to solvency at $ 45 billion to $ 50 billion, with private analysts setting the cost at up to $ 100 billion <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> said `` great uncertainty'' surrounds estimates of S & amp; L losses because `` relatively small changes'' in the value of real estate securing loans to troubled institutions `` can have a major impact on the magnitude of thrift industry losses.'' `` But ... it is clear that the <ORGANIZATION> FSLIC </ORGANIZATION> is facing large problems which are going to be with us for some time to come,'' he said.

<HEAD>`Low-Input' Farming Pushed as Answer to Pesticide Problem</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The government should step up research and promotion of so-called low-input farming to halt contamination of groundwater with nitrates and pesticides, a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> panel said Wednesday. `` Given the seriousness of the problems besetting agriculture today, the least we can do is ensure that this option is available for farmers,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Synar </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Okla </LOCATION>., chairman of the environment, energy and natural resources subcommittee The panel released a report based on a year-long investigation of the pesticide issue, `` Low Input Farming Systems: Benefits and Barriers.'' Low-input farming refers to techniques ranging from chemical-free, or `` organic'' agriculture, to the careful targeting and reduced use of chemical pesticides on crops. The <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> estimates that of 1.1 billion pounds of pesticides used in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in 1984, 77 percent, or 861 million pounds, were applied to agricultural crops. These chemicals, some of which have been linked to cancer and other health problems, along with nitrates from agricultural fertilizers have increasingly been found in groundwater which furnishes the major drinking supply to almost half of all Americans. `` While a low-input management system is not a cure-all for agriculture's troubles, it offers the potential of improving the efficiency of farm operations by lowering input costs and reducing contaminants that end up in the soil and groundwater,'' <PERSON> Synar </PERSON> said. The panel reported that even when cutting back on pesticides had reduced crop yield, some farmers reported greater net earnings because of reduced production costs. But the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> has focused little attention on non-chemical methods in reaching its regulatory decisions, the report said. Poor coordination between the agency and the <ORGANIZATION> agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> department </ORGANIZATION> are to blame, it said. The panel also cited an array of barriers to widespread adoption of low-input methods to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> farming. They included: lack of research, chemical industry influence on farmers, limited information available and worry among agricultural producers that switching to alternative production methods would risk short-term income loss. In 1985, the report said, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> authorized the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> to develop a low-input farming methods program. It said, however, that the department did not request money for it and that it remained unfunded until lawmakers approved $ 4.1 million in the fiscal year that ended last month.

 Federal prosecutors Wednesday accused 27 people, including a <PERSON> Ku </PERSON> <PERSON> Klux </PERSON> <PERSON> Klansman </PERSON> and a <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> lawyer, of taking part in an eight-state ring that distributed cocaine and marijuana and manufactured methamphetamine. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Barr </PERSON> said the drug and money-laundering charges were contained in an indictment returned Friday that also seeks the seizure of a golf course. The indictment identifies <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Miles </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Norcross </LOCATION> as the ringleader. <PERSON> Barr </PERSON> said 16 of the 27 defendants, including Miles, had been arrested and prosecutors were asking they be held without bail. The ring operated in <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, with most of the manufacturing of methamphetmine, or `` speed,'' done in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Barr </PERSON> said. The indictment seeks the forfeiture of 15 pieces of land, including a golf course in Winder worth more than $ 3 million and 23 vehicles worth about $ 200,000. Most of those named in the indictment are from <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, including <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON>, an attorney in middle <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Monroe </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>. He is accused of using drug proceeds to make purchases for Miles.

 A national poll Wednesday gave <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> an eight-point advantage over <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> in the race for president, a somewhat smaller lead than the Republican nominee enjoyed in two earlier polls this week. The <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News-Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> poll of 1,242 likely voters put the contest at 52-44 percent, closer than the 13-point gap in a <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News-New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> poll and the 14 points among likely voters in a Gallup poll released Tuesday. The ABC-Post poll was conducted during the seven days ending Tuesday, rather than the three - and four-day field periods of the earlier polls That could account for differing results. Polls done during fewer days are more liable to be influenced by daily movements in voter preference. In polls done over more time, changes may be tempered by days of stable opinion. ABC-Post polls have showed slight movement in the race, with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> ahead by six points in an Oct. 5-11 poll, seven in an Oct. 12-18 poll and eight now. The Gallup and CBS-Times polls, done in shorter periods, found more movement for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> after the Oct. 13 presidential debate. The margin of sampling error in the <ORGANIZATION> ABC-Post </ORGANIZATION> poll was plus or minus three percentage points.

 Guerrillas shot and killed a policeman and wounded another in an ambush Wednesday, and a car bomb killed a <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> manager outside <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION>'s main postal sorting office, police said. No group immediately claimed responsibility for the attacks, which occurred 70 miles apart and within minutes of each other, around 7 p.m. -LRB- 3 p.m. EDT -RRB-. The policemen had just come off duty and were traveling to <LOCATION> Enniskillen </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fermanagh </LOCATION> when their private car was raked with gunfire near the village of <LOCATION> Kinawley </LOCATION>, 70 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION>, said police Sgt. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Glover </PERSON>. Both men were seriously wounded and one later died of his injuries, police said. Their identities were not immediately released. In central <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION>, a booby-trap bomb exploded under a car in a multi-story parking lot across the road from the city's main sorting office, killing a Post Office transport manager. The official, who was not immediately identified, got into the car after leaving work and had driven a short distance toward the exit when the blast destroyed his car, <PERSON> Glover </PERSON> said. The victim apparently had no connection with the security forces, which are targeted by the <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Glover </PERSON> said. The outlawed, <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> guerrilla group is fighting to drive the British out of <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> and unite the Protestant-dominated province with the <LOCATION> Catholic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> under socialist rule. A total of 2,703 people are known to have been killed since political and sectarian violence erupted in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> in 1969.

 Republican <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> sounded like a man counting down the hours to victory in the race for the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday as he renewed his pledge not to raise taxes. Democrat <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> vowed `` to work, to campaign and to win'' despite the odds against him. The latest news from the pollsters was anything but good for the Democrats. A <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> survey in <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> _ one of the nation's most Democratic states _ showed <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> with a nine-point lead, on top of two national polls Tuesday that showed a double-digit Democratic deficit. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s lead was back down to a single digit in an <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News-Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> poll released late Tuesday in which he was ahead by 52-44. The survey of 1,242 likely voters was conducted during seven days _ a longer sampling period than in the other surveys _ and has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points. The vice president began his campaign day in <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>, where he said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> sounds like a man `` just itching to repeal'' the income tax cuts of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> era. The vice president also defended his call for a capital gains tax cut from <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' criticism. `` It's not a tax break for the rich. It is a break for those who want to have a job in this country,'' he said. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was in <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>, meeting privately with Hispanic leaders who later said high voter turnout among their constituents could deliver a Democratic upset on Election Day. He laid claim to strong Hispanic support and said that was due in part to his stand against drugs. `` They want a president who does n't talk about the subject but who has done something about it,'' he said. In <LOCATION> Pueblo </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> defended his record on gun control in a region where he has been under heavy advertising attack from the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rifle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said he does not oppose gun ownership by hunters and sportsmen and for protection. `` I hope you'll take that word back to your friends and neighbors,'' he said. `` These charges are a lot of baloney and I hope you'll tell them that.'' Advisers insisted the campaign's own polling reflects a closer race than the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> lead in national polls. Said the candidate, `` The pollsters are not going to call this election. It's the people who are going to be voting.'' He added he would go `` on across this country to work, to campaign and to win.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> optimistically looked beyond the election. `` If I am elected in 13 days, 8 hours and 22 minutes from now ... I will work with <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> _ got to do that _ telling them the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people in electing me voted against a tax increase,'' he said. `` Now let's sit down together, honor the people's decision, and hold spending increases to the rate of inflation.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also contended that there have been a `` staggering'' number of jobs created as a result of Reagan-era tax cuts. `` My opponent thinks they were a disaster,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` Those sound to me like the words of someone who is just itching to repeal one of the most successful economic policies in our history.'' President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> ventured into Democratic <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> and said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has unjustly accused <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> of running a negative campaign. `` Well, I think they're squirming because <PERSON> George </PERSON> has shown <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> how far outside the mainstream they really are,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION>. `` They may not like it, but <PERSON> George </PERSON> has thrown a clear light on their views.'' Democratic vice presidential candidate <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, interviewed live on the CBS Evening News, nonetheless urged <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to `` root'' out the distortions that he is allowing in the campaign. When asked by anchorman <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Rather </PERSON> whether the campaign was n't being hypocritical because it had n't dealt often with black leaders and voters, <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said he and <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> had participated recently in a joint satellite session with college students The two men were in separate cities for that event. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> also said he planned to appear with <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> this week. Campaign officials said afterward the event was still tentative because of <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s schedule. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s running mate, <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, was asked about a <ORGANIZATION> CBS-New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> poll that indicated he was the most unpopular of the four men at the top of the presidential tickets. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is `` the person that is unpopular in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> ... he's dragging his ticket down.'' When reporters pressed the <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> senator about whether he might be costing <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> some votes, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said, `` As a matter of fact, when we got on this ticket we were double-digits behind, and we're doing quite well.''

 A male calendar contest at a popular nightclub is causing a stir in this northern <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> city, and the club's owner says there would n't be a problem if the contestants were women instead of men. The Monday night performance, billed as `` The Men of Menagerie Calendar Contest,'' took place as scheduled at the Glass Menagerie, but city officials say the show must not go on. The matter has been turned over to the city's legal advisers, said Zoning Administrator <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Hopper </PERSON>. <PERSON> Hopper </PERSON> warned the nightclub's owner that the contest violates city zoning ordinances on adult entertainment and ordered the club to halt the show or face a fine. About an hour before the Monday performance, Lt. <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Schawe </PERSON> delivered <PERSON> Hopper </PERSON>'s order. But the show went on anyway. `` It was a very professional show. The costumes were fantastic,'' said Detective <PERSON> Marty </PERSON> <PERSON> Epperson </PERSON>, a plainclothes officer who went to the contest to serve as a witness for the city. Participants wore costumes at the beginning and stripped down to G-strings while music played, she said. The nightclub is in a highway commercial zone in which adult entertainment is prohibited. The club could face a fine of $ 10 to $ 500 per day, and its liquor license could be jeopardized. The contest is no different than female calendar contests sponsored by other Covington nightspots, said Glass Menagerie owner <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Grause </PERSON>. Participants `` strut their stuff'' for the audience, which chooses the winner by applause, he said. `` As far as we're concerned, this a sexist type of attack,'' <PERSON> Grause </PERSON> said. `` Obviously, it was generated by our competitors because it was a successful promotion.'' <PERSON> Hopper </PERSON> said he was unaware of similar contests at other nightspots.

 Hundreds of people marched through the capital on Wednesday, the first anniversary of a human rights leader's slaying, and <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> said right-wing death squads have re-emerged. About 500 people attended a religious service honoring <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Anaya </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanabria </PERSON>, then marched through the capital to lay flowers at his grave. <PERSON> Anaya </PERSON>, 33, was gunned down on Oct. 26, 1987, near his home in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>. He was the fifth director of the <ORGANIZATION> Salvadoran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> to be assassinated since 1980. The government blamed the crime on the leftist guerrilla <ORGANIZATION> Farabundo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marti </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>. But <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> and humanitarian groups say it was the work of a rightist death squad. <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>, the London-based human rights group, said death squads, usually including soldiers or police, have killed hundreds of people suspected of being leftists or government opponents in the past two years. It said death squads are re-emerging because of military opposition to peace negotiations with the front and that <PERSON> Anaya </PERSON>'s slaying was seen as an attempt to discourage the talks Soldiers and death squads killed tens of thousands of suspected leftists in the 1970s and early 1980s, but death squad activity diminished after the U.S.-backed civilian government came to power in 1984. Col. <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Galileo </PERSON> refused to comment on the <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> report, but he said the armed forces would issue a bulletin on the issue later, possibly Thursday. The government said the guerrilla front killed <PERSON> Anaya </PERSON> because he left the front to collaborate with the military. It said a suspected guerrilla, <PERSON> Jorge </PERSON> <PERSON> Alberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Miranda </PERSON> <PERSON> Arevalo </PERSON>, admitted killing <PERSON> Anaya </PERSON>. <PERSON> Miranda </PERSON>, 19, says he was forced to confess to a crime he did not commit. <PERSON> Anaya </PERSON>'s widow, <PERSON> Mirna </PERSON> <PERSON> Perla </PERSON>, told a news conference Wednesday that <PERSON> Miranda </PERSON> is `` another innocent victim.'' In another incident Wednesday, two guerrillas broke into a radio station in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> on Wednesday and broadcast a tape attacking <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON>'s government. The guerrillas were gone by the time police arrived. The guerrillas have been fighting the U.S.-backed armed forces for nine years. An estimated 65,000 people, most of them civilians, have died in the war.

 <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> warplanes attacked <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> guerrilla bases at <LOCATION> Sidon </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> on Wednesday, killing at least six people, including a man identified as a senior <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> commander. A family of six and three other people were missing and feared dead under the rubble in <LOCATION> Mieh </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mieh </LOCATION>, a refugee camp outside <LOCATION> Sidon </LOCATION> that suffered the greatest damage. Police said 41 people were wounded, all but one at <LOCATION> Mieh </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mieh </LOCATION>. In south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers and allied militiamen poured artillery fire on positions of Lebanese guerrillas in and around <LOCATION> Mashgara </LOCATION>, police reported. They said it might be a prelude to a ground thrust. Jets struck targets outside the southern port and the capital 4 -LCB- hours apart in the third and fourth raids since a suicide Shiite Moslem car bomber killed eight <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers a week ago in the border `` security zone'' <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> maintains in south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. At least 27 people have been killed and 16 wounded in the four raids, which bring the total <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> air strikes in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> this year to 19. Police say at least 95 have been killed and 184 wounded in all the raids. In <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> military spokesman later said the planes blasted suspected guerrilla bases in southern <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> three times Wednesday _ although <LOCATION> Lebanese </LOCATION> police reported two raids _ with all aircraft home safe after scoring accurate hits. Under military regulations, the spokesman was not identified. He said the planes bombed sites around <LOCATION> Damour </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> after raiding targets near <LOCATION> Sidon </LOCATION>. `` The raid near <LOCATION> Sidon </LOCATION> is one of the heaviest, if not the heaviest, in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> this year,'' said a police spokesman, whose name can not be used because of regulations. He said it caused `` the most severe destruction in <LOCATION> Mieh </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mieh </LOCATION> since the 1982 Israeli invasion.'' Among those killed in the refugee camp was Col. <PERSON> Mustafa </PERSON> <PERSON> Daoud </PERSON>, 40, commander of the <ORGANIZATION> Fatah </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Militia </ORGANIZATION>, a guerrilla group of about 1,000 fighters from the mainstream <ORGANIZATION> Fatah </ORGANIZATION> faction led by <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>, police said. Most of the wounded were guerrillas and included Col. <PERSON> Mohsen </PERSON> <PERSON> Hallak </PERSON>, commander of the 1,000-man Beit al-Maqdes -LRB- <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> -RRB- battalion, another <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> unit, the police spokesman reported. He said some others were officers of Force 17, the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> security service. Police said the second Israeli raid struck bases of pro-Syrian Palestinian factions in the hills of <LOCATION> Khalde </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Aramoun </PERSON> on <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>'s southern fringe They described the main target as a base behind a hilltop monastery overlooking the towns of <LOCATION> Damour </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Naameh </LOCATION>, midway along the coastal highway between <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Sidon </LOCATION>. The port city is about 25 miles south of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. The raiding jets struck twice within 15 minutes, firing 10 air-to-surface rockets, four of which failed to explode, the report said. Journalists were not allowed to approach the base, which consists of half a dozen tents belonging to the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> for the Liberation of <LOCATION> Palestine </LOCATION>. Syrian anti-aircraft batteries near <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> airport and <PERSON> Aramoun </PERSON> fired at attackers but police said they claimed no hits. Police in the south said four fighter-bombers streaked in from the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> at 11 a.m. and fired 12 rockets into Mieh Mieh and nearby <PERSON> Ein </PERSON> el-Dilb hill in three passes spread over eight minutes. `` At least 30 buildings within a radius of 150 meters in <LOCATION> Mieh </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mieh </LOCATION>'s central square were pulverized,'' the police spokesman said. `` Many victims, including a family of six living in an abandoned <ORGANIZATION> UNRWA </ORGANIZATION> school are still buried in he rubble.'' The U.N. Relief and Works Agency aids Palestinian refugees. <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> military commander for the <LOCATION> Sidon </LOCATION> region, said: `` It's a massacre. Plenty of people are buried in the debris.'' A guerrilla who gave his name as <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Khaled </PERSON> said: `` It was so swift that we could n't look up at the sky to fire back at the planes.'' <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> said the raids followed two unsuccessful attempts by Palestinian guerrillas Tuesday to infiltrate into <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> television said Israeli-backed militiamen from the Christian village of <LOCATION> Jezzine </LOCATION> in southern <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> destroyed a guerrilla outpost near <LOCATION> Libah </LOCATION>, east of <LOCATION> Sidon </LOCATION>. It said the mainly Christian force killed one Moslem militiaman, captured three and suffered two casualties, not specified. The outpost was on a hill overlooking <LOCATION> Jezzine </LOCATION> and subjected the town to constant artillery bombardments. <PERSON> Bassam </PERSON> <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharif </PERSON>, chief spokesman for <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>, claimed in <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, that <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> troops were massing for an attack on Palestinian and Lebanese forces at <LOCATION> Sidon </LOCATION>.

 The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> will release all people regarded in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> as political prisoners by the end of the year, Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> said Wednesday after talks with President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. Such a dramatic move would be one of the boldest signs yet from <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> that he seeks a clear break with past Kremlin human rights practices that have included imprisonment of dissenters from <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> policy. However, <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Gennady </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON> refused to confirm or deny that a release of political prisoners is imminent. He told reporters there are about two dozen such prisoners. Estimates from human rights groups abroad vary from 150 to more than 500. <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON> said the fate of the prisoners was not on the agenda of the Soviet-West German negotiations that brought <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>'s announcement was welcomed by Soviet human rights activist <PERSON> Andrei </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON>, President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>. But a leader of a group seeking emigration of Soviet Jews said he remained skeptical. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, asked what he thought of the report, said, `` I'm hoping that's true.'' <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON>, the 1975 Nobel Peace laureate, said, `` Certainly we await the release of all of them -LRB- prisoners -RRB- and their rehabilitation.'' In the past three days, <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> held 10 hours of talks with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and also met with other top Kremlin officials. At a news conference called to sum up his visit, <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> said: `` The Soviets confirmed that they will release before the end of the year all political prisoners as we understand it in the West.'' <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> would not say whether the promise came from <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, only that it was made during the talks. Asked how many people may be freed, <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>'s foreign minister, <PERSON> Hans-Dietrich </PERSON> <PERSON> Genscher </PERSON>, said: `` We are not in a position to give final figures.'' Neither <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> nor <PERSON> Genscher </PERSON> identified prisoners who might be released. It was not clear how many Soviets classified in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> as political prisoners might be freed, since some have been sentenced on criminal charges, including espionage. <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>, the London-based human rights group, says it knows of 150 Soviets `` imprisoned solely for their non-violent exercise of their fundamental human rights.'' It put their number at 10,000 a few years ago. Amnesty's list includes about 30 religious believers, 30 conscientious objectors to military service, and about 20 people held for anti-Soviet propaganda and other offenses, said spokeswoman <PERSON> Carline </PERSON> <PERSON> Windall </PERSON>. Upon request, <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> office named four people on the list of 150 believed to be prisoners of conscience: <PERSON> Levko </PERSON> <PERSON> Lukyanenko </PERSON>, a Ukrainian lawyer and member of an unofficial <ORGANIZATION> Helsinki </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Watch </ORGANIZATION> committee, in internal exile in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Boris </PERSON> <PERSON> Mityashin </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION> truck driver, imprisoned for distributing poetry disapproved of by the government; <PERSON> Vazif </PERSON> <PERSON> Meylanov </PERSON>, in a labor camp since 1980 for demonstrating for <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON>'s release, and <PERSON> Enn </PERSON> <PERSON> Tarto </PERSON>, an Estonian, also held in a labor camp. <PERSON> Kronid </PERSON> <PERSON> Lubarsky </PERSON>, editor of Country and World, the respected emigre publication in <LOCATION> Munich </LOCATION>, said there are at least 167 Soviet political prisoners. A West German group, the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION>, said 503 Soviets are imprisoned on political or religious grounds. Many of those sent to labor camp or prisons for political offenses have been convicted under two clauses of the Soviet Criminal Code. Article 70 outlaws `` anti-Soviet agitation and propaganda.'' Article 190 forbids `` anti-Soviet slander.'' `` The only number we know is -LRB- those held under Article -RRB- 70, and only those in camps,'' <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> said in a telephone interview. He put the total number of those prisoners at 25. `` We do n't know who is in psychiatric hospitals,'' said <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON>, who was kept almost seven years in internal exile for condemning the 1979 Soviet military push into <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> said it was also not known how many were imprisoned for violating laws that regulate the practice of religion. <PERSON> Sergei </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Grigoryants </PERSON>, one of the first political prisoners released under an amnesty last year, said in an interview that he has a list of 200 people put in camps or psychiatric hospitals for their political beliefs. He said he was skeptical of <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>'s announcement. `` When authorities themselves decide who is a political prisoner, it's difficult to believe that all will really be freed,'' said <PERSON> Grigoryants </PERSON>, editor of Glasnost, an unsanctioned political journal In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, the chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> on Soviet Jewry, <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> <PERSON> Abram </PERSON>, also said he was skeptical. `` One will have to wait to see whether or not the promise is confirmed by the practice,'' <PERSON> Abram </PERSON> told The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. Last year, authorities freed at least 300 prisoners being held on charges including Articles 70 and 190. The ruling <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and government are reviewing the Soviet penal code. `` We are going to make some real innovations,'' Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> on Oct. 11. `` When the code is published and debated, there will no longer be any need to speak of political prisoners.'' <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> said `` about 25 to 29'' Soviets were also confined to mental institutions, apparently for political offenses. For decades, the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION>'s image in the West has been tarnished by the use of prisons, labor camps, mental hospitals and internal exile to isolate and punish dissenters or political and religious activists.

<TEXT>
 The director of the police training council that supervised an academy where 16 cadets were hospitalized from exhaustion stepped down Wednesday amid a series of investigations. <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Egan </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Criminal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Training </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, was placed on leave of absence until the state attorney general's office determines what felled cadets at the police academy in <LOCATION> Agawam </LOCATION>. A statement issued by the council said <PERSON> Egan </PERSON> `` felt his continued presence in the midst of press attention was interfering with the agency's ability to carry out its job of training police throughout the commonwealth.'' At least 16 recruits in a class of 50 were hospitalized with dehydration, exhaustion and kidney failure by the end of the first week of training at the western <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> academy last month. One recruit had a liver transplant and was in a coma for two weeks. Public Safety Secretary <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> asked <PERSON> Egan </PERSON> to take the leave from his $ 53,000-a-year job, according to sources in the state Executive Office of Public Safety, which is monitoring the council. Attorney General <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shannon </PERSON> has been investigating what caused the cadets to collapse and what role was played by the physical and stress training program they were undergoing. In addition, a panel appointed by Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is reviewing the council's training procedures. <PERSON> Shannon </PERSON> also is investigating reports of financial and hiring improprieties on the staff of the 24-member council, which is comprised of police, sheriff, corrections and other law enforcement officials. The council runs five of 15 police training centers in the state, including the <LOCATION> Agawam </LOCATION> facility. It certifies and provides technical assistance to the other 10, which are operated by local or county law enforcement agencies. The Agawam academy was closed Sept. 21 for the investigation. Cadets are being trained at a National Guard barracks in <LOCATION> Agawam </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 The tremendous publicity given to the rescue of whales stranded off <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> has some people questioning the relative values of animal and human life, the president of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Notre </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dame </ORGANIZATION> said. The Rev. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> `` Monk'' <PERSON> Malloy </PERSON> told about 300 people at a `` social concern forum'' Tuesday that he was an animal lover, but that the rescue attempts are `` more of a public relations effort to appease certain elements in the ecology movement, to show that the government cares.'' <PERSON> Malloy </PERSON> cited the whale rescue, along with longstanding social concerns such as abortion and hunger in the world, as issues members of the audience should use to help examine their ethics in a context of being part of a global community. `` We realize we are one in the midst of many and we have to ask, ` Can we hone in on one issue or a set of interconnected issues?''' <PERSON> Malloy </PERSON> said that well-meaning people caught up by one concern should not overlook related problems. He noted that civil strife and corrupt governments in <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> sometimes divert aid offered by people moved by heart-wrenching photographs of starving children. `` So, in the efforts to deal with the broad-based concerns of hunger, good will alone will not help, and we should be prudent,'' <PERSON> Malloy </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Malloy </PERSON> argued that even in the drive against abortion, which is a major concern of the <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> he serves, it is important to look beyond a single issue. `` Being pro-life has served as a rallying cry for some Christians,'' he said. `` But pro-life should include more than life in the womb. Concern should also be given to the life of an infant, the life of the elderly and the life of the mentally, physically and spiritually handicapped.''

<TEXT>
 A Roman Catholic priest who advocated a more compassionate view of homosexuality and later revealed that he was gay has been excommunicated by a church tribunal for joining the <ORGANIZATION> Episcopal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>. The tribunal dismissed <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Dorn </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> from the `` clerical state'' and banned him from the priesthood forever. It found him guilty of leaving the Vatican-ruled church in favor of the Britain-based <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> denomination. The ruling puts an end to a two-year public dispute in which <PERSON> Dorn </PERSON> and the <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> clashed over his outspoken challenges to church teachings on homosexuality and his ultimate revelation that he is gay. `` It's over,'' said <PERSON> Dorn </PERSON>, 36, after learning of the ruling Tuesday. The tribunal's ruling was dated Sept. 30 and delivered Tuesday to <PERSON> Dorn </PERSON> by his church-appointed lawyer, the Rev. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Zusy </PERSON> of the Archdiocese of <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Paul </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Dorn </PERSON> said that he was not allowed to keep a copy of the decree and was ordered not to speak about it. However, he notified the media and issued a statement critical of the church hierarchy. <PERSON> Zusy </PERSON> refused to discuss the matter, saying, `` I can not say a word. I am bound to secrecy.'' Former St. Cloud Bishop <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Speltz </PERSON> suspended, then fired <PERSON> Dorn </PERSON> from his job at the <ORGANIZATION> Christ </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Newman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> at St. Cloud State University in October 1986. <PERSON> Speltz </PERSON> was angered by a controversial article <PERSON> Dorn </PERSON> had written for the St. Cloud Visitor, the diocesan newspaper. The article advocated a more compassionate view of homosexuality, which <PERSON> Dorn </PERSON> called a `` gift from God.'' In June, the three-member tribunal met in Park Rapids at the order of Bishop <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Balke </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Crookston </LOCATION>, where <PERSON> Dorn </PERSON> was ordained in 1979. <PERSON> Dorn </PERSON> on several occasions declined an invitation to come back to the church on the condition he remain silent about homosexuality. Commenting on the church's action, <PERSON> Dorn </PERSON> said that by silencing priests who challenge traditional doctrine, church officials are losing touch with people and closing doors on the oppressed. `` In fear, -LRB- church officials -RRB- cling to the vestiges of power,'' he said. `` They speak only to themselves, and so believe they are mighty.'' <PERSON> Dorn </PERSON>, who lives in south <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION>, declined to discuss his personal life or possible plans to seek ordination in the <ORGANIZATION> Episcopal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>.

 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> late Wednesday lauded the efforts of the crew members of two Soviet icebreakers, among others, for their work leading to the freeing of two whales trapped in the Arctic ice. `` I am gratified that the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> gray whales have been released to the open sea,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said in a statement read by <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Weinberger </PERSON>, a White House spokesman. `` The human persistence and determination by so many individuals on behalf of these whales shows mankind's concern for the environment,'' he said. `` It has been an inspiring endeavor. `` We thank and congratulate the crews of the two Soviet icebreakers who finally broke through to the whales. They were part of a remarkable team effort _ by governments, individuals and business. Due to all these efforts, the whales have returned to the sea.'' The whales that had been imprisoned nearly three weeks were headed out to open sea Wednesday after two Soviet ice-breaking vessels smashed a pathway to them from the sea. Breathing holes had been cut for the whales by Americans working in the opposite direction. A third whale that also had been trapped is believed to have died last week.

<TEXT>
 Far-right white candidates scored major gains Wednesday, but black militants also showed their political strength by boycotting the first same-day voting by all races for segregated municipal councils. In major black townships, where anti-apartheid activists urged a boycott in defiance of state-of-emergency regulations, turnouts generally were below 10 percent. The government said the total black turnout, including advance votes, would exceed the 21 percent recorded in the previous black elections in 1983. But in <LOCATION> Soweto </LOCATION>, whose 2 million residents comprise the largest black community in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, election officials acknowledged their disappointment at an overall turnout of 11.5 percent. The government's <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> said 30 percent of the 25,428 eligible black voters turned out in <LOCATION> Natal </LOCATION>, one of the four provinces. Black and white polling stations were heavily guarded by security forces. No serious violence was reported, although police said scattered arson and stone-throwing attacks did occur. President P.W. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> faced a fierce challenge from the extreme-right <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, which entered local elections for the first time since it was formed eight years ago. Many white communities had their first partisan local elections after decades of Nationalist dominance. The most important white battleground was <LOCATION> Pretoria </LOCATION>, the administrative capital, where the Nationalists won 22 of 42 council seats and the Conservatives 19. The other seat went to an independent. In the port city of <LOCATION> Durban </LOCATION>, right-wing candidates opposed to the integration of beaches won two seats from incumbents on the traditionally liberal city council. In <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION>, the largest city, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> gained outright control at the expense of liberal candidates. The Conservatives decisively beat a <ORGANIZATION> Nationalist </ORGANIZATION> candidate in <LOCATION> Mayfair </LOCATION> <LOCATION> West </LOCATION>, a blue-collar ward where non-whites have been moving in violation of segregation laws. `` This shows our people reject the government's move to the left,'' said the Conservative victor, <PERSON> Hendrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Classen </PERSON>. `` We want white areas.'' The Conservatives also swept to power in most rural northern towns and traded victories with the Nationalists in blue-collar urban areas. Final results were expected Thursday. Nationwide, 7,229 seats were at stake in 1,071 communities. The state radio said only 905 of the 1,839 black council seats were being contested, with no candidates for 138 seats. Of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s 26 million blacks, 1,464,198 were eligible to vote in contested elections. Polling hours varied, with the earliest voting at 7 a.m. and the final balloting at 9 p.m. Anti-apartheid clergymen such as Anglican Archbishop <PERSON> Desmond </PERSON> <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON>, winner of the 1984 Nobel Peace Prize, opposed the elections and urged <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africans </LOCATION> to fast and pray during the day. The <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> voted 146-0 on Wednesday to condemn the elections. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> abstained. The government spent millions of dollars on advertising to promote a high turnout, contending that it was broadening democracy even though blacks can not vote in national elections. Critics say turnout percentages will have little meaning because millions of blacks were ineligible to vote. Many leading black opposition groups are banned. One black who did vote, <PERSON> Siza </PERSON> <PERSON> Zwane </PERSON>, said national issues did n't prompt him to vote for the <ORGANIZATION> Sofasonke </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, whose candidates in <LOCATION> Soweto </LOCATION> have been criticized for making sweeping promises `` We are going to pay less rent, and they will make the roads much better,'' <PERSON> Zwane </PERSON> said. Many schools in black, mixed-race and <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> townships near <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION> were virtually deserted as students stayed away to protest the elections. The <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> won 26 percent of the vote in May 1987 national elections. Its leaders believe they could seriously challenge the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> in parliamentary elections expected by 1990. The Conservatives view <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>'s gradual race reforms as capitulation to the black majority and seek to reimpose strict segregation. Under apartheid, the 5 million whites control the economy and maintain separate districts, schools and health services. The Conservatives want to toughen enforcement of residential segregation and restrict blacks' presence in urban areas. They campaigned on these issues even though they could not implement them unless they ended the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s 40-year hold on national power. Municipal councils can evict squatters and segregate parks, public buildings and transportation facilities. Bombings and grenade attacks have averaged more than one a day in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> since September. Police say the attacks were part of a campaign by <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> guerrillas to disrupt the elections.

 <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> hostage <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> marks his 41st birthday Thursday as he has his last three: in the hands of Shiite Moslem kidnappers.

He was snatched March 16, 1985, off the streets of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> by pro-Iranian extremists who have issued numerous threats against his life. To mark the day, a radio station and merchants group in <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>'s hometown of <LOCATION> Batavia </LOCATION> are sponsoring a birthday party with a huge cake decorated with 1,321 candles, one for each day of the journalist's captivity. Organizers are freezing a portion of the cake to give <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> when he is freed. `` The community has n't forgot him,'' said <PERSON> Terri </PERSON> <PERSON> Fritz </PERSON> of radio station WBAT.

<TEXT>
 A federal courtroom rocked to <ORGANIZATION> Creedence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Clearwater </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revival </ORGANIZATION> records Wednesday as lawyers for former lead singer <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Fogerty </PERSON> tried to show that a song from his 1985 comeback album was n't stolen from another <PERSON> Fogerty </PERSON> hit. Fantasy Records, which recorded Creedence, has filed suit essentially accusing <PERSON> Fogerty </PERSON> of plagiarizing himself. The suit against <PERSON> Fogerty </PERSON> and his current recording company, <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bros. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Records </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, contends `` Old Man Down the Road,'' a single from <PERSON> Fogerty </PERSON>'s solo `` Centerfield'' album, copied the melody from `` Run Through the Jungle,'' which <PERSON> Fogerty </PERSON> wrote and sang for <LOCATION> Creedence </LOCATION> in 1970 and to which Fantasy now owns the rights Relations between <PERSON> Fogerty </PERSON> and his former recording company have been bitter since Creedence disbanded in 1972. <PERSON> Fogerty </PERSON> had to change the title of one song in `` Centerfield'' after <PERSON> Saul </PERSON> <PERSON> Zaentz </PERSON>, owner of <ORGANIZATION> Fantasy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Records </ORGANIZATION>, said he was being libeled. In the current case, the two songs are similar in tune and structure, as lawyers for Fantasy demonstrated earlier this week in testimony by musicologists equipped with charts, a piano and a computer sound system that superimposed one pattern of notes on another. A defense musicologist for <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bros. </ORGANIZATION> guided the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> jurors through a series of Creedence records _ `` <LOCATION> Green </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>,'' `` Keep on <PERSON> Chooglin </PERSON>','' `` Tombstone Shadow'' and `` Bootleg'' _ with his own series of elaborate charts pointing out similarities to `` Run Through the Jungle'' and `` Old Man Down the <LOCATION> Road </LOCATION>.'' The six jurors and four alternates, who appeared to range from about 30 to their 60s, listened to the late 1960s-early 1970s medley with serious expressions and varied postures _ one middle-aged man yawned at one point, while several jurors nodded in time to the beat. The defense witness, <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Barlow </PERSON>, who described himself as a `` music plagiarism expert'' as well as a songwriter and arranger, said all the songs had many notes in common. `` He -LRB- <PERSON> Fogerty </PERSON> -RRB- is working with an idea,'' <PERSON> Barlow </PERSON> said. `` The idea is to use B-flat and C in a repetitive structure. ... Mr. <PERSON> Fogerty </PERSON> has made this structure commonplace. The way he uses them, the expression of the idea, they're used differently.'' Under cross-examination, <PERSON> Barlow </PERSON> acknowledged that he had compared the two songs early in the case, without examining any other songs, and concluded they were `` substantially similar,'' the standard that determines copyright infringement. But he insisted that a valid comparison must also take into account earlier works that might have influenced later compositions; in light of those, `` Old Man Down the Road'' ca n't be considered a copy of the 1970 song, <PERSON> Barlow </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Fogerty </PERSON> testified briefly Monday and is scheduled to appear again Friday. In pretrial statements read into the record Wednesday by lawyers for Fantasy, <PERSON> Fogerty </PERSON> said several of his songs, including the two involved in the case, used `` similar phrasing.'' But he added in the statement, `` As far as I'm concerned, the two songs are totally different.''

<TEXT>
 At least 179 people who abandoned a ship sunk by Typhoon Ruby swam or rode lifeboats for hours in mountainous seas to reach safety on small islands, officials said Thursday. The Dona <PERSON> Marilyn </PERSON> sank Monday with more than 500 people aboard. The discovery of survivors on remote islands lifted the hopes of rescue workers, who have found the bodies of at least 32 people. Other reports put the death toll at 26. <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> Go, president of the shipping company that owned the <PERSON> Dona </PERSON> <PERSON> Marilyn </PERSON>, said 138 of the survivors had been put aboard another company vessel and were expected to arrive in <LOCATION> Tacloban </LOCATION> Thursday. Others remained on small islands near where the 2,855-ton <PERSON> Dona </PERSON> <PERSON> Marilyn </PERSON> sank. The vessel was on a Manila-Tacloban run when it sank in heavy seas and high winds about 300 miles southeast of the capital. Go said he hoped more survivors would be found. `` There are plenty of islands in the area,'' and the search was continuing Thursday, he said. Survivors told how people rushed into lifeboats or dived overboard as the vessel heaved in storm-whipped seas and sank. In <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>, people jammed the offices of <ORGANIZATION> Sulpicio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lines </ORGANIZATION>, which owned the ship, seeking information about relatives who were aboard. <PERSON> Virginia </PERSON> <PERSON> Tamban </PERSON>, whose sister and two nieces were passengers, said she would remain overnight to see if their names appeared on the list of survivors. `` I hope they are safe,'' she sobbed. She said none of them knew how to swim. <PERSON> Raymundo </PERSON> <PERSON> Adejer </PERSON>, 27, said his sister, <PERSON> Natividad </PERSON>, and her 4-year-old son were on the vessel, although the boy's name was not on the manifest. `` I can not blame anyone for this except the captain of the ship who still sailed despite reports that a storm was coming up,'' <PERSON> Adejer </PERSON> said. President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> on Wednesday declared a state of calamity in <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> and 35 provinces hardest hit by Typhoon Ruby. The <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> and other relief agencies said 114 people were killed on land by the typhoon, which pummeled the entire archipelago nation with heavy rains and winds Monday and Tuesday before heading west toward <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> said more than 765,000 Filipinos were affected by <PERSON> Ruby </PERSON>, meaning their homes were destroyed, damaged or flooded or sustained other losses. The government said the storm caused $ 45 million in damage to crops and destroyed $ 7.5 million worth of roads and bridges. <PERSON> Bernardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Cabigon </PERSON>, Sulpicio's station manager in <LOCATION> Tacloban </LOCATION>, quoted surviving crewmembers of the <PERSON> Dona </PERSON> <PERSON> Marilyn </PERSON> as saying they briefly tried to pump water from the ship as it listed to one side. `` After they found out they could not do anything anymore, they decided to get off,'' he said. `` Everybody was jumping into the sea. Others took the lifeboats. But there were so many people that they decided to jump and swim. They looked very tired. They stayed in the water for three hours.'' <PERSON> Cabigon </PERSON> quoted survivors as saying that some passengers were so frightened they claimed they saw an island nearby and swam toward it, although the storm had reduced visibility to nearly zero at the time. He quoted survivor <PERSON> Alberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Oledo </PERSON> as saying he jumped overboard with his wife, son and daughter. The three held hands but were separated in the raging seas, and <PERSON> Oledo </PERSON> was the only who reached land. <PERSON> Cabigon </PERSON> said 120 of the 179 survivors managed to reach the remote island of <PERSON> Almagro </PERSON> in lifejackets and life boats. Go said 26 bodies were recovered, but the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> put the figure at 32. There was no explanation for the discrepancy. The <PERSON> Dona </PERSON> <PERSON> Marilyn </PERSON> was trying to maneuver to the western side of <LOCATION> Masbate </LOCATION> island, away from <PERSON> Ruby </PERSON>'s approach to the east, but was buffeted by strong waves and winds of up to 140 mph, <PERSON> Cabigon </PERSON> said. The coast guard said the skipper reported the vessel listing to the port side in heavy seas in a radio distress signal before the ship went down. Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> told reporters she ordered an investigation of the sinking. `` I'm telling -LRB- the transportation minister -RRB- to investigate this and find out why they still sailed during very bad weather.'' Go said he could not explain why the vessel sailed Sunday, despite the approach of the typhoon, because he was unable to interview surviving crew members. In December, another Sulpicio ship, the <LOCATION> Dona </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paz </LOCATION>, collided with an oil tanker off <LOCATION> Mindoro </LOCATION> island. The official death toll was 1,749, but other estimates said more than 3,000 were killed. Only 28 people survived.

The letters will be featured prominently near the entrance of the <ORGANIZATION> Beit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hashoah </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Museum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tolerance </ORGANIZATION> when it opens in 1989 and may also be displayed on world tours, Rabbi <PERSON> Abraham </PERSON> <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON>, the center's associate dean, said Wednesday `` We were pleasantly surprised and honored that we were thought of and were given what we considered a historic opportunity,'' <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> said. The letters `` should not be somewhere in a drawer or a vault.'' The letters, auctioned by <ORGANIZATION> Swann </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Galleries </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> on Tuesday, had been kept for decades by <PERSON> Betty </PERSON> <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> and <PERSON> Juanita </PERSON> <PERSON> Wagner </PERSON>, sisters who corresponded with the <ORGANIZATION> Frank </ORGANIZATION> girls as pen pals just before <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> invaded <LOCATION> The </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION>. The Franks, who were Jewish, hid in an <LOCATION> Amsterdam </LOCATION> attic for two years until they were discovered and sent to concentration camps. <PERSON> Anne </PERSON>, born in 1929, died at <LOCATION> Belsen </LOCATION> in 1945. Her father, <PERSON> Otto </PERSON>, was the family's only survivor. <PERSON> Wiesenthal </PERSON>, a famed Nazi hunter, tracked down and arrested <PERSON> Karl </PERSON> <PERSON> Silberbauer </PERSON>, the Gestapo agent who arrested the <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> family, <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Silberbauer </PERSON> was not convicted of any crime, however, and continued working as a police inspector in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Anne </PERSON>'s poignant diary of life in hiding was published in 1947 and was later made into a play and a movie titled `` The Diary of <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Betty </PERSON> <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> and <PERSON> Juanita </PERSON> <PERSON> Wagner </PERSON> wrote to <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> and <PERSON> Margot </PERSON> <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> in 1940 at the suggestion of a teacher in their hometown, <LOCATION> Danville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>. At the time, <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> and <PERSON> Juanita </PERSON> were 11; <PERSON> Margot </PERSON> and <PERSON> Betty </PERSON> <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> were 15. <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> and <PERSON> Margot </PERSON> sent back two photographs, a postcard and two letters describing their life in <LOCATION> Amsterdam </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Margot </PERSON> wrote that `` having a frontier with <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and being a small country we never feel safe.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Wagners </ORGANIZATION> wrote back, but there was no reply. A month after the letters were sent, <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> invaded <LOCATION> The </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION>. `` We'd worried about her during the war, but never dreamed she was suffering,'' said <PERSON> Betty </PERSON> <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Wagner </PERSON>, reached at her home in the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> area. The letters give insight into <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>'s personality, <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> said. `` It gives a good exposure into the young girl.

 <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Dorr </PERSON>, the ringleader of a white supremacist group that modeled itself on The Order and launched a series of bombings, was sentenced Wednesday to up to 20 years in prison. Two other members of The Order II were sentenced to eight years in prison, but a third defendant was placed on probation. <PERSON> Deborah </PERSON> <PERSON> Dorr </PERSON>, 36, <PERSON> Dorr </PERSON>'s wife, and <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Hawley </PERSON>, 24, were both ordered to jail. <PERSON> Hawley </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Olive </PERSON>, 29, was given a six-year prison sentence, but it was suspended to five years probation. The Dorr-Hawley group, described as `` The Order II'' or `` Bruder Schweigen Task Force'' in documents found in the <LOCATION> Dorr </LOCATION> home, was apparently a small group modeled on the militant white supremacist group The Order. The Order was a violent offshoot of the white supremacist Aryan Nations organization at <LOCATION> Hayden </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION>, which is 30 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Spokane </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION>. Twenty-three members of the original Order were indicted in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> on racketeering charges Twelve pleaded guilty to various charges in the indictment while 10 others were convicted in December 1985. A 23rd person is imprisoned in <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> on other convictions. Prosecutors in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> alleged The Order staged a string of crimes, including bank and armored car robberies, in late 1983 and 1984 in a plot to overthrow the governemnt and establish an Aryan homeland in the Northwest. The Dorrs and Hawleys were indicted by a federal grand jury earlier this year on counts of racketeering, conspiracy, counterfeiting, bombing, illegal possession of automatic weapons and malicious destruction of federal property. They also face separate state charges in the bombings. A trial is tentatively scheduled for early next year. In all but one case, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON> went along with a plea-bargain agreement between the defendants and the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. The defendants all pleaded guilty. Prosecutors recommended up to 12 years for <PERSON> Hawley </PERSON>, but <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON> cut that by a third. `` I think there is hope for you,'' <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON> told <PERSON> Hawley </PERSON>. `` I feel that you have been a follower, and you followed your way into a whole heap of trouble.'' In September 1986, a series of explosions rocked the Coeur d'Alene area in northern <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>. One of the blasts damaged the home of a Roman Catholic priest active in human rights work and another damaged the federal building in <ORGANIZATION> Coeur </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> d'Alene </ORGANIZATION>. There were no injuries. <PERSON> Dorr </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hawley </PERSON> already are serving a four-year sentence in an <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> prison on a federal counterfeiting conviction in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state. <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON> gave them credit for time served since their arrests two years ago. The sentences handed down Wednesday were made concurrent with the previous convictions. Court officials said <PERSON> Dorr </PERSON>, 37, could be eligiible for consideration for parole in four to five years and <PERSON> Hawley </PERSON> in two years. Mrs. <PERSON> Dorr </PERSON> probably will have to serve at least one-third of her eight-year sentence, a defense attorney said.

 Democratic vice presidential candidate <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said Wednesday evening the Republicans had run a `` miserable campaign'' of distortions which <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> did not address until after it hurt the Democratic ticket. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, appearing on the CBS Evening News, said he did not think <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was a racist, but he reiterated his opinion that the ads <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was sanctioning were. `` I think what we have seen is a miserable campaign,'' he said. `` What he's allowing to be done is ... hypocrisy at work,'' he said, complaining that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> allows his advisers to distort the truth. `` Now, he ought to root those things out.'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> cited the Republicans' use of ads showing pictures of <PERSON> Willie </PERSON> <PERSON> Horton </PERSON>, a black <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> prisoner who escaped on furlough and was convicted of raping a white <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> woman. `` In this instance, you've seen how they've used his photograph over and over and over again,'' he said. Asked by <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> anchorman <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Rather </PERSON> if the Democrats were being opportunistic themselves, <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said they were in fact slow to respond. `` <PERSON> Dan </PERSON>, They started immediately after that Democratic convention, and Frankly I thought they should have been answered then,'' he said. `` But my friend <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was incredulous, he just did n't believe that sort of charges with the distortions could stick `` But they have and they have hurt. And that's one of the reasons we're in the kind of a race we're in now.'' Rather asked <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> how often he himself had met with <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said they had participated recently in a joint satellite session with college students. The two men were in separate cities for that event. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> also said he planned to appear with <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> this week. Campaign officials said afterward the event was still tentative because of <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s schedule. On the stump in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, where the <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> broadcast originated, <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> moved on from hitting at <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s campaign advertising and trained his sights again Wednesday at <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s running mate, <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>. `` I think millions of Americans would agree that <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> is not qualified to be president'' if he had to step into the job, <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> told a crowd at a Riverside outdoor plaza. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>'s appearance came hours before he was scheduled to appear on CBS as part of a strategy by the presidential campaign of <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> to get as much television exposure as possible. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> ridiculed the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> campaign for saying <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> would head up a <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration war on drugs and lead the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> space program. As for <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s assertion that he would have a major influence on national defense policy, <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said: `` That's a frightening thought. Are you ready for that?'' There was an enthusiastic response from the noontime crowd. <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> McCurry </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>'s press secretary, said <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> was a bigger issue in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> than in most other states according to the campaign's poll `` We need to keep that issue in front of the voters,'' <PERSON> McCurry </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> arrived in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> after a swing through <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Dakotas </LOCATION>, moving from states with the fewest electoral votes to the one with the most. `` This is the big banana. This is the one we have to win,'' he said. The rally, complete with two high school bands, cheerleaders and balloons was in part a warmup for an unprecedented television blitz by the campaign using <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>. The candidate was taping a five-minute television commercial in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> Wednesday which the Democratic campaign plans to air nationwide on Sunday night. Never has a presidential campaign bought commercial time to feature its vice presidential candidate. The campaign has purchased a five-minute block on the <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> television network on Sunday night. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> will `` be talking about correcting the record, stating the case ... the things he's been talking about so eloquently out on the stump,'' said <PERSON> Tad </PERSON> <PERSON> Devine </PERSON>, who coordinates <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>'s campaign and is a top adviser for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. The Democrats are counting on a major get-out-the-vote effort on Election Day to help carry key states, and it is necessary to keep up enthusiasm in the face of polls showing the ticket trailing, he said. Since <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> was chosen, he has been a consistent asset for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and has proven himself a likeable candidate, <PERSON> Devine </PERSON> said. Since the debate against <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> and especially in the past few days, `` This vice presidential part of the campaign is becoming much more salient,'' he said. In addition to taping the five-minute spot and his appearance on the <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Evening </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> plans to make additional footage that could be used in commercials in the final week of the race. A joint commercial spot with <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> also was possible before Election Day, <PERSON> Devine </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>'s appearance with <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Rather </PERSON> demonstrated to voters that he was capable of meeting with the press and public and his Republican counterpart was not, <PERSON> Devine </PERSON> said. `` Let's face it, the Republicans would n't dream of putting <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> on a set with <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Rather </PERSON> or anybody else,'' he said.

 <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s former minister of culture has been denied a visa to go on a speaking tour of universities around the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday. <PERSON> Frances </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, a department spokeswoman, said <PERSON> Ernesto </PERSON> <PERSON> Cardinale </PERSON>'s request for a visa was rejected under two sections of the Immigration and Naturalization Act One section prohibits foreigners from receiving a visa if they had previously obtained one under false pretenses; another bars anyone who has been associated with the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> from obtaining a visa. <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> said she did not know specifically why <PERSON> Cardinale </PERSON>'s request for a visa was turned down. `` I do n't have details on this and I do n't know the particulars,'' she said. But she said the department's decision was unrelated to a proclamation signed Tuesday by President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will no longer grant entry visas to officials of <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s leftist Sandinista government because such visits were `` detrimental to the interests of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.'' The proclamation was partly in retaliation for new restrictions placed on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government officials in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> last month. Relations between the two countries have been particularly strained since last July 11 when <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION> expelled the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> ambassador, and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> retaliated. The Sandinista party newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Barricada </ORGANIZATION>, in its Wednesday editions, ran a last page story under the headline: `` The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Declares Visa War.'' The article charged that the denial of official visas was linked to `` an old plan by the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> to try to isolate <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Cardinale </PERSON>'s original itinerary called for him to speak universities around the country in late October and early November. Last month, <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> McAllister </PERSON>, associate dean of <ORGANIZATION> Northeastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> in </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION>, wrote Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Kerry </PERSON>, D-Mass., asking him to `` exert some pressure'' to encourage the issuance of <PERSON> Cardinale </PERSON>'s visa so the Nicaraguan could speak on Nov. <PERSON> McAllister </PERSON> said he was disturbed about the delay in the visa process. `` Mr. <PERSON> Cardinale </PERSON> is a well-known figure who has been to this country before and for whom the process of a visa can not be difficult, time-consuming or labor-intensive,'' the dean wrote.

<HEAD>University Transplant Surgeon Sues News Sources</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A heart-lung transplant surgeon at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Minnesota </ORGANIZATION> filed a defamation lawsuit against a newspaper's unidentified sources who said he ordered an operation on a patient already considered dead. The suit, filed Tuesday in <ORGANIZATION> Hennepin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, centers on a story that appeared in the <ORGANIZATION> Star </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION> Aug. 2. The story said the university was investigating an allegation that Dr. <PERSON> Stuart </PERSON> <PERSON> Jamieson </PERSON> ordered an associate to perform a bypass operation on a patient who was considered dead before the surgery began. Two days later, in a front page note to readers, the newspaper said it regretted having published the account because the sources for it did not have firsthand information. The suit is designed to enable <PERSON> Jamieson </PERSON>'s attorneys to serve subpoenas and take sworn statements from people at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Minnesota </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> who may be the sources or know who they are. The surgeon on the case, Dr. <PERSON> Jolene </PERSON> <PERSON> Kriett </PERSON>, has said the Aug. 2 report was wrong. She said <PERSON> Jamieson </PERSON> had not ordered the operation, that it was not bypass surgery but the installation of a left ventricular assist device to help the patient's failing heart and that the patient was alive when she operated. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Forsythe </PERSON>, a spokesman for <PERSON> Jamieson </PERSON>'s lawyer <PERSON> Terence </PERSON> <PERSON> Fruth </PERSON>, said Tuesday that if attorneys learn the identity of the sources they would be named publicly as defendants in the suit. The suit alleges that the sources `` have and continue to cause great damage'' to <PERSON> Jamieson </PERSON>'s reputation.

<HEAD>Amish Go To Court Over Requirement to Display Signs on Buggies</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PRESTON, Minn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Requiring Amish people to display slow-moving vehicle signs on their horse-drawn buggies desecrates their religion, an attorney argued Wednesday in asking a judge to dismiss citations against 15 defendants. The 15 were cited for failure to obey a state law requiring them to display the triangular warning signs on the rear of their buggies. In the dark or fog, the signs must be reflective orange, and the Amish shun bright colors. Attorney <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Villaume </PERSON> of <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> Fillmore </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Clement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Snyder </ORGANIZATION> that the Amish recognize the state's interest in safety on public roadways and are willing to use reflective tape and lanterns Prosecutor <PERSON> Matt </PERSON> <PERSON> Opat </PERSON> has said the public safety issues outweigh any infringement the law may have on the defendants' constitutional right of religious freedom. <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Zook </PERSON>, 42, a professor at <ORGANIZATION> Luther </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Decorah </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, testified as an expert on the Amish that slow-moving vehicle signs are an `` intrusion into their life. This has nothing to do with being symbolic of being God's people,'' which the Amish believe they are, <PERSON> Zook </PERSON> said. Amish are opposed to bright colors because they draw attention to themselves, <PERSON> Zook </PERSON> said. He said they put their trust in God and that they know traveling on the highway with a horse and buggy is somewhat dangerous. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> has interpreted the First Amendment to mean that sincerely held religious beliefs may not be infringed upon by the state unless the limitation is the least restrictive means to achieve a `` compelling state interest.'' A ruling in the case is not expected for at least one month.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> sent a report to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday outlining plans to reduce air-traffic controller errors at <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>'s O'Hare International Airport, but <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION>' two senators said it fell short of expectations. The six-page document sent to Sen. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, D-Ill., for relay to other lawmakers contained few details and set no timetable for implementating <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> proposals Among them were the hiring of an unspecified number of former <LOCATION> O'Hare </LOCATION> controllers to ease a staff shortage, a pay incentive to increase the size of the tower staff, and the expansion of controller facilities. `` We have a big problem at <LOCATION> O'Hare </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> said. `` What we wanted was an action plan. What we got was a wish list.'' Sen. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON>, D-Ill., issued a statement calling the report `` inadequate. `` This does n't begin to address the problem,'' <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON> has proposed the re-hiring of some of the controllers who were fired in a 1981 strike. He said <LOCATION> O'Hare </LOCATION> needs 37 more controllers to bring its total to 72, but the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> report calls for the addition of only five. <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON> also said the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> report made no mention of limits on the number of flights going into and out of <LOCATION> O'Hare </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> passed a resolution earlier this month instructing the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> to inform <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> by Oct. 25 of its immediate and long-term goals to improve operations blamed for a surge of controller errors at <LOCATION> O'Hare </LOCATION>, the nation's busiest airport. Its controllers have had 30 such mistakes this year, compared with 12 during all of 1987 and their previous record of 22 in 1986, the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> said. The report, which was approved Tuesday by <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Burnley </PERSON> and presented to <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> a day after the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> deadline, promised action to improve operations at <LOCATION> O'Hare </LOCATION> in five broad categories: staffing and training, facilities and equipment, communications, airspace, and safety and efficiency on the ground. To address a manpower shortage, the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> cited two steps that officials already have decided to take. Five controllers are being relieved of training responsibilities and returned to regular traffic handling at the facility, and the agency has begun assigning personnel with experience at <LOCATION> O'Hare </LOCATION> on a temporary basis until more fully trained controllers can be added to the staff. It also said it hopes to adopt the pay incentive program and intends to establish a recruiting program as well as look into the possibility of `` sectorizing positions of operation'' so controllers need to be trained at fewer operating stations. `` This review, as others, has identified numerous equipment and physical plant improvements that could be made in order to improve the efficient operation at <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> tower,'' the report said. `` Many of these can be made in the short term.'' For example, the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> has leased a television-type weather monitor for the <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> tower while the agency waits for acquisition of similar units throughout the air-traffic control system. The agency also cited several steps to make communications between pilots, controllers, airlines and technicians more efficient _ such as reassessing the distribution of hand-held two-way radios and limiting radio conversations. The recommendations essentially summarized 80 proposals the agency had made earlier to improve operations at <LOCATION> O'Hare </LOCATION> and broke no new ground, said <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>'s press secretary, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Carle </PERSON>. `` Not only was <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> disappointed with the lack of a timetable, but he felt the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> should have addressed other problems, like flight delays,'' <PERSON> Carle </PERSON> said. `` He said that demonstrates the agency still does n't recognize that the status quo is unacceptable.''

<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> ambassador to the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday that if Iran-Iraq peace talks break down over the Shatt-al-Arab waterway, <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> will reopen a new deep-water port just west of the Shatt. Ambassador <PERSON> Ismat </PERSON> <PERSON> Kittani </PERSON> said the port at <PERSON> Khor </PERSON> <PERSON> Zouber </PERSON> was productive before war broke out in September 1980 and could be restored if <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> is unwilling to guarantee free navigation on the Shatt-al-Arab and agree to its being dredged. He spoke with reporters at his home Wednesday night just before returning to <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION> for consultations. The peace talks resume in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> on Monday. <PERSON> Khor </PERSON> <PERSON> Zouber </PERSON> is reached by turning west just before entering the <LOCATION> Shatt-al-Arab </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Kittani </PERSON> said, and entering the <PERSON> Khor </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdallah </PERSON> channel, which empties into the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>. The <PERSON> Shatt </PERSON> was <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s main outlet to the gulf before the war, but has been blocked by sunken ships, unexploded ordnance and silt that has accumulated since the war began in September 1980. Asked if <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> wanted to develop an alternative deep-water port, <PERSON> Kittani </PERSON> replied, `` We'll have to'' if the Iranians wo n't agree to begin the dredging and reopening of the <PERSON> Shatt </PERSON>, known to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> as the <LOCATION> Arvand </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>. `` We certainly can do without <LOCATION> Basra </LOCATION>'' if necessary, said <PERSON> Kittani </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Basra </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s major port city on the <PERSON> Shatt </PERSON>, was heavily shelled in the war. The envoy noted that before the war, `` at least 85 percent of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s imports came to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> through the Shatt, to <LOCATION> Khorramshar </LOCATION>'' on the east bank of the passage. <PERSON> Kittani </PERSON> said regarding rights to the Shatt: `` Each is on his side -LRB- of the passage -RRB-. We will decide the sovereignty of running water later -LRB- in the peace talks -RRB-.'' `` Whatever agreement is signed on the <PERSON> Shatt </PERSON>, both countries will be able to use it,'' with specific rights to be worked out, said <PERSON> Kittani </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> insists the 1975 <ORGANIZATION> Algiers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION>, which defines their border as running down the middle of the Shatt, must be maintained. President <PERSON> Saddam </PERSON> <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> rejected the treaty in 1980. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> distrusts <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s commitment to a true peace settlement, and diplomats have said it appears <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> may want to gain sovereignty over the entire <PERSON> Shatt </PERSON> to guarantee its freedom of navigation.

 Hustler magazine publisher <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Flynt </PERSON> offered a hitman $ 1 million to kill <ORGANIZATION> Playboy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> magazine </ORGANIZATION> founder <PERSON> Hugh </PERSON> <PERSON> Hefner </PERSON>, <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Sinatra </PERSON>, publisher <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Annenberg </PERSON> and Penthouse publisher <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Guccione </PERSON>, authorities said Wednesday. The $ 1 million never was paid, however, and the purported hitman, <PERSON> Mitchel </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> WerBell </PERSON>, died of a heart attack in December 1983 about a month after he allegedly accepted the check from <PERSON> Flynt </PERSON>, sheriff's Capt <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Grimm </PERSON> said at a news conference. <PERSON> Grimm </PERSON> identified targets of the alleged plot as <PERSON> Hefner </PERSON>, <PERSON> Sinatra </PERSON> and <PERSON> Guccione </PERSON>. He declined to name a fourth person targeted, but <ORGANIZATION> KNBC-TV </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> news </ORGANIZATION> reported that person was <LOCATION> Annenberg </LOCATION>. `` <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Flynt </PERSON> one evening called an individual by the name of <PERSON> WerBell </PERSON> to his home and allegedly offered him $ 1 million if he would arrange for the death of these four individuals,'' Sheriff <PERSON> Sherman </PERSON> <PERSON> Block </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> KNBC </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> WerBell </PERSON> called himself an advisor to the Green Berets in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> and a retired general of the <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Free </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Afghan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, according to promotional material from his counterterrorism firm, <ORGANIZATION> Sionics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, released by the Sheriff's <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. `` He did in fact give WerBell a $ 1 million check which, immediately upon leaving, we were told, that <PERSON> Flynt </PERSON>'s business manager stopped payment on that check so it never was negotiated,'' the sheriff of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> said in the broadcast interview. The station displayed a photocopy of a $ 1 million check allegedly signed by <PERSON> Flynt </PERSON>, made out to <PERSON> WerBell </PERSON>. <PERSON> Grimm </PERSON> said information about the alleged plot turned up recently in the investigation the 1983 murder-for-hire slaying of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> theater producer <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Radin </PERSON>, whom authorities said was embroiled in a soured finance deal for the movie `` The <ORGANIZATION> Cotton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>.'' <PERSON> Grimm </PERSON> said sheriff's investigators have not interviewed <PERSON> Flynt </PERSON> and have not presented a case to the district attorney's office. He declined to elaborate and said the sheriff spoke about the purported plot because he was approached by the news media and decided to answer questions about it. In 1983, <PERSON> Flynt </PERSON> claimed to have knowledge of videotapes purportedly showing <PERSON> Vicki </PERSON> <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON>, mistress of the late <ORGANIZATION> Diners </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> founder <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Bloomingdales </PERSON> engaged in sexual antics with <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration officials. The tapes were never produced or proven to exist. Another time that year, <PERSON> Flynt </PERSON> threatened to parachute over the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> at the site where <ORGANIZATION> Korean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lines </ORGANIZATION> Flight 007 was shot down by a Soviet interceptor. At the time, <PERSON> Flynt </PERSON> was heavily sedated with powerful drugs to assuage pain from wounds that left him paralyzed after an assassination attempt in 1978 during an obscenity trial in <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>. Block told <ORGANIZATION> KNBC </ORGANIZATION> that <PERSON> Flynt </PERSON> could possibly be prosecuted for soliciting a murder. However, no charges have been filed. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Farley </PERSON>, director of communications for <ORGANIZATION> Playboy </ORGANIZATION>, said the plot occurred in November 1983 and came to light in the course of an investigation into another matter. <PERSON> Farley </PERSON> said his information came from the Sheriff's <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, but he did not know what the other matter was. <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON>, publicist for <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Sinatra </PERSON>, said the entertainer was en route to <PERSON> Reno </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Nev. </LOCATION>, for performances and she was n't able to contact him. She said she would leave a message at the hotel, asking him to call. A telephone call placed to Penthouse magazine headquarters in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> was answered by a security guard who said no one representing the magazine was available for comment. A telephone call placed to <PERSON> Annenberg </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> Palm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION> home was answered by a woman who said he was in residence on the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> and would n't be immediately available for comment. She declined to disclose her relationship to <LOCATION> Annenberg </LOCATION> or what city he was living in. She took a message and said she would forward it to <PERSON> Annenberg </PERSON>. After hours calls made to <PERSON> Annenberg </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Triangle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Publications </ORGANIZATION>, in <LOCATION> Radnor </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, went unanswered. <PERSON> Block </PERSON> said he considered the matter serious. `` I've been led to believe that <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Flynt </PERSON> has a propensity to try to harm people he sees as his enemies, whether business arrangements or whatever,'' <PERSON> Block </PERSON> said. A receptionist at <PERSON> Flynt </PERSON>'s office did n't know where the publisher and said she was unaware of the report on the alleged murder plot. Although the broadcast report suggested a publishing rivalry between the men's magazine publishers, <PERSON> Farley </PERSON> said the other names suggested that was not the case and that the motivation is unknown. `` Why the authorities chose to release <PERSON> Hugh </PERSON> <PERSON> Hefner </PERSON>'s name and not anybody else's is a mystery to me,'' <PERSON> Farley </PERSON> said.

 The vice president of <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION> questioned the safety of the state airline on Wednesday and urged that it be reorganized, a day after 12 people died in the fiery crash of an Aeroperu jetliner. A Swiss priest and four other Europeans were among those killed. Fifty-seven people survived, many with serious injuries, when the twin-jet Fokker-28 crashed immediately after taking off from the airport in <LOCATION> Juliaca </LOCATION>, more than 12,000 feet above sea level in the Andes mountains. <PERSON> Aeroperu </PERSON> said six Americans and nine other foreigners were among 44 people with significant injuries. The other survivors received minor bruises. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> said Aeroperu earlier mistakenly identified one of the dead as an American. The <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> said the man, <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>, was a 53-year-old Briton living in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Areoperu </PERSON> said a passenger earlier listed as unaccounted for was a Peruvian, who survived without major injuries. The company also issued a communique late Wednesday, responding to mounting criticism since the crash. `` The plane was in proper operating condition, fulfilling strictly the maintenance regulations stipulated by the manufacturer,'' the communique said. However, Vice President <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Alberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanchez </PERSON> said in a radio interview, `` Aeroperu needed and still needs substantial reform. New planes are needed ... But, above all, they must be functioning in a constant state of repair.'' The Pilots' Association of Aeroperu had charged that the airline's fleet of 10 planes was in poor shape because of a shortage of spare parts and lack of maintenance. The union struck briefly two months ago over the issue. <PERSON> Aeroperu </PERSON> said the foreigners aboard the Dutch-made craft when it crashed were mainly tourists returning from a visit to nearby <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Titicaca </LOCATION>. Flight 771 was bound for <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION>, 540 miles to the northwest, with a stop in <LOCATION> Arequipa </LOCATION>. Survivors and witnesses on the ground said an explosion rocked the plane seconds after takeoff. The plane crashed by the <LOCATION> Cabanillas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, a mile from the airport. Many victims died from burns suffered after the plane split in three pieces on impact and the tail section burst into flames, officials said. Transportation Minister <PERSON> Camilo </PERSON> <PERSON> Carrillo </PERSON> said the pilot averted a greater disaster by steering the jet toward a sandy flood plain, which softened the impact. Officials gave no cause for the accident. They said an investigation was under way. Besides <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>, <PERSON> Aeroperu </PERSON> identified the European dead as the Rev. <PERSON> Kurt </PERSON> <PERSON> Lenz </PERSON>, a Roman Catholic priest from <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION> who worked near <LOCATION> Juliaca </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ingeborg </PERSON> <PERSON> Pfiller </PERSON>, a married couple from <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>; and <PERSON> Bruno </PERSON> <PERSON> Baldazari </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>. It listed six Americans, three Spaniards, two Italians, two French, one Briton and one Brazilian among the injured. Prior to Tuesday's crash, the last major air accident here occurred Dec. 9 when a twin-engine <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fokker </ORGANIZATION> F-27 crashed off <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> coast, killing 44 people, including nearly the entire squad of <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>'s No. 1 soccer team <ORGANIZATION> Alianza </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lima </ORGANIZATION>.

 An 8-year-old girl allegedly beaten to death at an <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> farm while other children watched and counted the blows was laid to rest Wednesday, with a plea from her uncle to `` learn to love another better.'' <PERSON> Dayna </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorea </PERSON> <PERSON> Broussard </PERSON> died Oct. 14 at the home used by <ORGANIZATION> Ecclesia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Athletic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, a group founded by her father, <PERSON> Eldridge </PERSON> <PERSON> Broussard </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> purportedly to train ghetto youngsters to be world-class athletes and entertainers. The girl was beaten and whipped by members of the group, authorities alleged. Four people were charged with manslaughter. <PERSON> Broussard </PERSON> was not among the 150 family members and friends who filled the Angelus Funeral Home, where the little girl lay in an open pink casket. `` Little <PERSON> Dayna </PERSON> is in the arms of <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> now,'' said the Rev. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Bereal </PERSON>, pastor of <ORGANIZATION> Calvary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bible </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Compton </ORGANIZATION>. `` She's safe Amen.'' `` We're the ones who are left behind,'' he said. `` We're the ones who are still struggling.'' In his eulogy, <PERSON> Bereal </PERSON> asked mourners to trust in God with the simplicity of a child. `` Adults have a tendency to be proud,'' <PERSON> Bereal </PERSON> said. `` A child will willingly go, saying, ` I trust you. I humble myself to you.''' The girl's uncle, <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Webb </PERSON>, told mourners: `` This is an experience that we've never experienced before. Through this experience may we learn to love one another better and to experience life more.'' The girl's cousin, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Bereal </PERSON>, who acted as a pallbearer, said most members of the family were deeply troubled by <PERSON> Broussard </PERSON>'s actions `` It's a cult,'' said <PERSON> Bereal </PERSON>, `` I hope the authorities break all that stuff up. It's all <PERSON> El </PERSON> <PERSON> Broussard </PERSON> _ he's the whole problem.'' Meanwhile in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, a misdemeanor complaint alleging child endangerment and inflicting illegal corporal punishment was filed Wednesday against <PERSON> Alvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Elvis </PERSON> <PERSON> Broussard </PERSON>, the 25-year-old brother of <PERSON> Eldridge </PERSON> <PERSON> Broussard </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr </PERSON>. The complaint stemmed from a police visit to the <ORGANIZATION> Watts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> on Oct. 16, prompted by news reports of <PERSON> Dayna </PERSON>'s death in <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Qualls </PERSON>, a spokesman for City Attorney <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON>. `` While the officers were at the center, they noticed that a 10-year-old boy had bruises on his head and chest,'' <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON> said in a prepared statement. `` They questioned him about his injuries and he told them <PERSON> Alvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Broussard </PERSON> had struck him with a rubber hose and a closed fist.'' <PERSON> Alvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Broussard </PERSON> initially was booked for investigation of felony child endangerment, but the case subsequently was referred to <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON>'s office for misdemeanor prosecution, said Deputy City Attorney <PERSON> Alice </PERSON> <PERSON> Hand </PERSON> In <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>, authorities said the children, who were kept in a sparsely furnished, four-bedroom farmhouse, were subjected to ritualistic beatings of up to 800 strokes with a paddle or electrical cord. In some cases, including the beating death of <PERSON> Dayna </PERSON>, children were forced to watch and keep count, authorities said. The beatings were intended to enhance athletic performance, not to punish misbehavior, authorities have said. The children, mostly from the impoverished Watts section of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, were kept in the farmhouse near <LOCATION> Sandy </LOCATION>, about 30 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>. The state of <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> has taken 53 children into protective custody from the farm. Two other children involved in the group are in custody in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Eldridge </PERSON> <PERSON> Broussard </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> has denied that the children were beaten or abused, saying they were only `` spanked.'' The four suspects in the girl's death, all of whom have pleaded innocent to first-degree manslaughter charges, remained in custody Wednesday after defense lawyers asked that scheduled release hearings be delayed. A defense lawyer said the attorneys have n't had enough time to review investigative reports in the case.

Earlier, <PERSON> Rafeedie </PERSON> sentenced a co-defendant, <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> <PERSON> Felix </PERSON> <PERSON> Gutierrez </PERSON>, to 10 years in prison following his conviction as an accessory after the fact. <PERSON> Felix </PERSON>, 38, was convicted of helping Mexican drug lord <PERSON> Rafael </PERSON> <PERSON> Caro </PERSON> <PERSON> Quintero </PERSON> escape to <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION> following the 1985 torture-murder of <PERSON> Enrique </PERSON> <PERSON> Camarena </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> agent. <PERSON> Camarena </PERSON> had been investigating <PERSON> Caro </PERSON>'s drug smuggling empire in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> when he was kidnapped outside the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> consulate in <LOCATION> Guadalajara </LOCATION> on Feb. 7, 1985. <PERSON> Camarena </PERSON>'s battered body was found, along with the body of his pilot, in a shallow grave at a remote ranch 65 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Guadalajara </LOCATION> on March 5, 1985. <PERSON> Verdugo </PERSON> declared through an interpreter: `` You are judging an innocent person. That's all I have to say.'' His attorney, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Pancer </PERSON>, also argued passionately before sentencing that the jury verdict was wrong. `` This is the most difficult moment I've had in court in 20 years,'' the attorney said. `` I know it's important for counsel to accept the verdict, but your honor, I ca n't do that. `` The verdict was not correct, because Mr. <PERSON> Verdugo </PERSON> is innocent of wrongdoing in this case,'' <PERSON> Pancer </PERSON> said. The prosecutor, Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Gurule </PERSON>, told the judge that the jury was right and he urged the judge to send a powerful message to drug traffickers by imposing a stiff sentence. <PERSON> Verdugo </PERSON> was typical of a band of `` narco-terrorists'' who are `` attacking the foundation and fabric of society,'' <PERSON> Gurule </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Rafeedie </PERSON> rejected the prosecutor's request for a 900-year sentence, and instead imposed four consecutive 60-year terms on four of the counts and a single life imprisonment sentence on another charge. `` The fact of the matter is the evidence is conclusive and undisputed,'' <PERSON> Rafeedie </PERSON> said, `` that on the date that the murder and torture was taking place that -LRB- <LOCATION> Verdugo </LOCATION> -RRB- was at that house.'' He added, `` There is enough here on the part of the jury to find participation on the part of Mr. Verdugo.'' Earlier, <PERSON> Rafeedie </PERSON> ordered that <PERSON> Felix </PERSON> serve his 10-year sentence after his current 15-year term for marijuana trafficking. <PERSON> Felix </PERSON>'s lawyer, <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Tarlow </PERSON>, had argued that his client's role was minor and that he was far less important in the overall scheme of <PERSON> Camarena </PERSON>'s murder than two co-defendants also convicted in the <PERSON> Camarena </PERSON> case. The third defendant, <PERSON> Raul </PERSON> <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON> <PERSON> Alvarez </PERSON>, is to be sentenced Friday.

<HEAD>Holocaust Memorial Desecrated With Swastikas, ``No Remorse'' Slogan</HEAD>

 Swastikas and the words `` No Remorse'' were discovered Wednesday painted on a prominent Holocaust memorial containing ashes of Jews who died in the <LOCATION> Auschwitz </LOCATION> concentration camp. The desecration of the monument with anti-Semitic graffiti stunned members of the Jewish community, who said the words written on the 11-year-old memorial demonstrated that whoever committed the vandalism fully understood the significance of the site. `` I was absolutely distraught. It was as if the seas of Nazism were once again flourishing,'' said <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Spiegel </PERSON>, executive vice president of the <ORGANIZATION> Jewish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Haven </ORGANIZATION>. The vandalism was the first incident of desecration to the memorial since someone tried to burn down six yew bushes at the site 10 years ago, <PERSON> Spiegel </PERSON> said. The memorial is located in a small park situated along a major city artery. <PERSON> Spiegel </PERSON> summoned police to the site after being alerted early Wednesday morning of the vandalism. Two swastikas were spray-painted on the monument's brass plaques, and the words `` No Remorse'' and `` White Power'' were written on the concrete base, <PERSON> Spiegel </PERSON> said. The brass monument depicts the barbed wire fences of the Nazi concentration camps. A statement dedicating the memorial to the six million Jews who died in the Holocaust is written in English, Yiddish and Hebrew. Ashes recovered from the <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> concentration camp in <LOCATION> Auschwitz </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, were re-interred in the base of the memorial, and local Holocaust survivors who have `` no other cemetery to go to'' visit it to say prayers for family members and friends who perished in the war, <PERSON> Spiegel </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Spiegel </PERSON> said the use of the slogan `` No Remorse'' indicated to him that an adult was responsible for the desecration. `` Youngsters do n't use the word ` remorse.' That is not in a child's vocabulary,'' he said. City police Major <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Muller </PERSON> said an investigation was continuing, and that police could not yet say whether the act was the work of a youngster or an adult. The swastikas and slogans were all removed, with the only lasting damage occurring to the brass plates, <PERSON> Spiegel </PERSON> said. The memorial, designed by a <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> architect who accepted no payment for his services, was erected in 1977. Plaques recognizing the role of `` righteous gentiles'' who helped Jews during the war and servicemen who fought the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION> were added to the memorial site. The monument was the first of its kind in the country built jointly by a municipality and a Jewish organization, he said. About 300 of the estimated 25,000 Jews living in the New Haven area are Holocaust survivors, according to the Jewish Federation.

 National public employees struck on Wednesday for the first time in Honduran history, and President <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Azcona </PERSON> <PERSON> Huyo </PERSON> ordered soldiers posted in front of government buildings. The approximately 60,000 strikers, including teachers, hospital employees and transportation workers, demand pay increases of about 10 percent. Their average monthly salary now is about $ 500. They also want the government to resume severance payments. In the past two years, the government has fired about 5,000 employees. Union officials said the dismissals appear politically motivated and are continuing. Striking hospital workers said they would handle only emergency cases. The government said employees who do not show up at work Thursday will not be paid. Sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> probably will declare the strike illegal. The strike began at 7 a.m. and kept <PERSON> Azcona </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoyo </PERSON> in an emergency Cabinet meeting most of the day. <PERSON> Obdulio </PERSON> <PERSON> Chevez </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Employees </ORGANIZATION>, said the strike will continue until the government agrees to salary and job stability demands.

 Guidelines issued today by the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Obstetricians </ORGANIZATION> and Gynecologists say women who have had babies delivered by Caesarean section should be encouraged to have later children by normal, vaginal birth.

 The turnout in the presidential election is expected to be one of the lowest this century, continuing a trend of declining voter participation in a nation that prides itself as a beacon of Western democracy, say political analysts. Public interest groups are warning that only 50 percent or less of the eligible voters will go to the polls on Nov. 8, about the same as the record low 49 percent turnout in the 1924 presidential election.

 The staggering new corporate debt burdens proposed in the wave of multibillion-dollar leveraged buyout bids could force companies to make big layoffs and reduce employee benefits to cover debt payments, critics say.

 <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Lauria </PERSON> believes that one reason he works so much as an actor is that few people in the film business look at old movies. He plays the overworked father on <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` The Wonder Years'' and has had recurring roles on two other series. He was in the movie `` Stakeout'' and played <PERSON> Bernadette </PERSON> <PERSON> Peters </PERSON>' boyfriend in the TV movie `` <PERSON> David </PERSON>.'' This Saturday, he plays the veteran police sergeant in `` Cop Killer,'' the first installment of the remake of the anthology series `` Police Story'' on <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>. `` People do n't watch the old movies,'' said <PERSON> Lauria </PERSON>. `` Nobody knows <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Conte </PERSON>. I go in for a part and do my <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Conte </PERSON> or <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Heflin </PERSON>. Nobody knows I'm stealing. I steal from the best and I do n't feel bad about it.'' <PERSON> Lauria </PERSON> appears with <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Olin </PERSON> and <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> Wettig </PERSON>, the husband-and-wife stars of <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` thirtysomething,'' in the premiere episode of `` Police Story.'' <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> revived `` Police Story'' last summer during the writers' strike when it appeared the networks would not have new shows ready for the fall season The series, created by author <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Wambaugh </PERSON>, ran on <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> from 1973-77. <PERSON> Lauria </PERSON>'s role was originally played by <PERSON> Cameron </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>. `` I'm the veteran police sergeant,'' said <PERSON> Lauria </PERSON>. `` <PERSON> Kenny </PERSON> <PERSON> Olin </PERSON> is the young stud cop. <PERSON> Olin </PERSON>'s partner is taken hostage during a traffic stop. They're bank robbers and it turns into a firefight. His partner is killed and <PERSON> Kenny </PERSON> kills a bank robber and gets a medal. Even though he did everything by the book, <PERSON> Kenny </PERSON> goes through a psychological change. `` I loved working with <PERSON> Kenny </PERSON>. He did n't walk through it. We talked over the characters, which is rare for television. This is more of a drama about what happens to this man than an action picture.'' <PERSON> Lauria </PERSON> grew up watching old movies, and still watches them regularly from his large collection of tapes. His ambition is to work with <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON>. `` I grew up in <LOCATION> Lindenhurst </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, and my aunt lived with us when I was young,'' he said. `` I was a big jock in school. When I got home from practice I'd eat dinner and my aunt would send me straight to bed. Then, she'd wake me in the middle of the night. She'd say, ` <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Cagney </PERSON>.' Or ` <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON>,' or ` <PERSON> Tyrone </PERSON> <PERSON> Power </PERSON>.' I'd get up and watch the most wonderful movies. `` When the networks decided to revive some old shows during the writers' strike I do n't know why they went back to the 1970s. They should have gone back to the 1950s and redone those great live dramas. I can think of a lot of shows that stand up pretty well today.'' <PERSON> Lauria </PERSON> began acting at <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Connecticut </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, which he attended on a football scholarship.

So, if a question comes up, they look at me like the old guard. The real stars of this show are the scripts. They are so wonderful. `` I did n't want to do the part at first. They offered me more money. I said it was n't the money. Then <PERSON> Carol </PERSON> cried. I said, ` Wait, a producer who cries?' The reason I said no was that I figured it would last for eight years.

<TEXT>
 In a darkened classroom, a slide projector beams a photograph of a bend in the <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Marys </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> where crosscurrents have fooled some of the most experienced Great Lakes freighter pilots. The students studying the narrow river stretch make mental notes for the day they will steer a hulking 700-foot lake freighter through the same winding passage. For cadets at the Great Lakes Maritime Academy, such training in current navigational technology is combined with the guidance of experienced sailors. `` It's much better training than you can get on a ship because we can simulate near-collisions or running aground,'' said Rear Adm. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> McNulty </PERSON>, superintendent of the academy, which is part of <ORGANIZATION> Northwestern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Michigan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>. Graduates of the three-year deck officer program can be licensed to pilot commercial vessels, starting at $ 18,000 to $ 20,000 a year. Does the reality of life on the high seas match the adventure and glamor of Great Lakes folklore? `` I would n't recommend it for anyone who does n't like getting dirty or who needs to see a movie every night or who likes to run out to the store,'' said graduate <PERSON> Candace </PERSON> <PERSON> Peterson </PERSON>, 30, of Two Harbors, <LOCATION> Minn. </LOCATION>, one of few women working on the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> fleet on the Great Lakes. `` There's no glamour in it at all. But it's wonderful going home, knowing you've made a good wage and have choices of what to do with your money,'' said <PERSON> Peterson </PERSON>, third assistant engineer on the <ORGANIZATION> USX </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s fleet. She expects to make $ 30,000 to $ 40,000 this shipping season. New graduates typically work as relief help for vacationing sailors or those who take advantage of their 30 days shore leave for each 90 days worked, <PERSON> McNulty </PERSON> said. In his first job after graduating in 1985, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Basile </PERSON> piloted a tour boat around <LOCATION> Escanaba </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>, for $ 8 an hour. The following two years, he worked as a fill-in deck hand, making $ 20,000 to $ 25,000 each year. `` I've loved the water all my life and wanted to have something to do with it,'' said <PERSON> Basile </PERSON>, who now sails lake freighters with Inland Lakes Management of <LOCATION> Alpena </LOCATION>. `` I wanted to make a lot of money and I did n't want to spend a lot of time in college.'' <PERSON> McNulty </PERSON> has been speaking to the Elks, Optimists and <ORGANIZATION> Kiwanis </ORGANIZATION> clubs, trying to recruit students from <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Milwaukee </LOCATION> and throughout <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>. The task is n't easy. `` In the early 1980s, the opportunities for graduates were not good and the news was widespread,'' he said. Great Lakes shipping slumped in the early 1980s due mostly to a slipping demand for steel. The 1987 season was brisk, and through August of this year, the most recent figures available, shipments of iron ore, coal and stone were up 13.5 percent over the same eight-month period last year, said <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> <PERSON> Nekvasil </PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Lake </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carriers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. By 1991, at least 71 pilots and 69 engineers will be needed by the 14 shipping companies that comprise the <ORGANIZATION> Lake </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carriers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> to fill vacancies created by retirement, the Cleveland-based association says. <PERSON> McNulty </PERSON>, an ebullient 58-year-old Irishman who earned the rank of rear admiral in the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> before retiring, became director of the academy in 1984. Enrollment is 57 students this year; its high was 210 in 1981. Among the school's benefactors is Canadian balladeer <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> Lightfoot </PERSON>, who underwrites a $ 5,000 annual scholarship. His donation came after one of the school's cadets died in the sinking of the <PERSON> Edmund </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzgerald </PERSON> on <ORGANIZATION> Lake </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> in November 1975, the subject of a hit song by <PERSON> Lightfoot </PERSON>. The academy is one of six regional state-run facilities in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. It is considered quasi-military, but except for requiring cadets to wear khaki-colored pants and shirts and black shoes, military rules are absent, <PERSON> McNulty </PERSON> said. The school offers two programs. One trains cadets to become deck officers who can eventually pilot the Great Lakes freighters that primarily haul iron ore, stone and coal. The second program trains cadets to maintain equipment on the commercial vessels. Subjects include naval science, nautical rules, ship construction and ship stability and ship handling. Both programs lead to an associate of applied science degree. The three-year programs include nine months of training on a commercial freighter. That's when many students learn whether life on the seas is for them. `` A lot of youngsters decide they want to become sailors after reading some romantic novel,'' <PERSON> McNulty </PERSON> said. `` It's not all like that, it can be very dull.'' Of each 50 students who enroll in the program, <PERSON> McNulty </PERSON> said about 15 drop out. `` We've lost a couple good ones to love,'' <PERSON> McNulty </PERSON> said. `` They get back and their girl says, ` If this is the way it's going to be, get yourself another girl.' To be a sailor's wife, it takes a special kind of gal.''

 A debate is raging in the financial world these days over whether home prices might be headed for the same kind of crash that hit the stock market a year ago. Without question, this is a touchy subject. As a group, American individuals and families have an enormous stake in residential real estate, much greater than they have ever had in stocks. Of course, the two markets and the assets traded in them differ in many significant ways. Housing fulfills a basic human need, while stocks are a purely financial proposition. Still, no free market is immune to a decline, regardless of what commodity is traded in it. The argument got under way in earnest two months ago, when <PERSON> Barron </PERSON>'s magazine published an article on the `` coming collapse in home prices,'' citing warnings from analysts at the respected investment firm of <ORGANIZATION> Comstock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partners </ORGANIZATION>. Since that story appeared there has been something of a rush by other analysts to rebut it. Contrary to the general impression, said <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Yardeni </PERSON>, economist at <ORGANIZATION> Prudential-Bache </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION>, `` the amount of mortgage debt owed by American households is surprisingly low, especially relative to the value of their homes.'' That would seem to minimize the danger of widespread defaults and forced home sales at sacrifice prices, even in the age of the adjustable-rate mortgage and the home equity loan. But more than debt, the question that troubles some observers is simply whether home prices are too high. They have been rising faster than the Consumer Price Index for some 25 years now, and that presumably can not continue indefinitely. One way to gauge the market is affordability _ the level of home prices measured against people's ability to make the down payments and qualify for the mortgages necessary to sustain those prices. <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> <PERSON> Cardiff </PERSON>, publisher of the investment advisory letter Sound Advice, calculates an affordability ratio that compares the median family income -LRB- for a hypothetical household that earns more than half the population and less than the other half -RRB- with the `` qualification income'' necessary to pay the median price for existing houses. For the first half of this year, by <ORGANIZATION> Cardiff </ORGANIZATION>'s reckoning, it took an income of $ 27,290 to pay the median national home price of $ 88,283. Since the actual median family income was $ 31,341, he says, the national affordability ratio was a positive 1.15. `` When the ratio is above 1.0, houses are affordable and the market can be expected to remain strong,'' <ORGANIZATION> Cardiff </ORGANIZATION> declares. But the national picture is by no means uniform, he adds. Affordability ratios vary drastically from region to region and from one metropolitan area to another. <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>, after suffering through the energy recession of the past several years, has an extremely high affordability ratio of 1.88. By contrast, on the East and West coasts, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> all have affordability ratios of less than 1, an indication that `` homes have become dangerously unaffordable,'' by <ORGANIZATION> Cardiff </ORGANIZATION>'s reasoning. To some, <ORGANIZATION> Cardiff </ORGANIZATION>'s analysis may seem a bit simplistic. The factors that influence home prices from place to place are many and complex. In any case, however, <ORGANIZATION> Cardiff </ORGANIZATION> makes an important point: The national real estate market is far from homogeneous. True, a nationwide economic slump or worldwide financial crisis would stand to depress home prices everywhere. But in the experience of the 1980s, economic trends have been anything but uniform. <PERSON> Yardeni </PERSON> concluded, `` We anticipate ` rolling recessions' which will depress different sections of the country at different times. `` Home prices could fall in those regions of the country that are experiencing a recession. But prices should continue to rise in cities and suburbs that remain prosperous.''

<TEXT>
 A few days after <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> disclosed its top executives were considering offering shareholders $ 75 a share for the company, a competing offer of $ 90 a share came from another group. The first offer, from the insiders, would have totaled $ 17.6 billion. The second, from <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kravis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Roberts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, was for $ 3 billion more, an amount more than the assets of companies such as <ORGANIZATION> Wang </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratories </ORGANIZATION> or Inland Steel. The huge difference brings up many questions, including the fundamental question of how value is determined. But even this is not as intriguing as another, which is: What is the responsibility of corporate officers? On an even larger scale, questions are arising about what some critics see as a no-man's land of regulation that is allowing some of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s biggest companies to disappear, with unusually huge benefits to a relative few. The insider question, while perhaps not the most important, is increasingly meaningful in light of the concern about trading activities of those who have access to inside information, i.e., information not available to the public. Nobody, for example, is more privy than those who run companies. Corporate officers know meaningful things not available to the public, its employees, its shareholders, and competitors for ownership. They know which parts of the company are likely to do best; not just the divisions, but the plants within the divisions and the departments, too. They know which parts must be sold, which kept, which developed into new profit centers. They are aware of products not yet on stream, of personnel to be promoted, of opportunities to be seized. Knowing all this, however, does not necessarily put them in a position to make the best offer to the company's shareholders in a leveraged buyout. It might, in fact, make it even more difficult to present the best offer. By its nature, that is, a leveraged buyout is among other things an attempt by buyers to get the maximum leverage, to obtain the utmost for the least, and even to benefit personally in a way more profitable than any other available. Confronted with a buyout situation, does the corporate officer look out for the best interests of the company and its shareholders? Or of himself? Does a management seeking to buy the company work to boost the company _ or does it wait until the deal is complete, thus making it a better deal for them? Buying out companies has become a prop under the current level of stock market prices, a rage that accounts for much of the daily activity. Researchers now study candidates for buyout rather than a company's sales and earnings. Speculators buy not for earnings prospects but in anticipation of an offer. The main defense of buyouts is that they maximize shareholder investments and get rid of complacent management, but there are other sides to that story, too. That they immediately raise trading prices can hardly be denied; but often the company is headed for dismemberment and sale, meaning the high per share price is a one-time thing. There are no further increases. Dividends may cease. At the same time, many of these shareholders appear to benefit more than they really do. Long-term investors, for instance, have no choice but to sell, thus incurring capital gains taxes that otherwise would have been deferred. Most observers also concede that complacent management is at least put back on its toes. But sometimes a company is vulnerable, at least temporarily, not because of poor management but because it is gearing up for the longer term. Critics of buyouts say that other aspects of the phenomenon are not handled any better by regulators. Bondholders can be devastated by sharp declines in value. Equity is often replaced by low-grade debt. Workers may lose jobs. Communities may lose taxes. The economy might lose some of its strongest international competitors. As the takeover battle rages, the questions mount. Is all this the reconstruction of corporate <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, as sometimes is said, or might it be its dismemberment?

<HEAD>Campaign Draws to Close as Dukakis Fights to Overcome Sizable Bush
Lead</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DONALD M. ROTHBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Political Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 The long 1988 campaign, often more negative than enlightening, is racing to a close with <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> offering competing visions of `` a better <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' and thousands of other candidates wary of fallout from the presidential race. More than 90 million Americans will go to the polls on Nov. 8 to select a successor to <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, choose one-third of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and the entire House. Twelve states will elect governors. Thousands of other races for state and local offices as well as scores of initiatives will be on ballots throughout the country. For the Democrats, the prospects were for continued sway over <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> _ their <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> majority only a longshot risk, their House control secure. Democrats also were optimistic about adding up to four governors to their ranks. But in Election Day's biggest contest, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was an underdog in his bid to recapture the White House for the Democrats after two <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> landslides. Republican <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who found a political as well as moral virtue in loyalty to his chief, was bidding to become the first sitting vice president since <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Buren </PERSON> in 1836 to win election to the presidency. While polls gave <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> the edge going into the final week, they also profiled an electorate unhappy with the choice and the negative tone of the campaign. `` I think there's a kind of reluctance for people to commit themselves to one of two people, neither of whom they like,'' said I.A. <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>, chief of polling for the <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>. `` Neither of these guys seems to attract the kind of commitment that some other presidential candidates have had,'' said <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Hugick </PERSON>, of the Gallup Organization. Those assessments suggested to <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> strategists an opportunity for a last-minute shift in sentiment. The <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor was closing out his campaign with a strong populist message combined with counterattacks against <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> commercials portraying him as soft on crime and defense. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> portrayed <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> as the candidate of the rich who would benefit from his own proposal for a cut in capital gains taxes and said the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> nominee was `` running a campaign based on distortions and distractions _ and outright lies. Why? Because he ca n't win an election where the real issues are discussed.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> countered: `` There are signs showing in the opposition camp of desperation _ using ads that accuse us of lies.'' The competing candidates crossed paths regularly in the big states crucial to their hopes of gaining the 270 electoral votes needed for election. Voters in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> had the best chance of seeing one or both of the candidates in person. For most Americans, the best view was 30-second glimpses on their television sets. Both candidates, who began their fall campaigns with $ 46.1 million in federal funds, were expected to buy 30 minutes of network time for election-eve appeals to voters. Watching the presidential campaign with uncommon interest were other candidates, particularly Democrats with vivid memories of the 1980 <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> landslide in which Republicans picked up 12 <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> seats to gain control of the body for the first time in a quarter century. Democrats regained a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> majority in 1986 and entered the current campaign with a 54-46 edge. Of the 33 <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> seats contested this year, 18 are held by Democrats and 15 by Republicans. Six incumbents _ three in each party _ did not run for re-election. Democrat <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Robb </PERSON> appeared certain to pick up the open <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> seat in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, where he is a prohibitive favorite over Republican <PERSON> Maurice </PERSON> <PERSON> Dawkins </PERSON>. The race for another GOP open seat in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> was considered a tossup between former Republican Sen. <PERSON> Slade </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorton </PERSON> and Democratic Rep. <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Lowry </PERSON>. Republicans were optimistic about their chances to win open Democratic seats in <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. Two Republican incumbents were on the highly endangered list _ Chic <PERSON> Hecht </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> and <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Karnes </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION>. Among Democrats, the incumbents with the strongest challenges were <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Lautenberg </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Metzenbaum </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>. `` With good breaks, a strong top-of-the-ticket effort which we're getting ... and with general good luck, we could do it,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> campaign committee spokesman <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Mason </PERSON> when asked whether the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> can win the seats they need _ five if there is a <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> vice president, four if there is a Republican, to claim control of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> In the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, strategists in both parties were predicting minimal shifts from the current lineup of 255 Democrats and 177 Republicans. Three seats are vacant. No one was predicting a shift of more than five seats for either party. In races for governor, the Democrats appeared to have a good chance to enlarge their current 27-23 edge nationwide. The most endangered incumbents were Republicans <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> DiPrete </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> Bangerter </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Arch </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>. In addition, Democrat <PERSON> Evan </PERSON> <PERSON> Bayh </PERSON> was favored in the race to succeed Republican Gov. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Orr </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, who was ineligible for another term. While candidates often hoped for a boost from presidential race coattails, that was usually an elusive advantage. The 1980 <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> landslide was credited with helping many Republican candidates, but when he carried 49 states in 1984, his party lost two <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> seats.

<TEXT>
 For <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, the 1988 campaign was a political roller coaster. The vice president started out facing demands that he separate himself from <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and establish his own identity. Economic hard times in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> and the Iran-Contra scandal were considered formidable obstacles in <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s path to the White House. The first major test in the fight for the Republican presidential nomination _ the <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> precinct caucuses _ bore that out when <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> finished an embarrassing third behind <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> GOP leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> and television evangelist <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>. But a funny thing happened on the way to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s political funeral. He bounced back to win the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> primary. After suffering two more Midwest defeats in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> effectively closed out the GOP race on Super Tuesday when he won all 16 primaries, most of them in the South. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> had a longer road. He finished a respectable third in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> and then won <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> and established his front-runner status on Super Tuesday. But poor showings in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> kept the race open. In the spring, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> found his stride and reeled off a series of primary victories that narrowed the field to himself and <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. Week after week, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> beat <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and also saw national polls giving him a strong lead over <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. By the end of the Democratic National Convention in July, polls said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was favored over <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> by a margin of up to 17 points. His choice of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> as a running mate was widely applauded and was regarded as a direct challenge to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in his adopted home state _ the third biggest electoral prize. A month later it was <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s turn. In contrast to <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' choice of <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> selection of Sen. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> was widely criticized. The rival candidates used almost identical words to state their overall goal. `` I seek the presidency to build a better <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> _ it's that simple,'' said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. `` I want to be president not because it's the next rung on the ladder but because it's the way to act on my values and build the best <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. But the campaign rhetoric did n't remain that lofty. The Democratic nominee was strangely silent during the summer while the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign unleashed a strong campaign focusing on <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' veto of legislation requiring recitation of the pledge of allegiance, his state's prison furlough program, and pollution in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION>. Not until the final weeks of the campaign, when polls had shifted from the impressive <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> lead to a steady margin for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, did the Democratic nominee start striking back. Not only did <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> finally respond to the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> attacks, but he also began sounding a new and sharper populist message. `` <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> wants to help the people who already have it made,'' he told large, enthusiastic crowds. `` I want to help every American family make it.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was closing out his campaign by staying with the pattern that had worked so well to date _ days that usually began with an issues speech and by afternoon shifted to standard stump rhetoric including the attacks on <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> as soft on crime and defense and as an unrepentant liberal.

<TEXT>
 Rep. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stallings </PERSON> sat nervously on the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> floor as the seemingly interminable 100th <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> lurched toward adjournment more than 2,000 miles from his <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> congressional district. <PERSON> Stallings </PERSON>, a two-term Democrat, is one of about 40 representatives who face tough re-election fights, and the late-night <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> sessions forced him to cancel a series of campaign appearances. `` Nothing replaces the individual contact with the constituents,'' he said. Activists from both parties expect that when the smoke clears, many of those struggling incumbents _ about evenly divided between both parties _ will be victorious. And if history repeats itself, nearly all of the 408 members of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> seeking re-election will be there when the 101st <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> convenes in January. In 1986, 385 of the 393 <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> incumbents seeking re-election _ 98 percent _ were victorious. Of the winners, nearly nine out of every 10 captured at least 60 percent of the major party vote, considered a landslide margin. `` Accountability to voters may be a vestigal memory,'' says <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Waldman </PERSON>, legislative director of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Watch </ORGANIZATION>, a frequent critic of congressional practices. `` Members fear popular discontent, but they really need n't be because it rarely results in their defeat.'' Presidential elections can affect congressional races, but <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> incumbents from the party that loses the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> rarely suffer massive losses. When President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> swamped <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Mondale </PERSON> by taking 49 states in 1984, Republicans picked up only 14 seats in the House. The Republicans gained 34 House seats on <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s coattails in 1980, yet <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> brought in only one additional House Democrat in 1976. Even with Republican presidential nominee <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> showing a steady lead over Democratic rival <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> in the polls, no one expects the Democrats' 255-177 advantage in the House _ there are three vacancies _ to be seriously diminished. Spokeswoman <PERSON> Peggy </PERSON> <PERSON> Connolly </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Campaign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> says the overall change in the parties' numbers in the chamber will probably be two to five seats in either direction. <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Lotterer </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, said he expects the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> to gain some seats, but adds, `` No one's looking to take over the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>.'' A large reason for this is that incumbents have several built-in advantages. Their districts, drawn up by their home-state legislatures, are often shaped to include as many friendly voters as possible. They usually have a much easier job than their opponents do of raising campaign money. For the 1986 elections, candidates in the 435 <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> races spent $ 211 million, with incumbents outspending challengers by almost 3-to-1. In addition, incumbents have staffs, district offices, mailing privileges, telephones, and other perks that they can turn to their political advantage. They also get to introduce legislation that helps the folks back home. In the final days of the 100th <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Stallings </PERSON> got the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> to pass legislation designating a new national reserve and a national monument in southern <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>. `` While my opponent is issuing press releases, I'm back here legislating,'' he said of his rival, Republican <PERSON> Dane </PERSON> <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON>. <PERSON> Stallings </PERSON>, of course, was not the only <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> member last week eagerly awaiting the chance to return to his district for campaigning. Some other incumbents who face stiff challenges are: _ Seven-term veteran Rep. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lagomarsino </PERSON>, R-Calif., whose challenger _ state Sen. <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> _ atypically expects to spend the same $ 1 million the incumbent has _ Rep <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Bates </PERSON>, D-Calif., whose <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> opponent, attorney <PERSON> Rob </PERSON> <PERSON> Butterfield </PERSON>, received a boost from reports that <PERSON> Bates </PERSON> has sexually harassed female staff aides _ Rep <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON>, R-Ga., who was running a tight race against Democrat <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> even before <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON>'s indictment on charges of lying to a grand jury investigating money laundering _ Rep <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Hiler </PERSON>, R-Ind., who faces a rematch with Democrat <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Ward </PERSON>, whom he defeated by 47 votes in 1986's closest congressional contest _ Rep <PERSON> Clyde </PERSON> <PERSON> Holloway </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-La </LOCATION>., who like two years ago is challenged by Democrat <PERSON> Faye </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> The economically blighted district is 85 percent Democratic and 35 percent black, but <PERSON> Holloway </PERSON>, a white, defeated <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, who is black, by 51 percent to 49 percent last time. _ Rep <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Emerson </PERSON>, R-Mo., a four-term member who underwent treatment for alcoholism His district is one of the poorest in the country.

<HEAD>Ballot Issues Focus on Gun Control, Insurance Rates, Taxes,
Abortion</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LEE MITGANG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 From gun control in <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>, to a smoking ban in <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> and tax cuts in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>, 234 ballot issues will be decided by voters in 41 states on Election Day. <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, birthplace a decade ago of a voter-driven tax revolt that quickly spread to many other states, has two of the nation's most closely watched contests Californians will choose among five separate ballot measures reducing automobile insurance premiums. Insurers, fearing a nationwide `` insurance revolt,'' are spending more than $ 40 million in an attempt to defeat the proposals. `` The fear is that some of the worst parts of the initiatives would eventually find their way into the thinking of insurance regulators across the country, even in states which do n't allow voter initiatives,'' said <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Goodfriend </PERSON>, an insurance industry analyst for <ORGANIZATION> Prudential-Bache </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION>. Also controversial is California Proposition 102, which would eliminate the statewide anonymous AIDS testing program, allow insurers and employers to screen prospective clients and workers, and require health officials to do everything `` reasonably necessary'' to halt the epidemic, including tracing the contacts of anyone exposed to the AIDS virus. The chief sponsor is <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Gann </PERSON>, the tax crusader who helped spearhead property tax-slashing Proposition 13 a decade ago, and who is now suffering from acquired immune deficiency syndrome because of a tainted blood transfusion. Among other ballot contests: _ <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> voters will decide whether to keep a law passed this spring designed to ban cheap handguns known as Saturday Night Specials The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rifle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> has pumped $ 3 million into the repeal effort. _ Oregonians will vote on whether to toughen the <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> Indoor Clean Air Act, which was passed in 1981 and bans smoking in most public buildings The new proposal would wipe out designated smoking areas and impose an outright ban on smoking in virtually all indoor work areas and enclosed public places. Californians, meanwhile, will consider a proposal to raise cigarette taxes by 25 cents a pack, using proceeds to promote health. _ In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, Gov <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> is pushing a $ 3 billion transportation bond issue, the biggest borrowing in state history, to fix roads and bridges. Opponents challenge the wisdom of such a huge borrowing for that purpose. _ <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> voters will decide measures that would reduce various taxes Dakota Proposition II would roll back property taxes on agricultural property to 1 percent of 1984 values, and 2.5 percent on non-agricultural property in stages by 1991.

<HEAD>Democratic Control Seems Safe</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM DRINKARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Republicans looking for gauges of how they will fare in the nation's 33 <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> races on Election Day can take little hope from the two most closely contested battles: <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> have open seats that Republicans hope to claim in their uphill battle for retaking control of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, which they won in 1980 and lost six years later. In both, Democrats are showing surprising last-minute strength. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, where polls show a dead heat, Republican former Sen. <PERSON> Slade </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorton </PERSON> is airing testimonial ads that seek to plant doubts about the ideology of liberal Rep. <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Lowry </PERSON>. `` <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Lowry </PERSON> scares the hell out of me,'' says one voter in the ad. But <PERSON> Lowry </PERSON> is running strongly with appeals to environmental and social issues and criticisms of <PERSON> Gorton </PERSON>'s record. Republican Rep. <PERSON> Connie </PERSON> <PERSON> Mack </PERSON> is taking a similar tack in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. He is trying to link his opponent, Rep. <PERSON> Buddy </PERSON> <PERSON> MacKay </PERSON>, to Democratic presidential candidate <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> in a TV spot that claims both are against such weapons systems as the B-1 bomber, the MX missile and President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s `` Star Wars'' defense idea. `` Hey, <PERSON> Buddy </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> _ you're liberal,'' it concludes. But polls show the two candidates dead even, despite Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s 20-point advantage over <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> in the state. Democrats now enjoy a 54-46 advantage in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. Republicans' longshot hopes to shift five seats depend on a combination of money and a good <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> showing in key states In some areas, the favorite tactic is to link the Democrat to <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. But as it has throughout this election year, the scorecard still seems to be leaning the Democrats' way. Of 15 Democrats seeking re-election, all are considered at least safe; some hold double-digit leads. Of the dozen <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> incumbents, two _ <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sen </LOCATION>. Chic <PERSON> Hecht </PERSON> and appointed <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Karnes </PERSON> _ are trailing popular Democratic challengers. In six open seats _ where no incumbent is on the ballot _ the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> holds a decided advantage in <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>, the Democrats in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>, and two, <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, are up for grabs. Republicans have conceded all along that they would need every lucky break to retake the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, including a strong coattail effect from <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. While the presidential contest seemed to be giving marginal boosts to Republican hopefuls in a few states, it appears far short of the kind of sweep that gave the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> control in 1980, when a 12-seat shift accompanied <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s landslide White House win. `` It's not like 1980, when there was a need among voters to voice change,'' said <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Mason </PERSON>, communications director for the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senatorial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Chlopak </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senatorial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Campaign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, agreed: `` 1980 was a repudiation of high interest rates. You do n't have that dynamic'' this year. To the extent there are themes running throughout the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> races, they seem to be items chosen from the idea grab-bag to suit each state: the environment, Social Security, education, crime and drugs, and `` family issues'' such as day care are favorites. Democrats have sought to claim the issues as their own, but Republicans have made use of them as well. Seen less frequently are the ideological labeling campaigns such as the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> is waging in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, and vague `` for the future'' or `` for the state'' appeals. Here is a rundown on some of the pivotal contests: <LOCATION> WASHINGTON </LOCATION> _ In addition to each other, <PERSON> Lowry </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gorton </PERSON> are battling their own negative images. The formerly bearded and often-rumpled <PERSON> Lowry </PERSON> has adopted a clean-cut, neatly pressed persona and toned down his rhetoric to appease voters wary of his liberalism. <PERSON> Gorton </PERSON> has done televised `` mea culpas'' for the cold and haughty reputation that contributed to his 1986 defeat. <LOCATION> FLORIDA </LOCATION> _ MacKay's surprising strength may stem partly from his come-from-behind victory in a <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> primary runoff Oct. 4. That kept his name before the voters, and the party appears united behind him. <PERSON> Mack </PERSON>, who has held poll leads throughout the election season against a changing array of <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> opponents, has been criticized for running an outmoded 1980-style campaign based on Reaganesque `` less government'' themes. If presidential coattails have an effect this year, they will show up here. <LOCATION> CONNECTICUT </LOCATION> _ Incumbent Republican <PERSON> Lowell </PERSON> <PERSON> Weicker </PERSON> always has a tight contest. A recent <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Connecticut </ORGANIZATION> poll showed him even with state Attorney General <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Lieberman </PERSON>, who is running as a nuts-and-bolts politician and accusing <PERSON> Weicker </PERSON> of being preoccupied with grand consititutional issues and forgetting his state's parochial interests <PERSON> Weicker </PERSON>, a skillful politician, is not to be counted out. <LOCATION> NEW </LOCATION> <LOCATION> JERSEY </LOCATION> _ Some of the nastiest television ads of the year appear to be eroding the margin of freshman incumbent <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Lautenberg </PERSON>. His GOP opponent, <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Dawkins </PERSON>, found that his own impressive resume _ <PERSON> Rhodes </PERSON> scholar, <PERSON> Heisman </PERSON> trophy winner, <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> general _ did n't automatically translate into political capital. But Republicans now claim public resentment of <PERSON> Lautenberg </PERSON>'s own negative advertising has put <PERSON> Dawkins </PERSON> within striking distance. <LOCATION> NEVADA </LOCATION> _ <PERSON> Hecht </PERSON>, the incumbent, criticized as inarticulate and ineffective, has always been the underdog against popular Democratic Gov. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON>. But recent developments have tightened the spread to single digits. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> surprised <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON> forces by announcing support for <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> as the site of a high-level nuclear waste repository, known locally as the `` screw <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION>'' plan. <PERSON> Hecht </PERSON> is busily linking the two governors, while <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON> is scrambling to establish independence from <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> on the issue. <LOCATION> WISCONSIN </LOCATION> _ <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> nominee <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Engeleiter </PERSON> has used televised debates to chip away at the lead of millionaire Democrat <PERSON> Herb </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>, a political novice. <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> has sought to turn his wealth and self-financed campaign into a selling point, calling himself `` nobody's senator but yours'' and reaching for the independent mantle of retiring Sen. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Proxmire </PERSON>. Time is on <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>'s side. <LOCATION> MISSISSIPPI </LOCATION> _ Republican Rep. <PERSON> Trent </PERSON> <PERSON> Lott </PERSON> holds a small and shrinking lead over Democratic Rep. <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Dowdy </PERSON>, who is appealing to the state's Democratic tradition and supporters of retiring veteran Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Stennis </PERSON>. <PERSON> Lott </PERSON> holds a 4-1 financial advantage going into the home stretch, which, with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s popularity, could make the difference.

 Democrats are given a good chance of retaking the governor's mansion in <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> as 12 states fill their top job in contests that have grown closer and nastier with the approach of Election Day Allegations of racism shadow <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>'s campaign; in <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, the hiring of a reputed mobster's ex-wife for a state job has become an issue, and the race in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> has used television with notably creative malice.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> says orders for `` big-ticket'' durable goods plunged an unexpected 4.1 percent in September.

<HEAD>Minorco Drops Hostile Bid For Consolidated Gold Fields</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Minorco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> SA </ORGANIZATION>'s decision to drop its proposed $ 4.73 billion hostile takeover of <ORGANIZATION> Consolidated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gold </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fields </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION> does not necessarily mean the South African partnership is halting its pursuit of Gold Fields, analysts say. <ORGANIZATION> Minorco </ORGANIZATION> dropped its bid Tuesday after the government's <ORGANIZATION> Monopolies </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mergers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> said it would investigate the deal's impact on the market for strategic metals, effectively blocking the deal from proceeding for up to three months. The offer _ the biggest takeover bid ever for a British company _ had been conditioned on it not being referred to the commission. Although some analysts said <ORGANIZATION> Minorco </ORGANIZATION> might sell its 29.6 percent stake in Gold Fields, others said <ORGANIZATION> Minorco </ORGANIZATION> likely would wait to see the outcome of the investigation, and proceed with a new bid if the commission rules in its favor. The developments followed a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> district judge's decision in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> on Monday to issue a temporary injunction against the offer on antitrust grounds. Gold Fields had contended that a takeover by <ORGANIZATION> Minorco </ORGANIZATION> would give that company control of 35 percent of the Western world's gold supplies, compared with its present 20 percent share. Gold Fields owns a 49.3 percent stake in New York-based <ORGANIZATION> Newmont </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mining </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, plus minority stakes in Australian and South African mining companies. <ORGANIZATION> Minorco </ORGANIZATION> has said it would sell Gold Fields' Newmont and South African holdings if its bid succeeded <ORGANIZATION> Minorco </ORGANIZATION>'s offer was for 19 pounds -LRB- $ 33.25 -RRB- in cash and one <ORGANIZATION> Minorco </ORGANIZATION> share for every two Gold Fields shares it did n't already own. At Tuesday's closing level for <ORGANIZATION> Minorco </ORGANIZATION> shares of 658 pence -LRB- $ 11.52 -RRB-, the offer valued each <ORGANIZATION> Consolidated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gold </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fields </ORGANIZATION> share at 12.79 pounds -LRB- $ 22.38 -RRB-. Consolidated Gold Fields' shares plummeted on news of the referral, falling 106 pence -LRB- $ 1.85 -RRB- to finish at 11.39 pounds -LRB- $ 19.97 -RRB- on <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> <PERSON> Birch </PERSON>, an analyst with the <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> investment firm <ORGANIZATION> Kleinwort </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Grieveson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>, said, the commission's decision was a setback for <ORGANIZATION> Minorco </ORGANIZATION>. But he said the commission likely would rule in <ORGANIZATION> Minorco </ORGANIZATION>'s favor and that <ORGANIZATION> Minorco </ORGANIZATION> could then revive its bid. Gold Fields has raised strong objections to being acquired by a company that is South African-controlled. <ORGANIZATION> Minorco </ORGANIZATION> is the Luxembourg-based investment arm of the South African gold and diamond mining giants, <ORGANIZATION> Anglo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> De </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Consolidated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd </ORGANIZATION>. The wealthy South African Oppenheimer family holds unspecified stakes in the latter two companies. <ORGANIZATION> Minorco </ORGANIZATION> is unlikely to return to its former role of passive investor in Gold Fields, which it has played since first taking a significant stake in the company in the early 1980s, analysts agreed. Gold Fields Chairman <PERSON> Rudolph </PERSON> <PERSON> Agnew </PERSON> said at a news conference that the company plans to continue its defensive tactics, including taking steps to boost its share price. <PERSON> Agnew </PERSON>, who said he was `` delighted'' by the decision to turn the case over the monopolies commission, would not elaborate on what steps Gold Fields might take. Trade Secretary <PERSON> Lord </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON>, who referred the matter to the monopolies commission, asked it to report to him within three months. The investigation will center on the proposed takeover's impact on strategic metals, titanium and zircon in particular, a spokesman at the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industry </ORGANIZATION> said. `` It was thought a merger would lead to greater concentration of the world's supply, which would be a potential detriment to users in the <LOCATION> U.K. </LOCATION>,'' said the department spokesman, who spoke on condition he was not identified. Titanium, a metal largely used as a whitener in paints, also is used in jet engines. <PERSON> Zircon </PERSON> is mainly used as a refracting agent in glass and steel furnaces, but is also a critical substance in nuclear submarines and power plants, and in rocket nose cones. One possible course of action that could satisfy the commission would be for <ORGANIZATION> Minorco </ORGANIZATION> to sell <ORGANIZATION> Consolidated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gold </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fields </ORGANIZATION>' interests related to the strategic metals titanium and zircon, analysts said.

<HEAD>Mid-October Sales Up for U.S. Makers</HEAD>

<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> automakers say they sold 14.8 percent more cars and light trucks in mid-October than they did one year ago, when the stock market crash and lack of dealer incentives kept buyers away from showrooms. Automakers on Tuesday reported selling 318,664 cars and light trucks during the Oct. 11-20 period this year, compared with 246,835 during the same period last year. There were nine selling days in mid-October this year and eight last year, so the percentage change is based on the daily sales rate rather than on total sales for the period. For months, the year-to-year sales comparisons have been colored by heavy use of incentives in the summer and early autumn of 1987. But most of those incentives expired Oct. 1, 1987, while incentives continued this month, further fogging comparisons. Sales in mid-October 1988 were beginning to return to a more normal pace, said analyst <PERSON> Kathleen </PERSON> <PERSON> Heaney </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Nikko </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` We're beginning to compare against a very weak period last year, including the October 19 stock market crash,'' she said `` You're probably going to see the same kind of numbers in the next 10-day period.'' Among the Big Three automakers, <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> car sales rose to 29,269 this year from 19,909, a 30.7 percent increase on the basis of daily sales in the mid-October period. This year, <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> has sold 873,107 cars, compared with 775,401 cars it had sold by Oct. 20 last year, a 12.1 percent rise. Part of the mid-October increase, <PERSON> Heaney </PERSON> said, is attributable to <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION>'s shifting some small-car production in 1987, and the introduction of two popular large cars. `` You have the -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Dodge </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- Dynasty and -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Yorker </LOCATION> which were launched at this time last year and those sales ... have been strong all year,'' she said. `` That helps build this number up.'' <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> reported a 14.4 percent surge in its car sales in mid-October, going to 59,613 this year from 46,335 last year. So far this year, <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> has sold 1,803,920 cars, an 8.9 percent rise from the 1,650,391 cars it sold through Oct. 20 last year. <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's largest automaker, said it sold 93,086 cars during mid-October, up 8.1 percent from the 76,509 cars it sold during the same period last year. In 1988, <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION>'s car sales have increased 0.3 percent to 2,984,066 from 2,962,654 last year.

 <ORGANIZATION> Kraft </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, determined to retain its independence or drive up the price of any takeover, has told hostile suitor <ORGANIZATION> Philip </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cos. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> it would negotiate only if <ORGANIZATION> Philip </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morris </ORGANIZATION> raised its $ 90 a share takeover bid to more than $ 110 a share In a strongly worded letter Tuesday, <PERSON> Kraft </PERSON> <PERSON> Chairman </PERSON> and Chief Executive Officer <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Richman </PERSON> said his company was determined to push ahead with a defensive recapitalization plan that it proposed when <PERSON> Kraft </PERSON> rejected <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Morris </PERSON>' $ 11 billion buyout offer. `` The recapitalization plan will take place only if our shareholders approve it,'' said <PERSON> Richman </PERSON> in a letter to <PERSON> Hamish </PERSON> <PERSON> Maxwell </PERSON>, his counterpart at <ORGANIZATION> Philip </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morris </ORGANIZATION>. `` <PERSON> Kraft </PERSON> will not pressure its shareholders, nor will <PERSON> Kraft </PERSON> permit you to stampede them,'' said <PERSON> Richman </PERSON>. <PERSON> Kraft </PERSON> stock, which soared $ 10 a share on Monday, closed down $ 3 a share at $ 99 Tuesday in active <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> trading. <PERSON> Kraft </PERSON> contends the recapitalization announced Sunday would pay shareholders more than $ 110 a share in cash and securities. The suburban Chicago-based company has acknowledged that interest and principal payments for such a program are estimated at more than $ 12.4 billion. And analysts say <PERSON> Kraft </PERSON> _ maker of Velveeta cheese, Sealtest ice creams and a raft of other fresh and frozen food products _ would increase its debt tenfold to finance the plan, and would be forced to sell some operations to pay for it. Even so, <PERSON> Richman </PERSON> indicated <PERSON> Kraft </PERSON> will not be pressured into accepting terms its board considers inadequate. `` <PERSON> Kraft </PERSON> was not ` for sale' and is not ` for sale.' There is no auction of <PERSON> Kraft </PERSON> ... If <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> or another company truly wishes to negotiate with <PERSON> Kraft </PERSON>, a simple phone call proposing -LRB- the sweetened price -RRB- is all that is necessary,'' said <PERSON> Richman </PERSON>. New York-based <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Morris </PERSON>'s response suggested that call would n't be forthcoming soon. `` Everybody from the market itself to arbitrageurs to people who have evaluated the matter have questioned whether their recapitalization is worth anywhere near $ 110,'' a spokesman for <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> who refused to be named said Tuesday. `` As for the letter, we're evaluating our options,'' he said. `` And at the moment, we have nothing more to say about it.'' Both the market and some analysts reacted unfavorably. `` Quite frankly, <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Morris </PERSON>' offer looked like a pretty good beginning,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Maxwell </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, who tracks the food industry for <ORGANIZATION> Wheat </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION> `` While I thought <PERSON> Kraft </PERSON> might get a few dollars more, at $ 90 a share, the -LRB- first takeover -RRB- offer was already about 15 for 16 times the earnings for 1988 _ a pretty good premium.'' <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Bierbusse </PERSON>, analyst with <ORGANIZATION> A.G. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Edwards </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Sons in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>, said the letter contained nothing new. `` Obviously, <PERSON> Kraft </PERSON> felt some need to clarify the position it expressed with the recapitalization.

<HEAD>Dollar Slightly Higher In Quiet Trading, Gold Also Up Slightly</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The dollar rose slightly in quiet European trading this morning as the market waited for release of the preliminary report on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economic growth in the third quarter. Gold prices also were up slightly in calm trading. Foreign exchange dealers said the third-quarter gross national product figures scheduled for release later today would probably provide some guidance to the market. One <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> dealer said the market expects a 3 percent to 3.5 percent rise in the GNP. `` It's nothing much to look forward to,'' the dealer said, noting that the GNP expanded at a 3 percent pace in the second quarter. A trader in <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> predicted the GNP figures would have little impact on the foreign exchange market. `` Maybe it will move the waters for about 10 minutes, but the dollar is basically trendless,'' he said. In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, where trading ends before <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s business day begins, the dollar fell 0.07 yen to a closing 126.80 yen. Later, in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, it was quoted higher at 126.85 yen. Other dollar rates at midmorning, compared with late Tuesday's rates, included: 1.7913 West German marks, up from 1.7860; 1.5190 Swiss francs, up from 1.5175; 6.1175 French francs, up from 6.1100; 2.0173 Dutch guilders, up from 2.0170; 1,332.30 Italian lire, up from 1,332.00; and 1.2015 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1990 In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, the dollar rose against the British pound. It cost $ 1.7525 to buy one pound, cheaper than $ 1.7535 late Tuesday. Gold opened in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> at a bid price of $ 407 a troy ounce, down from Tuesday's late bid of $ 407.25. But at midmorning, the city's five major bullion dealers fixed a higher recommended price of $ 407.50 In <LOCATION> Zurich </LOCATION>, the bid price was $ 407.40, up from $ 407 bid late Tuesday. Earlier, in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, gold rose $ 1.24 to close at a bid $ 409.76. Silver was quoted in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> today at a bid price of $ 6.24 a troy ounce, down from Tuesday's late bid of $ 6.25.

 The nation's economy grew at a modest 2.2 percent annual rate in the third quarter, the poorest performance in about two years, the government reported today. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said the summer drought, a deterioration in the nation's trade performance and a drop in government purchases of defense equipment were responsible for the week growth. The changes left the gross national product, the broadest measure of the economy's health, rising at the slowest pace since a 1.4 percent increase in the fourth quarter of 1986. The GNP advance was down from increases of 3.4 percent in the first quarter and 3 percent in the second quarter of this year. In the bond market, a sensitive barometer of inflation and interest rate trends, prices rallied following the report. The <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION>'s bellwether 30-year bond was up about $ 5 per $ 1,000 face amount, while its yield fell to 8.87 percent from 8.93 percent Tuesday. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> reported Tuesday that total orders for durable goods fell $ 5.0 billion to a seasonally adjusted $ 117.7 billion last month, pulled down by dramatic declines in the volatile defense and transportation sectors. The dollar edged lower against the British pound and Japanese yen but managed to rise against other major currencies. The pound was quoted in late <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> trading at $ 1.7515, up from $ 1.7501 late Monday, while the dollar declined to 126.80 yen from 127.02 yen. The stock market finished narrowly mixed as a trading frenzy in takeover issues subsided. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials gained 3.02 points to close at 2,173.36. Currency traders took the decline in durable goods orders as a sign that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economy could be slowing down, something that would tend to reduce demand for dollars by foreign investors. But economists were reluctant to conclude that the nation's manufacturing boom is ending In other economic news on Tuesday: _ The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Realtors </ORGANIZATION> said sales of existing homes fell 2.2 percent in September after a surprisingly strong summer The decline occurred despite a housing boom in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. _ Automakers reported that sales of U.S.-made cars and light trucks rose 14.8 percent in mid-October from a weak period a year earlier _ The government said wages in the past 12 months have risen an average 3.9 percent Private employer costs for benefits have soared 6.7 percent _ more than double the previous year _ largely on increases in Social Security taxes. The durable goods report for September fits in with other signs of a slowdown last month, including the second consecutive decline in retail sales and a drop in manufacturing employment. But analysts said it was too soon to declare that manufacturing, which has driven robust economic growth this year, is slowing significantly. A boom in export sales, fueled by the lower value of the dollar, has kept factories humming. Manufacturers in turn have invested heavily to expand the capacity of their plants, spurring the fastest growth in capital spending since 1984. Durable goods, items expected to last three or more years, include a wide range of manufactured items, from refrigerators and other household appliances to large computers and battleships. Orders had jumped 5.7 percent in August, plummeted 7.4 percent in July and soared 8.7 percent in June.

 Share prices were higher at midday Wednesday, but trading was sluggish amid nervousness ahead of Thursday's release of British trade figures for September. The market's positive tone came in part from a steady trend in sterling and British government bonds, dealers said. Recent weakness in the pound hit equities earlier in the week as worries surfaced that interest rates might be pushed higher to support the British currency. The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-stock index was up 7.1 points, or 0.4 percent, at 1,854.9 at midday. Volume was thin, with just 224.4 million shares changing hands, compared with 214.9 million shares at the same time Tuesday.

 The stock market headed lower today in an unenthusiastic response to new evidence of slowing economic growth. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials fell 14.93 to 2,158.43 in the first half hour of trading. Losers outnumbered gainers by about 3 to 2 in nationwide trading of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> Exchange-listed issues, with 366 up, 545 down and 477 unchanged. Volume on the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> came to 27.29 million shares as of 10 a.m. on Wall Street. The government estimated this morning that the gross national product grew at a 2.2 percent annual rate, after adjustment for inflation, in the third quarter of the year. That fell short of most advance estimates, and marked the slowest pace since the final three months of 1986. Wall Street has been looking for evidence of slower business expansion growth as reassurance that the economy was not approaching the point of overheating. But the details in the latest data did not support hopes for an improved international trade balance, increased business investment and a slackening in consumer spending. The dollar weakened after the report was issued and so, after a brief period of hesitation, did stock prices as well.

 The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economy grew at a modest 2.2 percent annual rate from July through September, the weakest performance in almost two years, the government reported today. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> blamed the weak growth rate on the impact of the summer drought, a deterioration in the country's trade performance and a drop in government purchases of defense equipment. The changes left the gross national product, the broadest measure of the economy's health, rising at the slowest pace since a 1.4 percent increase in the fourth quarter of 1986. The GNP advance was down from increases of 3.4 percent in the first quarter and 3 percent in the second quarter of this year. With the slower growth came an easing in inflationary pressures as a price index tied to the GNP rose at an annual rate of 4.4 percent from July through September, down from 5.5 percent in the second quarter. Many economists viewed the GNP report as good news because the slowdown should reduce the need for the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> to drive interest rates higher as a way of dampening demand in an overheated economy. `` The burden will certainly be off the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> to tighten because of inflationary pressures,'' said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>, head of a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> forecasting firm. `` This appears to be heading us toward the soft landing everyone was looking for.'' <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> Undersecretary <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortner </PERSON> said that the latest GNP report shows the economy is still enjoying steady growth in the expansion following the 1981-82 recession. `` Next month marks the sixth anniversary of this economic expansion,'' he said. `` With good policy direction and a bit of luck, we can break the all-time record expansion of almost nine years achieved during the 1960s.'' The 2.2 percent GNP growth rate was sharply lower than had been expected. Many private analysts had been looking for growth of around 3.2 percent in the third quarter, even higher than the second quarter. The weaker-than-anticipated showing threw in doubt the ability of the economy to meet the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration's projection of 3.5 percent growth for the entire year. Reaching that level will require an increase of 3.4 percent in the fourth quarter. Given the fact that many analysts believe the economy has begun to slow, a rebound in growth in the final three months of the year is not considered likely. The government said growth in both the second and third quarters was depressed by the drought. Without the loss of farm output, the economy would have raced ahead at a 4.3 percent rate in the second quarter and 2.8 percent in the third quarter. Also depressing growth in the third quarter was the first quarterly deterioration in the country's trade performance in a year. The deficit between imports and exports widened at an annual rate of $ 2.7 billion in the third quarter. This setback was blamed on the fact that imports, which had fallen in the second quarter, shot up by 12.4 percent, swamping a 10.1 percent rise in imports. Government spending dropped at a rate of $ 2.7 billion in the third quarter, after having risen by $ 7.4 billion in the second quarter. The turnaround was blamed on a big decline in defense purchases. Before today's report, many economists had been looking for the economy to turn in its best growth performance since 1984, the last presidential election year. In that year, the GNP had shot up by 6.4 percent, a giant increase that many believed helped President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> win re-election. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has been campaigning on a prosperity theme this year, citing the fact that the country is now enjoying a peacetime record six straight years of economic growth. The various changes left the GNP, after adjusting for inflation, rising at a rate of $ 22.1 billion in the third quarter to a new level of $ 4.007 trillion. Consumer spending, which has propelled growth throughout the long recovery, continued to provide much of the momentum in the third quarter, rising at a rate of 3.5 percent, up from a 3 percent increase in the second quarter. Business investment, which has been surging this year as industry rushed to expand production facilities, rose by 4.6 percent in the third quarter, down from a 15 percent jump in the second quarter. Residential construction, which has been weak this year, rose a modest 1.3 percent in the third quarter.

 <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> said today its earnings rose 21.8 percent to a record in the third quarter compared with the same three-month period last year, based on strong overseas sales. The nation's No. 2 automaker said it earned $ 856.3 million, or $ 1.78 per share, in the July-September period, up from $ 703.2 million, or $ 1.38 per share, during the third quarter of 1987. Revenue rose nearly 16 percent to $ 17.7 billion from $ 15.3 billion a year earlier. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>'s stock fell 37 -LCB- cents a share to $ 53.62 -LCB- a share by midmorning on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> as the overall market lost ground. The earnings during the quarter were down 48.4 percent from the company's industry record of $ 1.66 billion in earnings in the second quarter. Typically, third-quarter earnings are lower than other quarters for automakers because of factory retooling to gear up for the new model year, which traditionally begins Oct. 1. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> team's successful effort worldwide to provide products with improved quality and good customer value again is evident in our third-quarter results,'' <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Petersen </PERSON> and Vice Chairman <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Poling </PERSON> said in a joint statement. The company said its overseas earnings amounted to $ 384 million during the quarter, up 249 percent from the $ 110 million earned from overseas operations during the period last year. In the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, the company's earnings fell 20.4 percent to $ 472 million during the third quarter this year from $ 593 million during the period last year. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> blamed the performance on higher costs for new products and lower earnings by <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> are expected to announce their third-quarter earnings figures Thursday. For the first nine months of the year, <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>'s earnings rose 12.2 percent to $ 4.1 billion, or $ 8.53 a share, on sales of $ 60.9 billion, compared with earnings of $ 3.7 billion, or $ 7.17 a share, on sales of $ 52.9 billion, a 12.2 percent increase. For the first two quarters of 1988, <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> posted industry world records, making $ 1.62 billion in the January-March period and $ 1.66 billion in the April-June period. In the first two quarters of this year, <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> said its record-setting profits also were bolstered by strong international sales, mostly from <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>'s domestic sales fell during the first half of the year compared with the first six months of 1987, because of incentives, higher labor and material costs, and development of new products. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> said losses in its <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> and product costs were offset partially by higher shares of the car and truck markets and more efficient manufacturing processes. <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, which includes <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Credit </ORGANIZATION>, First Nationwide, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Leasing and the company's international credit operations, added 35 cents per share to third-quarter earnings, 14.6 percent less than the group contributed during the third quarter of last year. The company said benefits from a lower tax rate and increased receivables were offset by lower earnings at <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Credit </ORGANIZATION> and First Nationwide.

 <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Wang </PERSON>, a former rookie securities analyst who pleaded guilty to participating in the second biggest insider trading case in history, was sentenced to three years imprisonment today by a federal judge who told him, `` You had a brilliant future and you blew it.'' <PERSON> Wang </PERSON>, 24, stood motionless as <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Duffy </PERSON> lectured him about his illegal act before imposing the sentence, which also includes three years' probation. <PERSON> Wang </PERSON>, who would be eligible for parole after a year, could have been sentenced to five years and heavy fines for each of three fraud counts against him. Shaking his head, <PERSON> Duffy </PERSON> said, `` <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Wang </PERSON>, I hope to God you never end up in a court of law again.'' <PERSON> Wang </PERSON>, a former junior analyst at the investment firm <ORGANIZATION> Morgan </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stanley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, admitted to scheming with Taiwan-born businessman <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> to profit on secret tips about impending corporate takeovers that <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON> <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> was handling. <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>, who is not in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, allegedly made $ 19 million on the information provided between July 1987 and April 1988, and paid $ 200,000 to <PERSON> Wang </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, which sued the pair in late June, had demanded the return of the illegal profits plus triple damages for a total of $ 76 million, making it the second biggest insider trading case behind that of convicted felon <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON> <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON>. In 1986, <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON> agreed to pay a $ 100 million penalty to settle charges of trading on insider information. He is serving a three-year prison term after pleading guilty last year to conspiring to file a false statement with the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Before </PERSON> <PERSON> Wang </PERSON> was sentenced his lawyer, <PERSON> Ira </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sorkin </PERSON>, told the judge his client `` fully recognizes the seriousness of the crimes. At no time has he sought to minimize his involvement or the seriousness of what he has done.'' <PERSON> Sorkin </PERSON> said, `` He's broke, he has no job, he's unable to finish his education, he has no place to live except with relatives. He disgraced his family and hurt the firm that trusted him.'' <PERSON> Wang </PERSON>, wearing a gray suit with a dark, dotted tie, told <PERSON> Duffy </PERSON>, `` I'm deeply sorry for what I've done. I've incurred a lot of debts and losses of other people. I'm going to try to make amends for it.'' But <PERSON> Duffy </PERSON>, calling it a particularly troubling case, rebuked <PERSON> Wang </PERSON> because he had grown up in an affluent family and had no excuse for what he did. `` Apparently, the first time you could have been a crook, you were,'' <PERSON> Duffy </PERSON> said. `` In the eyes of society, a person who knowingly goes out to harm the world, becomes a person who must be punished,'' the judge said. <PERSON> Duffy </PERSON> said a fine was inappropriate because <PERSON> Wang </PERSON> had no money. `` As far as I can figure out, you're worth zero,'' the judge said. `` Therefore any punishment at all has to be in the area of imprisonment.'' <PERSON> Duffy </PERSON> gave <PERSON> Wang </PERSON> one month to get his affairs in order before surrendering to the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prisons </ORGANIZATION>. The exact location of his imprisonment has not been determined, but <PERSON> Sorkin </PERSON> told reporters afterward he would try to have <PERSON> Wang </PERSON> placed in a facility near his family, who live in the <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> area. <PERSON> Sorkin </PERSON> declined to comment on the appropriateness of the sentence, saying, `` I do n't try to second-guess judges.'' Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> McEnany </PERSON> also declined comment on the sentence.

<DATELINE>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Cray </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>'s announcement that its 1988 earnings growth would be less than expected not only caused one of the largest one-day declines in the supercomputer maker's stock but also hurt its credibility on Wall Street, analysts say. `` Cray is getting savaged by earnings revisions,'' said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Geran </PERSON>, an analyst in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> for <ORGANIZATION> Nikko </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION> Earlier this year, <PERSON> Cray </PERSON> predicted 10 percent earnings growth for 1988, but on Monday it reduced that to 5 to 7 percent. On Tuesday, <ORGANIZATION> Cray </ORGANIZATION>'s stock on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> lost $ 9 to close at $ 59.87 -LCB-, a decline of 13.1 percent on a trading volume of nearly 1.7 million shares. It slipped another 12 -LCB- cents in early trading today to $ 59.75 a share. In the past two years, the stock has traded has high as $ 135 a share. Analysts said the one-day decline Tuesday was the largest they could remember for <ORGANIZATION> Cray </ORGANIZATION>, and they attributed it to Monday's surprise announcement. `` I think there's been credibility damage, and there will be a lingering impact,'' said <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Smaby </PERSON>, a Minneapolis-based analyst for <ORGANIZATION> Needham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. Inc. in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> `` The fact is that we've seen nothing but news of decreasing earnings expectations for the last year and a half, and a lot of investors are fatigued with the story,'' said <PERSON> Jeffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Canin </PERSON>, an analyst for <ORGANIZATION> Hambrecht </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Quist in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. `` Investors looking to get into the stock now are going to have to take a longer-term investment horizon, about 12 to 18 months,'' <PERSON> Smaby </PERSON> said. `` There will be no meaningful -LRB- earnings and revenues -RRB- growth next year.'' <ORGANIZATION> Cray </ORGANIZATION> said the decline in anticipated 1988 earnings is primarily the result of an additional $ 10 million in spending on the Cray-3 supercomputer, the latest development of company founder <PERSON> Seymour </PERSON> <PERSON> Cray </PERSON>. Next year's revenues are expected to be adversely affected by increasing trade-in allowances and a shift toward computers being leased rather than sold, the company said. <PERSON> Canin </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Cray </ORGANIZATION> is moving through a difficult product transition period from the Cray-2 to the not-yet-introduced Cray-3 and from the enhanced versions of its older <ORGANIZATION> Cray </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> X-MP </ORGANIZATION> supercomputers to the new Cray Y-MP.

<HEAD>A&amp;P Withdraws Offer For Delchamps</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MONTVALE, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Supermarket giant A & amp; P today withdrew a $ 210 million tender offer for <ORGANIZATION> Delchamps </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a day after directors of the Mobile, Ala.-based grocery chain rejected a higher merger proposal. At a meeting late Monday, <ORGANIZATION> Delchamps </ORGANIZATION> directors decided A & amp; P's proposal to acquire the chain for $ 32-a-share, or $ 32 a share in a friendly transaction was inadequate <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Wood </PERSON>, chairman and chief executive of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Great </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tea </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> called that proposal a `` final'' offer. The company had a $ 30-a-share tender offer outstanding. A.F. <PERSON> Delchamps </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, chairman of the board and president of the company that bears his name, replied: `` We would hope that Mr. <PERSON> Wood </PERSON> can be taken at his word, since we agree with him that the dissension brought on by this takeover fight is not in the best interest of our company or our shareholders.'' <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> <PERSON> Swanson </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Delchamps </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, said the nine-member board unanimously rejected the sweetened offer. A & amp; P began trying to buy <ORGANIZATION> Delchamps </ORGANIZATION> two years ago, but this year became more aggressive by launching a tender offer. <ORGANIZATION> Delchamps </ORGANIZATION> attorney <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> McDonald </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> said the board's decision was based on a number of factors, including <ORGANIZATION> Delchamps </ORGANIZATION> recent store expansion efforts and other programs designed to enhance the value of the company He said the board's decision was also based upon the advice of counsel that such a takeover could pose antitrust problems. <ORGANIZATION> Delchamps </ORGANIZATION> has a federal court suit pending in Mobile against A & amp; P on the antitrust allegations. A & amp; P, which is 52 percent owned by the <ORGANIZATION> Tengelmann </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, filed a countersuit. <ORGANIZATION> Delchamps </ORGANIZATION> had sales of about $ 700 million last year.

 The stock market declined slightly today in an unenthusiastic response to new evidence of slowing economic growth. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials slipped 4.97 to 2,168.39 by 11 a.m. on Wall Street. Losers outnumbered gainers by about 3 to 2 in nationwide trading of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> Exchange-listed issues, with 458 up, 686 down and 535 unchanged. Volume on the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> came to 61.24 million shares at midmorning. The government estimated this morning that the gross national product grew at a 2.2 percent annual rate, after adjustment for inflation, in the third quarter of the year. That fell short of most advance estimates, and marked the slowest pace since the final three months of 1986. Wall Street has been looking for evidence of slower business expansion growth as reassurance that the economy was not approaching the point of overheating. But the details in the latest data did not support hopes for an improved international trade balance, increased business investment and a slackening in consumer spending. The dollar weakened after the report was issued and so, after a brief period of hesitation, did stock prices as well. Losers among the blue chips included <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machines </ORGANIZATION>, down -RCB- at 122 -LRB-; <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION>, down \ at 44 -RRB-; <ORGANIZATION> Eastman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION>, down -RCB- at 48 -LRB-, and <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Paper </ORGANIZATION>, down -LCB- at 47 \ <LOCATION> Bethlehem </LOCATION> Steel, by contrast, rose -RRB- to 20 | in active trading The company reported sharply higher operating earnings for the third quarter. The <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION>'s composite index of all its listed common stocks fell .27 to 158.60.

<HEAD>Four Big Banks Ask Fed For Underwriting Powers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Four major commercial banks have asked the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> for broad powers to underwrite and deal in corporate securities after <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> failed to pass legislation granting such authority. The applications by <ORGANIZATION> Citicorp </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Chase </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manhattan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> J.P. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morgan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Bankers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> were sent to the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday, according to a <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> spokesman. Banking experts say they expect most other big banks to follow suit. `` If <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> ca n't agree to do it the banks will attempt every possibility they can,'' <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Ogilvie </PERSON>, an executive vice president with the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bankers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, said Wednesday. The move by the four banks could set the stage for a battle between <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> over which body will determine the future structure of the banking industry. <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> has supported banks' efforts to win broader securities powers, and <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> governor, said recently that the central bank would look favorably on bank applications for greater securities powers if <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> adjourned without passing legislation. Attempts by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to repeal the Depression-era Glass-Steagall Act, which separates commercial and investment banking, have been underway for six years. The most promising bill by <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Proxmire </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Wis </LOCATION>., and chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, died in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, along with more restrictive bill passed by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> After it appeared his bill was doomed, <PERSON> Proxmire </PERSON> encouraged banks to turn to the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> for broader powers. In their applications, <ORGANIZATION> Citicorp </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Chase </PERSON>, <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Bankers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> sought permission to underwrite and deal in corporate debt. Chase, <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Bankers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> also sought permission to deal and underwrite stock, with <ORGANIZATION> Chase </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bankers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> adding preferred stock to their wish list. Two weeks ago, Chase President <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> LaBrecque </PERSON> had vowed to seek <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> approval if efforts to pass legislation failed. Banks have maintained that they need expanded powers to compete with foreign banks that can underwrite securities in this country, while critics maintain such powers could endanger the safety of the nation's banking system. Last spring the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> upheld a lower court ruling that allowed the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> to grant more than a dozen banks authority to underwrite commercial paper, municipal revenue bonds, mortgage-backed securities and securties backed by consumer loans.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> Gekko </PERSON>, the ruthless inside trader in the movie `` Wall Street,'' had a motto _ `` Greed is good'' _ that to many encapsulated the philosophy of freewheeling corporate merger speculators. Members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, after passing the first legislative response to the wave of insider trading scandals that erupted two years ago, are hoping to replace the motto with another _ `` Greed is dangerous.'' `` Greed and fear are competing emotions, but until now there has not been a proper balance between the two. I think now the fear of apprehension is going to be at least as great as the lure of greed,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Markey </PERSON>, D-Mass., chief sponsor of the bill and chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee that oversees the securities markets The bill passed the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> 410-0 last month and by a voice vote in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> early Saturday morning in the waning hours of the 100th <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. The securities industry's chief lobby group acquiesced to the legislation and President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> is expected to sign it. Its key provisions would: _ Increase the maximum criminal penalties for insider trading from five years in jail to 10 years, and boost fines from $ 500,000 to $ 2.5 million for a company and from $ 100,000 to $ 1 million for an individual _ Hold firms liable to fines for the actions of their employees if the firms `` knowingly or recklessly'' fail to detect and prevent insider trading _ Authorize the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> to offer a bounty to tipsters of up to 10 percent of any fine collected _ Codify the right of investors to sue inside traders if they lost money by trading in the same securities and at the same time as insiders _ Permit the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> to issue subpoenas and investigate inside trading on behalf of foreign countries, with the idea that foreign countries would offer reciprocal privileges to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> The <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> and the industry had been pushing for a legislative definition of inside trading, which until now has been defined by regulators and the courts. But, to win the support of <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Dingell </PERSON>, D-Mich., the bill leaves inside trading undefined <PERSON> Dingell </PERSON> believes a written definition would in effect become a road map to evasion, providing defense attorneys with loopholes. The industry complains it is unfair to give only vague guidance. <PERSON> Markey </PERSON> predicted the most immediate effect of the bill will be to change the attitude toward insider trading, a crime that is both hard to detect and difficult to prove. `` Jail is the greatest fear these white collar criminals have,'' <PERSON> Markey </PERSON> said. In addition, firms, because of the new liability provisions, `` ca n't be like the three monkeys and say just because they are deaf, dumb and blind they can get off,'' he said. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baldwin </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administrators </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, an organization of state regulators, said he hopes the most immediate psychological effect will be on small investors who have been scared out of the market by the perception that the little guy ca n't get a fair deal trading in the same stocks as big-time arbitragers. `` If <PERSON> John </PERSON> Q. Public feels like he's the only guy not making a profit and the inside traders are cutting all the good deals, he's going to take his business elsewhere The first thing this bill does is give the individual investor the feeling that someone cares about him,'' he said. The impact from provisions granting individuals the right to sue insiders and offering bounties to informers may take longer to emerge, but ultimately could be more profound. `` We're in a litigious society. If people or their lawyers can find a way to go after deep pockets, they'll usually do it,'' said <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Brien </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. At the urging of the <ORGANIZATION> SIA </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Markey </PERSON> made the threshold for suing firms _ the knowing or reckless clause _ tougher than originally proposed. The <ORGANIZATION> SIA </ORGANIZATION> also has reservations about the bounties, as does <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruder </PERSON>, who has said juries may not believe a witness who was paid a bounty. `` It's somehow a little offensive to me. It's a little bit in the Big Brother tradition,'' <PERSON> O'Brien </PERSON> said. But <PERSON> Markey </PERSON> argues that bounties have worked well for the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> in catching tax cheats and, he said, he is working on a plan to offer <PERSON> Ruder </PERSON> an incentive to use bounties despite his qualms. The <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> under <PERSON> Ruder </PERSON> has sought more money to hire additional enforcement attorneys. <PERSON> Markey </PERSON> said next year he'd like to find a way to give the agency a cut of any extra fine revenue that is produced by offering bounties.

 Grain and soybean futures prices opened mixed to slightly lower today on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>. Analysts called the market featureless. Soybean futures were mostly lower because of favorable weather reports in the growing regions of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and sizeable domestic stocks. Wheat futures nudged ahead following a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> report that <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> would purchase 1 million tons under the export bonus program, and smaller overnight buys by <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> may have supported prices as well. On the opening, wheat was 1 \ cent lower to -LCB- cent higher, with the contract for delivery in December at $ 4.07 -RCB- a bushel; corn was -LCB- cent to 1 cent lower, with December at $ 2.73 a bushel; oates were unchanged to 1 cent higher, with December at $ 2.36 -LCB- a bushel; and soybeans were 3 cents lower to 2 -LCB- cents higher, with November at $ 7.58 -LCB- a bushel Livestock and pork futures were lower on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. Live cattle were .15 cent to .40 cent lower, with the December contract at 74.35 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .12 cent to .35 cent lower, with October at 81.75 cents a pound; live hogs were .12 cent to .37 cent lower, with December at 42 cents a pound; and frozen pork bellies were .50 cent to 1.05 cents lower, with February at 50.45 cents a pound.

<HEAD>Tenneco Initiates Cash Offer for Stock Buyback</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 In a move to increase its stock value, <ORGANIZATION> Tenneco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> initiated a cash tender offer today to buy back 18 million shares of its own stock for more than $ 1 billion through a `` Dutch auction.'' <ORGANIZATION> Tenneco </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ketelson </PERSON> said the sale of <ORGANIZATION> Tenneco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> earlier this month and the proposed repurchase of 12.18 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Tenneco </ORGANIZATION>'s total outstanding stock demonstrates the company's commitment to increasing shareholder value by concentrating its resources on its `` most promising'' opportunities However, some on Wall Street were expected to view the terms of the share repurchase as disappointing. In a Dutch auction, which <ORGANIZATION> Tenneco </ORGANIZATION> launched early today, shareholders specify the price at which they are willing to sell their stock back to the company, within a range established by the buyer. Based upon the number and price of the shares tendered, <ORGANIZATION> Tenneco </ORGANIZATION> officials said they will determine the single per share price within a specified $ 50 - $ 55 range that will permit the company to buy all 18 million shares <ORGANIZATION> Tenneco </ORGANIZATION> then will buy the stock tendered at that price or less, subject to possible proration. The cash sales will not be subject to the usual transaction costs associated with open market sales, <ORGANIZATION> Tenneco </ORGANIZATION> officials said. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Olson </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, said a Dutch auction is `` probably the most sensible way'' to buy back stock. But he said <ORGANIZATION> Tenneco </ORGANIZATION>'s offer is not likely to win acclaim on <LOCATION> Wall </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Street </LOCATION> where analysts were expecting a more conventional offer at a higher price of $ 60 or so. On the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tenneco </ORGANIZATION>'s shares were trading at $ 50 -LCB- this morning, up from $ 49.875 on Tuesday. <PERSON> Olson </PERSON> said Houston-based <ORGANIZATION> Tenneco </ORGANIZATION> is passing up a `` God-given opportunity'' to build the strongest balance sheet in years. `` Buying back stock may be attractive to some shareholders, but it does n't augment the company for the long term,'' <PERSON> Olson </PERSON> said. He attributed that buy-back decision to <ORGANIZATION> Tenneco </ORGANIZATION>'s management being under pressure to `` do something for the shareholders.'' `` They sold off their crown jewel -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Tenneco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> -RRB-. That gives them a great opportunity to go into the next business downcycle with a strong balance sheet and golden opportunities to acquire companies in related areas that would be hard hit by any recession,'' <PERSON> Olson </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Tenneco </ORGANIZATION>'s offer is not conditioned upon any minimum number of shares being tendered. The only condition, company officials said, is that <ORGANIZATION> Tenneco </ORGANIZATION> receive at least $ 1.5 billion in proceeds from its $ 7.3 billion sale of <ORGANIZATION> Tenneco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION>. The tender offer is set to expire at midnight Nov. 28. After paying for the stock, the company will use the remainder of the proceeds to reduce its hefty debt of $ 8.5 billion. With the sale of its oil and gas properties, <ORGANIZATION> Tenneco </ORGANIZATION>'s biggest units will be the profitable natural gas pipeline and its Case IH farm equipment manufacturing sector. In addition, <ORGANIZATION> Tenneco </ORGANIZATION> maintains shipbuilding, automotive, packaging and chemicals units.

 Employment costs have risen faster than inflation over the past 12 months, but largely because of soaring benefit costs primarily from higher Social Security taxes rather than wage gains, according to new government data. Wages in the 12 months ended Oct. 1 rose an average of 3.9 percent, the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday, compared with a 4.2 percent increase in consumer prices over the same period. But benefit costs have soared more than 6.7 percent _ more than double the 3.1 percent gain during the previous 12 months, the department's <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Statistics </ORGANIZATION> said. The combined effect of the pay raises and higher benefit costs sent total employer costs up 4.7 percent in the 12 months ended Oct. 1, compared with a 3.4 percent rise in the previous 12-month period, it said. The steep increase in benefit costs resulted primarily from a rise last January in employers' Social Security tax rate from 7.15 percent to 7.51 percent, the government said. But there also were large increases in health insurance costs the first nine months of this year, it noted. And for the first time, the government is calculating lump-sum bonus payments from union contracts and profit-sharing arrangements as a benefit. Previously those bonuses had not been included as either wages or benefits. Non-union employees continued to get bigger percentage pay raises than union members _ a trend begun in 1983 _ except for blue-collar workers in manufacturing. The <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said wage rates among union members rose an average 2.9 percent in the past 12 months, compared with 3.9 percent for non-union workers. In the previous 12-month period, union wages rose an average 1.7 percent, compared with 3.8 percent for non-union employees. `` This pattern reversed when limited to blue-collar workers in manufacturing,'' the bureau said, with wage increases in the past year averaging 3.2 percent for union members and 2.8 percent for non-union workers. Including the lump-sum bonus arrangements that have become a norm in many labor contracts, especially in manufacturing, total employer compensation costs have risen the same 4.5 percent for union and non-union workers nationwide, the bureau said. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Zalusky </PERSON>, an economist for the <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION>, called the statistics `` refreshing.'' `` We expected they were in that range,'' <PERSON> Zalusky </PERSON> said. `` They're -LRB- the government -RRB- beginning to show in fact what is really going on out there in the world, but there still is a good way to go. For example, <PERSON> Zalusky </PERSON> cited the last round of steel industry contracts in which the union conceded pay cuts to companies then operating at losses in exchange for a share of future profits or stock transfers if no profits occurred. `` The statistics are now picking up the profit distributions but not the stock transfers for what essentially is a debt owed workers,'' he said. `` In the future I expect them to start putting in the value of stock ownership plans and in the distant future retraining funds, such as those negotiated with the auto companies.'' Despite the disparity in percentage wage increases in recent years, union workers continue to make 35 percent more than non-union workers _ an average gap of $ 123 a week in 1987 compared with a gap of $ 119 in 1986 _ on a nationwide basis, according to government data. Among white-collar workers, wage increases averaged 4.2 percent over the past 12 months, compared with 4 percent the previous 12 months, the government said. Blue-collar wages have increased 3.3 percent and 2.6 percent, respectively, over the same two periods. The biggest pay gains, 5.6 percent on average, were among business and health service workers, followed by average increases of 4.9 percent for professional and technical employees. Managers and executives, along with state and local government workers, have averaged the same 4.7 percent wage gains over the past year. The average pay increase among private industry workers was 3.7 percent. By regions, the biggest pay increases over the past 12 months have been in the <LOCATION> Northeast </LOCATION>, 4.6 percent, followed by the South at 3.8 percent. Average raises in the West and <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> were 3.2 percent and 2.9 percent, respectively. In a separate report, the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said annual pay rose an average 4.6 percent among the 101 million workers with jobs in the nation's 317 metropolitan areas last year. <LOCATION> Kenosha </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wis. </LOCATION>, with large pay increases in manufacturing and construction, had the biggest average increase, up 10.6 percent _ from $ 18,666 in 1986 to $ 20,648 in 1987. The <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Haven-Waterbury-Meriden </LOCATION> area of <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Monmouth-Ocean </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, metropolitan areas were next with average annual pay increases of 8.4 percent last year. On the other end of the scale, workers in <LOCATION> Flint </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>, with a large decline in employment and falling wages in manufacturing, suffered an average pay loss of 4.2 percent _ from $ 26,633 in 1986 to $ 25,514 last year. Other cities where average pay fell last year were <LOCATION> Anchorage </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Ind </LOCATION>.; <PERSON> Enid </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Okla. </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Kan. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Lansing </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Midland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Middlesex-Somerset-Hunterdon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>; and Pine Bluff, Ark. Despite the decline, <LOCATION> Anchorage </LOCATION> maintained the highest average pay level in the country at $ 28,486. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> was next at $ 28,179, followed by the <LOCATION> Bridgeport-Stamford-Nowalk-Danbury </LOCATION> area of <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> at $ 27,832 and <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jose </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, at $ 27,748. <LOCATION> Jacksonville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, again had the lowest average annual pay at $ 13,246, followed by three <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> border areas: McAllen-Edinburg-Mission at $ 13,311, <PERSON> Brownsville-Harlingen </PERSON> at $ 14,087 and <LOCATION> Laredo </LOCATION> at $ 14,093.

 The stock market lost ground today in an unenthusiastic response to new evidence of slowing economic growth. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials slipped 8.53 to 2,164.83 by noontime on Wall Street. Losers outnumbered gainers by about 3 to 2 in nationwide trading of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> Exchange-listed issues, with 493 up, 745 down and 527 unchanged. The government estimated this morning that the gross national product grew at a 2.2 percent annual rate, after adjustment for inflation, in the third quarter of the year. That fell short of most advance estimates, and marked the slowest pace since the final three months of 1986. Wall Street has been looking for evidence of slower business expansion growth as reassurance that the economy was not approaching the point of overheating. But the details in the latest data did not support hopes for an improved international trade balance, increased business investment and a slackening in consumer spending. The dollar weakened after the report was issued and so, after a brief period of hesitation, did stock prices as well. Losers among the blue chips included <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machines </ORGANIZATION>, down ~ at 122; <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION>, down \ at 44 -RRB-; <ORGANIZATION> Eastman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION>, down -LRB- at 48 -RCB-, and <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Paper </ORGANIZATION>, down -LCB- at 47 \ <LOCATION> Bethlehem </LOCATION> Steel, by contrast, rose 1 \ to 21 -LCB- in active trading The company reported sharply higher operating earnings for the third quarter. <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Roebuck </ORGANIZATION>, widely rumored in recent days to be considering a restructuring or other transaction, gained 1 \ to 45 <ORGANIZATION> Wickes </ORGANIZATION> climbed 1 -LCB- to 9 -RRB-. Following the recent abandonment of a $ 12-a-share management buyout plan for the company, a group of investors offered to take it over for $ 11.25 a share. The <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION>'s composite index of all its listed common stocks fell .62 to 158.25. At the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, the market value index was down .68 at 303.70. Volume on the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> came to 91.74 million shares at noontime, up from 77.69 million at the same point Tuesday.

 <ORGANIZATION> Bethlehem </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> today said its third-quarter profit more than tripled on the strength of the steel industry's recovery. Net income for the period rose to $ 101.4 million, or $ 1.18 per share, up from $ 30.4 million, or 46 cents per share, a year earlier. Third-quarter sales rose 23.3 percent to $ 1.43 billion from $ 1.16 billion a year earlier. <LOCATION> Bethlehem </LOCATION> attributed its improved performance to increased shipments, higher productivity and prices and lower financing costs. `` We expect our steel shipments to continue at relatively strong levels through the balance of the year and our prices to remain firm,'' said Chairman <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>. `` There has been some softening in our order entry ... but we believe it to be a temporary situation as underlying steel consumption remains strong.'' For the first nine months, the company earned $ 337.3 million, or $ 4.17 per share, up nearly three times compared to $ 102.8 million, or $ 1.61 per share, a year earlier. Nine-month sale rose 22 percent to $ 4.16 billion from $ 3.41 billion a year earlier.

 <ORGANIZATION> Wickes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cos. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> agreed today to be bought by two <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> investment groups that will pay $ 517 million in cash and assume about $ 2.2 billion in outstanding <ORGANIZATION> Wickes </ORGANIZATION>' debt Announcement of the takeover by <ORGANIZATION> Blackstone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Capital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partners </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Wasserstein </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Perella </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partners </ORGANIZATION> follows by 12 days the withdrawal of a management-led bid to take the retailing and manufacturing conglomerate private. <ORGANIZATION> Wickes </ORGANIZATION> management accepted the investors' bid of $ 11.25 a share, a discount from the $ 12 a share offered by a group led by <ORGANIZATION> Wickes </ORGANIZATION> chairman <PERSON> Sanford </PERSON> <PERSON> Sigoloff </PERSON> in late August and withdrawn Oct. 14. The investors' bid values <ORGANIZATION> Wickes </ORGANIZATION> stock at about $ 517 million. Assumption of debt would bring the total value of the deal to $ 2.7 billion, the companies said in a news release. Officers of <ORGANIZATION> Blackstone </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Wasserstein </PERSON>, <PERSON> Perella </PERSON> would become co-chairmen of <ORGANIZATION> Wickes </ORGANIZATION>, apparently displacing <PERSON> Sigoloff </PERSON>, who brought the company out of bankruptcy in 1985. <ORGANIZATION> Wickes </ORGANIZATION> released a statement from <PERSON> Sigoloff </PERSON> saying the deal would benefit shareholders, but was silent on the executive's future. <ORGANIZATION> Wickes </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Sitrick </PERSON> refused to discuss <PERSON> Sigoloff </PERSON>'s future and said <PERSON> Sigoloff </PERSON> was declining interviews <ORGANIZATION> Blackstone </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Wasserstein </PERSON>, <PERSON> Perella </PERSON> will have equal say in directing the company, which operates furniture stores and the Builders Emporium home improvement stores in <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and has groups that make automotive fabrics, wallpaper and aircraft parts. Co-chairmen will be <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Birle </PERSON>, 52, a <ORGANIZATION> Blackstone </ORGANIZATION> partner and former vice president of <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, and <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> McKeon </PERSON>, 34, a managing director of <PERSON> Wasserstein </PERSON>, <PERSON> Perella </PERSON>, the companies announced. Management had been shopping the company around since the August management buyout offer, which was designed to draw higher bids. That tender offer to stockholders by a Sigoloff-led group included an unusual provision delaying any stock purchases for 60 days, and specifically left the door open to outside offers. It was withdrawn Oct. 14, six days before the expiration date. <PERSON> Sigoloff </PERSON>'s group attributed the withdrawal to new projections that <ORGANIZATION> Wickes </ORGANIZATION>' operating income for the year would be $ 40 million below what had been forecast at the time the offer was made.

 <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s credit arm said today an interest rate pinch cut its third-quarter earnings by 25.5 percent from a year earlier. <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Acceptance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> reported net income of $ 241.9 million from its auto financing, insurance and mortgage operations in the three months ended Sept. 30, down from $ 325 million for the third quarter of 1987. <ORGANIZATION> GMAC </ORGANIZATION> said the decline was due primarily to a narrower margin between interest earned on money loaned out and interest paid to obtain the funds. Its average cost of borrowings worldwide was 8.41 percent for the quarter, compared with 7.89 percent in the same period last year. Also, <ORGANIZATION> GMAC </ORGANIZATION> financed or leased 496,000 new cars and trucks in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> during the period, a 42 percent decline from a 1987 third-quarter boosted by factory-supported financing incentives. <ORGANIZATION> GMAC </ORGANIZATION>'s earning assets reached $ 90.6 billion as of Sept. 30, up 2 percent from a year earlier, the company said. Also reporting earnings today was <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION>'s computer-services subsidiary, <ORGANIZATION> Electronic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which said new commerical contracts helped boost third-quarter net income 17 percent as revenues grew 9 percent. EDS reported third-quarter net income of $ 95.9 million, or 79 cents per share of the <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Class </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> E </ORGANIZATION> common stock that has its returns based on EDS earnings. That compared with $ 82.3 million, or 68 cents a share, in the third quarter of 1987.

 Grain and soybean futures prices were mostly higher Wednesday on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> after sinking in six of the past eight sessions. Analysts described the trading as generally featureless. `` Ninety percent of the trading today was short-covering,'' said <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Lespinasse </PERSON>, a trader with <ORGANIZATION> Dean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Witter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reynolds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. `` More and more people holding short positions started to cover as they realized the market was n't going to break any lower.'' In a short sale, a trader sells a borrowed security in the expectation that prices will head lower before he must replace it. Wheat futures got some support from a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> report that <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> would purchase 1 million tons of wheat under the export bonus program, and smaller overnight buys by <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> may have supported prices as well. Some spillover strength, as well as speculation that lower prices would help stimulate export business, nudged prices ahead in the surrounding pits. On the close, wheat was unchanged to 2 cents higher, with the contract for delivery in December at $ 4.09 a bushel; corn was \ cent to 2 \ cents lower, with December at $ 2.76 a bushel; oats were unchanged to 2 cents higher, with December at $ 2.36 -LCB- a bushel; and soybeans were 6 cents lower to -LCB- cents higher, with November at $ 7.61 a bushel

 The stock market retreated today in an unenthusiastic response to new evidence of slowing economic growth. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials slipped 8.00 to 2,165.36 by 3 p.m. on Wall Street. Losers outnumbered gainers by about 3 to 2 in nationwide trading of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> Exchange-listed issues, with 565 up, 832 down and 524 unchanged. The government estimated this morning that the gross national product grew at a 2.2 percent annual rate, after adjustment for inflation, in the third quarter of the year. That fell short of most advance estimates, and marked the slowest pace since the final three months of 1986. Wall Street has been looking for evidence of slower business expansion growth as reassurance that the economy was not approaching the point of overheating. But the details in the latest data did not support hopes for an improved international trade balance, increased business investment and a slackening in consumer spending. The dollar weakened after the report was issued and so, after a brief period of hesitation, did stock prices as well.

 An estimated 250 <ORGANIZATION> Enron </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> employees are being laid off as part of a reorganization program that will combine positions in the company's corporate staff and natural gas pipeline group, the company said Wednesday. <ORGANIZATION> Enron </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lay </PERSON> cited intense competition for natural gas markets coupled with low sales prices as primary reasons for the staff reductions. Affected employees were notified Wednesday, Executive Vice President <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kinder </PERSON> said. Some of the reductions will be effective immediately, while others will occur during the remainder of the year. <ORGANIZATION> Enron </ORGANIZATION> has about 6,900 employees, including 3,000 in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>. The cuts include jobs at all levels, including officers. Human Resources Vice President <PERSON> Luther </PERSON> <PERSON> Snow </PERSON> is one executive whose position was eliminated. The action follows the elimination of about 35 jobs in <ORGANIZATION> Enron </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, a subsidiary, in late September. <PERSON> Kinder </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Enron </ORGANIZATION> expects the reorganization to save $ 15 million a year. `` It is not a pleasant thing to do, but you ca n't operate in this environment without paying attention to your staff costs,'' he said. Some of the affected employeees may be offered other jobs in the Enron organization. Others will receive severance pay and assistance in finding jobs elsewhere. In addition to the layoffs, the company is negotiating sales of some oil and gas assets valued at between $ 200 million and $ 300 million, Lay said. The properties involved are primarily interests in wells and fields operated by other companies and most sales should be completed by year's end.

 A rookie Wall Street analyst, who once impressed others as an ambitious go-getter, received three years imprisonment Wednesday for his role in the nation's second-largest insider trading fraud. `` You truly fall into the situation of a person who bites the hand that feeds him,'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Duffy </PERSON> said, shaking his head as he sentenced <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Wang </PERSON>, 24. `` You had a brilliant future and you blew it.'' <PERSON> Wang </PERSON>, who had held a promising junior analyst job at <ORGANIZATION> Morgan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stanley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, pleaded guilty last month to fraud for conspiring with Taiwanese businessman <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> to profit in the stock market on secrets about impending corporate takeovers that <PERSON> Wang </PERSON> stole from the firm. He also pleaded guilty to a separate but much smaller insider trading scheme involving another person, whom prosecutors have declined so far to identify. <PERSON> Wang </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> were first exposed in late June by the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, which said <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> made about $ 19 million in illicit profits and paid <PERSON> Wang </PERSON> $ 200,000 for tips provided between July 1987 and last April. <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON> <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON>, which was deeply embarrassed and dismissed <PERSON> Wang </PERSON> immediately, said through spokesman <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Roche </PERSON> that `` We're pleased justice has been served.'' <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> lawyer, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Morton </PERSON>, did not return telephone calls for comment. <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> has n't been charged with any crime and is believed to be living in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> has won court orders freezing the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> assets of <PERSON> Wang </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> and is seeking return of the $ 19 million plus triple damages for a total of $ 76 million, making it the second-biggest insider trading scam behind the <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON> <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON> scandal. A renowned stock speculator, <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON> paid the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> a record $ 100 million in November 1986 to settle insider trading charges, a stunning episode that signaled a government crackdown on Wall Street crime. He was sentenced to three years imprisonment for conspiracy to lie to the enforcement agency. The Wang-Lee case received widespread attention not only because of the amount of money involved, but because both men presumably were brazenly trading on inside information at the height of concern about the <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON> affair. Many law enforcers said this showed insider trading remains a deep-rooted problem. <PERSON> Wang </PERSON> could have been sentenced to five years imprisonment and a $ 250,000 fine for each of three counts against him. But <PERSON> Duffy </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> regional administrator, said he was n't imposing a fine because <PERSON> Wang </PERSON> had no money. `` As far as I can figure out, you're worth zero,'' the judge said. `` Therefore any punishment at all has to be in the area of imprisonment.'' <PERSON> Duffy </PERSON> did not explain the rationale for the three-year sentence, which also includes three years probation. But he lectured <PERSON> Wang </PERSON> on what the judge called inexcusable acts by a young man who grew up in comfortable surroundings, enjoyed a good education and was en route to a successful career. `` You did have practically every break society could give you,'' said the judge, but `` apparently the first time you could have been a crook, you were.'' <PERSON> Wang </PERSON>, wearing a gray suit and dark tie, fidgeted nervously before <PERSON> Duffy </PERSON> pronounced the sentence and stood motionless while the judge spoke. Aside from a few reporters and bystanders, the courtroom was empty. `` I'm deeply sorry for what I've done,'' <PERSON> Wang </PERSON> told the judge. `` I've incurred a lot of debts and losses of other people. I'm going to try to make amends for it.'' <PERSON> Duffy </PERSON> gave <PERSON> Wang </PERSON> a month to settle his affairs before reporting to the federal <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prisons </ORGANIZATION>. His lawyer, <PERSON> Ira </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sorkin </PERSON>, said he would try to have <PERSON> Wang </PERSON> placed in a facility near his family, who live in the <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> area. <PERSON> Sorkin </PERSON>, who like <PERSON> Duffy </PERSON> is a former regional <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> administrator, declined to comment on the sentence. Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> McEnany </PERSON>, who represented the government in the case, also declined to comment. <PERSON> Wang </PERSON> grew up in <LOCATION> Arlington </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Heights </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, attended the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> and landed a coveted junior analyst job at <ORGANIZATION> Morgan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stanley </ORGANIZATION> in June 1986. As a student, he excelled in economics and was considered an aspiring entrepreneur because he had started his own resume advisory service. The local newspaper, which published an admiring story about <PERSON> Wang </PERSON>'s business talents, quoted him as saying that `` if you love what you do, money comes along with it.''

<HEAD>Norfolk Southern's Profit Up 73.7 Percent in Third Quarter</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Norfolk </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> reported Wednesday that its third-quarter profit jumped 73.7 percent from a year earlier, boosted by increased freight traffic and reduced labor costs. The freight railroad company said its net income in the three months ended Sept. 30 rose to $ 179.4 million, or $ 1 a share, from $ 103.3 million, or 55 cents a share, a year earlier. Third-quarter revenue was up 12.8 percent, to $ 1.16 billion from $ 1.03 billion. Norfolk Southern, ranked as the nation's largest railroad company in terms of revenue from railway business, is based in <LOCATION> Norfolk </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va </LOCATION>. The results for the third quarter were announced at a meeting with financial analysts in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Norfolk Southern said the latest results were the best quarterly performance in its history. The company said it achieved a record low railway operating ratio of 72.3, down from 81.8 in the third quarter of last year. Railway operating ratio is the percentage of a company's revenue that goes into operating its railroads. `` The year started off strong for us and has improved every quarter, thanks to increasing traffic and reduced employee costs,'' Chairman <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> McKinnon </PERSON> said. `` Although railway traffic was up 6.2 percent for the quarter and 5.3 percent for the first nine months, railway expenses remained flat. We anticipate this trend will continue for the rest of 1988.'' In the first nine months of the year, profit rose 30.1 percent to $ 456.1 million, or $ 2.51 a share, from $ 350.5 million, or $ 1.85 a share. Nine-month revenue increased 8.2 percent, to $ 3.30 billion from $ 3.05 billion.

<HEAD>Occidental Profit Up; Coastal Earnings Decline</HEAD>

 <ORGANIZATION> Occidental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday that third-quarter earnings more than doubled because of strong gains in its chemical unit, while <ORGANIZATION> Coastal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> said lower crude oil prices drove quarterly earnings down sharply. <ORGANIZATION> Occidental </ORGANIZATION>'s earnings surged 128 percent to $ 105 million or 38 cents a share in the three-month period ended Sept. 30, compared with $ 46 million or 20 cents a share a year earlier. The Los Angeles-based company said revenue rose 16.7 percent to $ 4.9 billion from $ 4.2 billion in the 1987 quarter. <ORGANIZATION> Occidental </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Armand </PERSON> <PERSON> Hammer </PERSON> said healthy advances in the company's chemical operations offset declines elsewhere. `` Although <ORGANIZATION> Occidental </ORGANIZATION> has experienced the detrimental earnings effects of lower oil prices, which in the third quarter of 1988 were more than $ 4 a barrel less than last year, and the loss of our <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> oil production, we are pleased to report that our chemical operations' earnings have significantly increased and have resulted in <ORGANIZATION> Occidental </ORGANIZATION>'s net income more than doubling compared to the third quarter of 1987,'' <PERSON> Hammer </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Occidental </ORGANIZATION> owned the huge oil rig that exploded and sank July 6 in the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION>, killing more than 160 people in the world's worst oilfield disaster. Falling crude oil prices, caused by an excess supply on world markets, has hurt earnings and revenue of most major <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> oil companies. But some have managed to compensate with gains in refining and marketing operations. For the first nine months of 1988, <ORGANIZATION> Occidental </ORGANIZATION>'s earnings totaled $ 295 million or $ 1.23 a share, up 46 percent from $ 202 million or 90 cents a share a year earlier. Revenue totaled $ 14.1 billion, up 11 percent from $ 12.7 billion. Houston-based <ORGANIZATION> Coastal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> said earnings fell 21.4 percent in the latest quarter to $ 9.2 million or 12 cents a share on revenue of $ 1.8 billion, vs. $ 11.7 million or 17 cents a share on revenue of $ 1.6 billion a year earlier. For the first nine months of 1988, <ORGANIZATION> Coastal </ORGANIZATION>'s earnings rose 10.5 percent to $ 86.3 million or $ 1.45 a share, from $ 78.1 million or $ 1.43 a share in the same period last year. The company's revenue totaled $ 5.7 billion, up 16.3 percent from $ 4.9 billion a year earlier.

<HEAD>Survey: Health Care Insurance Fraud Widespread, Costly</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER VILES</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Four out of 10 Americans covered by health insurance have encountered some form of insurance fraud, including being billed for unnecessary tests or for medical services they never received, according to a national survey commissioned by an insurance company. The survey, which is to be released formally on Thursday, was conducted for <ORGANIZATION> Aetna </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Life </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Casualty </ORGANIZATION>, which estimates that health care insurance fraud is responsible for about 10 percent of the $ 555 billion Americans spend on health care each year. `` The survey indicates that there is widespread public awareness _ more than we thought _ that health insurance fraud is hurting consumers,'' <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON>, director of fraud investigations in <ORGANIZATION> Aetna </ORGANIZATION>'s Employee Benefits Division, said Wednesday in an interview. <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> said consumers end up paying higher premiums to cover the cost of fraud. However, the survey found that the most widespread form of health care insurance fraud is one that few consumers complain about. Twenty-three percent of the respondents said their practitioners had accepted insurance reimbursement as full payment, even though their policies required the patient to pay a portion of the bill. Three out of five people required to pay a portion of their medical bills said they would consider switching to a doctor who practices that form of fraud. `` To us, that was an astonishing figure.'' <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> said. He said the study indicated that practitioners who would alter bills in that fashion were likely to practice other forms of fraud, such as billing for unnecessary tests or services not provided. Ten percent of the survey respondents said they had been billed for laboratory tests they felt were unnecessary, and 6 percent said their practitioners had inflated charges. Other forms of fraud cited were billing for services not rendered and charging more for services than had been discussed with the patient. Sixty percent of those responding to the survey said they had no experience with fraudulent tactics. <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> said the study contained both good and bad news for insurance companies. On the positive side, consumers seemed very aware of the terms of their policies and often made an effort to examine their bills. However, consumers were also likely to turn to practitioners when they had doubts about their bills, he said. `` That's like being kidnapped and then asking the person who kidnapped you whether he really meant it,'' <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> said. To counter that, <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Aetna </ORGANIZATION> plans to introduce a fraud hot line. `` We're going to try to make it as easy as possible for consumers to notify the insurance agency,'' he said. The survey found that consumers consider health-care insurance fraud among the most serious forms of white-collar crime. Only stock market insider trading was considered more severe. And a majority of the respondents, 55 percent, said practitioners found guilty of fraud should have their licenses either suspended or revoked. However, respondents to the survey ranked health-care insurance fraud fifth when they were asked why medical costs and insurance premiums have risen over the last several years. Eighty-four percent of those responding said they thought malpractice suits and the cost of malpractice insurance were responsible for the increased costs. And 53 percent blamed insurance companies for causing the increases by seeking to increase their own profits. The cost of new technology and general inflation were both cited by 51 percent, followed by health care insurance fraud, blamed by 47 percent of the respondents. National Family Opinion conducted the survey for <ORGANIZATION> Aetna </ORGANIZATION> by mailing a four-page questionnaire to 1,000 households in August. A total of 705 people responded, giving the survey a margin of error of plus or minus 5 percent. Of those who responded, 91 percent said they had some form of health insurance, and 24 percent said they were covered by Medicare of Medicaid.

 <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s aircraft, auto-electronics and computer-services subsidiaries reported third-quarter gains on Wednesday while an interest rate pinch cut earnings at its financing arm. <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Acceptance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, the credit arm, said its net income sagged 25.5 percent for the three months ended Sept. 30 compared with the third quarter of 1987.

A narrower margin between the interest earned on money loaned out and the interest costs to obtain the funds was the main cause of the decline, <ORGANIZATION> GMAC </ORGANIZATION> said. The company said its average cost of borrowings worldwide rose to 8.41 percent in the third quarter, up from with 7.89 percent in the same period last year. And <ORGANIZATION> GMAC </ORGANIZATION> said it financed or leased 496,000 new cars and trucks in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> during the period, a 42 percent drop from the third-quarter in 1987 when business was boosted by factory-supported financing incentives. For the first nine months of 1988, <ORGANIZATION> GMAC </ORGANIZATION>'s consolidated net income totaled $ 930.2 million, down from a record $ 1,218.2 million for the same period last year. <ORGANIZATION> GMAC </ORGANIZATION>'s earning assets reached $ 90.6 billion as of Sept. 30, up 2 percent from a year earlier, the company said. <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hughes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electronics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> reported third-quarter earnings of $ 180 million, or 45 cents a share of <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Class </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> H </ORGANIZATION> common stock, an issue the earnings of which are determined by <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hughes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electronics </ORGANIZATION>' performance That compared with $ 171 million, or 43 cents a share, in the third quarter of 1987. Quarterly revenues were $ 2.63 billion, up from $ 2.52 billion a year earlier.

<HEAD>Ford Sets 3rd Quarter Earnings Record, But Loses Ground in U.S.</HEAD>

 <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> reported record third-quarter earnings Wednesday and enhanced its reputation as the most profitable automaker in the country, although the performance of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> operations declined. The No. 2 vehicle producer behind <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> earned $ 856.3 million or $ 1.78 a share in the three months ended Sept. 30, vs. $ 703.2 million or $ 1.38 a share a year earlier, a 21.7 percent gain that made it the best third quarter in <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>'s history. Third-quarter sales totaled $ 17.73 billion vs. $ 15.25 billion, a 15.1 percent gain. In the prior four quarters <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> outearned much larger <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION>. The biggest <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> automaker and No. 3 <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> were expected to report third-quarter earnings Thursday. Industry analysts anticipated <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> would continue its string of impressive earnings gains. For each of the past ten quarters, <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> has set new earnings records for itself. `` My guess is that they will earn $ 1.3 -LRB- billion -RRB- or $ 1.4 billion in the fourth quarter,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Healy </PERSON>, who follows the industry for <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` In 1987, it was a little over $ 900 million, so it looks like the next quarter will be up again, easily.'' Despite the earnings outlook, <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>'s stock price fell 87 -LCB- cents a share to $ 53.12 -LCB- on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. Third-quarter auto company earnings usually are lower than other quarters because of factory retooling to gear up for the new model year, which historically has started Oct. 1. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> said earnings this past quarter were based largely on strong overseas sales and not its <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> business. `` We do have a declining -LRB- profit -RRB- margin in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and that's been the case all year,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> McCammon </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>'s vice president for finance and treasurer. `` The overseas margin has been increasing because of outstanding results this year in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and also <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> has come back substantially.'' He pointed to <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>'s performance in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and with <ORGANIZATION> Autolatina </ORGANIZATION>, a joint venture with <ORGANIZATION> Volkswagen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> AG </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> owns 49 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Autolatina </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> McCammon </PERSON> declined to be specific about its results. However, he said, `` <ORGANIZATION> Autolatina </ORGANIZATION> went from a substantial loss in the last third quarter to a profit this quarter.'' Analyst <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Glantz </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Montgomery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> said, `` I estimate -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Autolatina </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- earned $ 70 million this quarter versus a loss of $ 56 million last quarter.'' Overall, <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> said it earned $ 384 million from overseas operations in the third quarter of 1988, up 249 percent from the $ 110 million earned overseas during the period last year. In the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, the company earned $ 472 million in the third quarter, down 20.4 percent from the $ 593 million earned a year earlier. Because of the depressed <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> results, profit sharing for unionized workers will decline this year compared with last, <PERSON> McCammon </PERSON> said. Although he was n't specific, <PERSON> McCammon </PERSON> said it would fall somewhere between the $ 3,700 average per worker in 1987 and the $ 2,100 average the year before. <PERSON> McCammon </PERSON> blamed much of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> decline on development of new products, lower earnings by the company's <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> and a problem with what kinds of cars were available. He said that during the quarter, the company produced 30 percent fewer, high-profit Thunderbirds than a year earlier, while making more <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tempos </ORGANIZATION> and Mercury Topazes, which carry less of a per-car profit. <PERSON> Healy </PERSON> agreed, saying: `` The cost of everything they buy is up. So that and the shutdown of the T'bird and Cougar had an effect on their earnings for the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION>'' <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, which includes <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Credit </ORGANIZATION>, First Nationwide, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Leasing and the company's international credit operations, added 35 cents per share to third-quarter earnings, 14.6 percent less than the group contributed during the third quarter of last year. The company said benefits from a lower tax rate and increased billings were offset by lower earnings at <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Credit </ORGANIZATION> and First Nationwide. For the first nine months of the year, <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> earned $ 4.1 billion or $ 8.53 a share, up 12.2 percent from earnings of $ 3.7 billion or $ 7.17 a share a year earlier. Sales totaled $ 60.9 billion vs. $ 52.9 billion, a 15.1 percent gain.

<TEXT>
 The dollar fell Wednesday to its lowest point since late June as traders reacted to a report of unexpectedly modest growth in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economy. Gold prices rose. Slower growth reduces the chance that the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> will raise interest rates to cool off inflation, analysts said. Lower <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> rates would reduce demand for dollars. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said the gross national product, the broadest measure of the economy, grew at a 2.2 percent annual rate in the third quarter. The market had forecast a 3 percent to 3.5 percent rise. The GNP advance, down from increases of 3.4 percent in the first quarter and 3 percent in the second quarter of this year, was the smallest rise since a 1.4 percent increase in the fourth quarter of 1986. `` What this does is bring us closer to potentially lower interest rates,'' said <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> Sloane </PERSON>, a currency analyst at <ORGANIZATION> Smith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Barney </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Harris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Upham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Co. The currency market's reaction to the GNP report was unusually strong, partly because the market was prepared to drive the dollar down anyway, traders said. In contrast, the bond market, which usually rallies at signs of slower growth, posted only a modest increase. In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, before the report was released, the dollar eased 0.07 Japanese yen to a closing 126.80 yen. Later in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, after the report's release, it dropped to 125.85 yen. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, the dollar fell to 125.71 yen from 126.80 yen Tuesday. The dollar also fell against the British pound. It cost $ 1.7600 to buy one pound in late <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> trading, more expensive than $ 1.7535 late Tuesday. The pound rose to $ 1.7610 in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> from $ 1.7515 Tuesday. Other late dollar rates in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, compared with late Tuesday's rates, included: 1.7750 West German marks, down from 1.7903; 1.5042 Swiss francs, down from 1.5183; 1.1993 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2012; 6.0595 French francs, down from 6.1230; and 1,322.00 Italian lire, down from 1,333.75 Other late dollar rates in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, compared with late Tuesday's rates, included: 1.7745 marks, down from 1.7860; 1.5065 Swiss francs, down from 1.5175; 6.0725 French francs, down from 6.1100; 2.0005 Dutch guilders, down from 2.0170; 1,323.50 Italian lire, down from 1,332.00; 1.1988 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1990 In <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, gold rose $ 1.24 a troy ounce to close at a bid $ 409.76. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, gold fell to $ 407.05 a troy ounce from $ 407.10 Tuesday. In <LOCATION> Zurich </LOCATION>, it rose to $ 407.10 an ounce bid from $ 407 Tuesday. On the Commodity Exchange in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, gold bullion for near-month delivery rose to $ 408.30 a troy ounce from $ 406.40 Tuesday. <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> said gold was bid at $ 408.15 an ounce as of 4 p.m. EDT, up from $ 406.60 late Tuesday. Silver bullion fell in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> to a late bid price of $ 6.21 a troy ounce, down from $ 6.25 late Tuesday. On <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s Comex, silver bullion for near-month delivery rose to $ 6.224 an ounce from $ 6.221.

<HEAD>FERC Approves PacifiCorp-Utah Power Merger, With Conditions</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LES BLUMENTHAL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The proposed $ 2.2 billion merger between <ORGANIZATION> PacifiCorp </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Utah </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Light was approved Wednesday by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regulatory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, but only on the condition that the new company provide space on its transmission lines for other utilities to ship electricity. In a 70-page order, the commission said requirements that the merged company `` wheel'' electricity from other utilities were aimed at alleviating fears it would dominate the sale of power from the inland Northwest to the <LOCATION> Southwest </LOCATION>. `` We believe that the conditions ... are the minimum necessary to alleviate these likely anticompetitive effects so as to make the merger consistent with the public interest,'' the commission said. The merger would create the nation's 13th largest utility serving more than 1.2 million customers in seven western states _ <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>. The commission's handling of the case has been closely watched by the utility industry, which has been swept by talk over the last several years of deregulation and increased competition. The commission, in its order, asserted its right to condition a merger so that it would be `` consistent with the public interest'' and found that without imposing conditions in this case the merger would `` enhance'' the ability of the new company to `` exercise monopoly power.'' The commission ordered that in the short-term the new company must set aside a portion of its transmission line capacity for others to use. In the long-term, the commission said the new company had an `` absolute obligation'' to provide transmission service to any utility that makes a `` bona fide'' request even if that means the company has to build new transmission facilities. The directors of both <ORGANIZATION> PacifiCorp </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Utah </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> are expected to meet early next week to decide whether to proceed with the proposed merger. The companies have 60 days to notify <ORGANIZATION> FERC </ORGANIZATION> of their decision or they can request a rehearing. `` We need to satisfy ourselves that conditions imposed on the merged company will not materially impair our ability to acheive the customer and shareholder benefits we expect as a result of the combination,'' <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Bolander </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> PacifiCorp </ORGANIZATION>'s utility subsidiary <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Light, said in a statement. <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Slattery </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, said that the company was somewhat surprised by the conditions imposed by the commission. `` They appear to be unlike anything we have seen before,'' said <PERSON> Slattery </PERSON>. `` It will take some time to get a firm grip on what the implications are.'' Shareholders of <ORGANIZATION> PacifiCorp </ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ore. </LOCATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> Utah </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION> Salt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, along with regulatory agencies in each of the states and the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> have raised no objections to the merger. But almost two dozen public and private utilities and utility organizations stretching from <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> opposed the merger fearing it would create a mega-utility that would dominate Western energy markets. In June, a <ORGANIZATION> FERC </ORGANIZATION> administrative law judge had recommended rejection of the proposed merger because of the impact it might have on utility competition. <ORGANIZATION> PacifiCorp </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Utah </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> officials have said the merger could result in annual savings of up to $ 150 million over the first five years, stable rates for <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> customers and a drop in rates of up to 10 percent for <ORGANIZATION> Utah </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> customers. <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> and Light currently serves about 670,000 customers in <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Utah </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> has about 510,000 customers in <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Varity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> has halted talks on the possible acquisition of <ORGANIZATION> Fruehauf </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, and the troubled Detroit-based truckmaker said Wednesday it would explore other options. Fruehauf reported a net loss of $ 41.5 million on sales of $ 1.84 billion in 1987. <ORGANIZATION> Varity </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> J.R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Nowling </PERSON> said he did n't expect further efforts to acquire <PERSON> Fruehauf </PERSON> though he did n't rule out discussions about its <ORGANIZATION> Kelsey-Hayes </ORGANIZATION> automotive subsidiary. <PERSON> Fruehauf </PERSON> has struggled with large debts, high interest payments and operating losses in its trailer and maritime operations since managers took control of the company in December 1986 with huge borrowings in a financial transaction known as a leveraged buyout. <PERSON> Fruehauf </PERSON> will continue to explore alternatives including disposition of all or part of <ORGANIZATION> Kelsey-Hayes </ORGANIZATION>, its only profitable unit, <ORGANIZATION> Fruehauf </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Hladik </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Hladik </PERSON> said he knew of no specific suitors, but even during discussions with <ORGANIZATION> Varity </ORGANIZATION>, `` We never closed the door to other offers.''

 Petroleum futures prices finished mostly higher Wednesday following a tumultuous day of trading set off by a report showing a sharp drawdown in gasoline reserves and higher demand levels. In other markets, livestock and pork futures fell; grain and soybean futures rebounded slightly after declining for four straight sessions, and precious metals were mixed in featureless trading. Gasoline stocks were considered to be `` the wild card'' in an <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> report released after the markets had closed Tuesday. The API report showed gasoline stocks fell by more than 3 million barrels _ almost twice what some analysts expected. That, coupled with a rising demand for the product, pushed the price of unleaded gas to 54.50 cents a gallon at one point on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. `` We're seeing demand of about 8 million barrels a day, and we've only seen that six or seven times in the last two years ... and not at all during the period from the late'70s until 1986,'' said <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Beutel </PERSON>, assistant director of <ORGANIZATION> Elders </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Futures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> `` We are back in the land of pre-conservation demand.'' Still, many traders apparently believe gasoline may be near its peak for the short term. Not only was there significant profit-taking Wednesday, but many traders elected to reverse previous positions, selling gasoline and buying heating oil. `` What you saw was everybody heading for the door at the same time,'' said <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Ritterbusch </PERSON>, a vice president at <ORGANIZATION> Carson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. `` And the catalyst that set this in motion was the fact that gasoline appeared so strong.'' West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 15 cents to 19 cents higher at the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, with the December contract at $ 13.41; heating oil was .23 cent to 1.24 cents higher, with November at 41.5 cents a gallon; and unleaded gasoline was .35 cent lower to .20 cent higher, with November at 51.67 cents a gallon. Both livestock and meat futures were lower at the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. Pork futures were clobbered by a report released late Tuesday that indicated the number of frozen pork bellies stored in warehouses was the second-largest ever reported during October. `` That put a bearish shroud over everything on the floor,'' said <PERSON> Chuck </PERSON> <PERSON> Levitt </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. `` Cattle prices are suffering from a small pocket of heavyweight cattle hanging over the market for the moment,'' he continued. `` They should have moved earlier this summer, but it will only take a short while for them to get cleaned up and supplies to get tight again.'' Live cattle settled .25 cent to .85 cent lower, with December at 73.90 cents a pound; feeder cattle were unchanged to .78 cent lower, with October at 81.42 cents a pound; live hogs were .30 cent to 1.02 cents lower, with December at 41.27 cents a pound; and frozen pork bellies were 1.58 cents to 2 cents lower, with February at 49.50 cents a pound. Analysts said the grain market was in need of fresh news, and none was forthcoming Wednesday. But declining prices fueled ideas of renewed export bnusiness and helped lay the groundwork for a modest rally. Wheat futures got some support from a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> report that <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> would purchase 1 million tons under the export bonus program. The notion that lower prices would stimulate export business nudged prices ahead in the surrounding pits. Wheat settled unchanged to 2 cents higher, with December contract at $ 4.09 a bushel; corn was \ cent to 2 \ cents lower, with December at $ 2.76 a bushel; oats were unchanged to 2 cents higher, with December at $ 2.36 -LCB- a bushel; and soybeans were 6 cents lower to 4 -LCB- cents higher, with November at $ 7.61 a bushel Precious metals, meanwhile, finished the day mixed after holding to a narrow range at the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. Prices moved to session highs early when the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar fell because of a lower-than-expected 2.2 percent rise in the third-quarter gross national product. But the lack of follow-through buying, as well the interpretation that the inflation indicators were not as strong as anticipated, sent the metals drifiting. Gold settled $ 1.50 to $ 1.90 higher, with October at $ 408.30 a troy ounce; silver was unchanged to 3 cents hgher, with October at 6.224 cents a troy ounce. Platinum, traded on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, settled 60 cents lower to 10 cents higher, with October at $ 536.40 a troy ounce.

<HEAD>West Point-Pepperell Adopts Severance Plan To Protect Employees In
Takeover</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN A. BOLT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Takeover target <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Point-Pepperell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> has adopted a sweetened severance plan for almost 6,000 employees that provides increased benefits if they are fired within two years of a hostile acquisition. A company official said Wednesday the plan has been considered for some time and is not a direct reaction to this week's $ 1.4 billion bid for the west <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> textile giant. Chicago-based <ORGANIZATION> Farley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, one of the nation's largest privately owned conglomerates, Monday announced a $ 48-per-share tender offer for <ORGANIZATION> Pepperell </ORGANIZATION> stock. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Point-Pepperell </LOCATION>, the nation's largest publicly owned textile and apparel company, has not responded, advising stockholders to await a board recommendation that is promised by next week. However, employees were informed of the severance program Tuesday. <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Roark </PERSON>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Point-Pepperell </LOCATION> vice president of human resources, said Wednesday the program had been adopted last week and was under consideration for some time. `` This is not something we did in response to <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Farley </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Roark </PERSON> said. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Farley </PERSON> heads the conglomerate which owns underwear manufacturer Fruit of the Loom and other companies. `` We had been talking -LRB- about the plan -RRB- in the management group for several months,'' <PERSON> Roark </PERSON> said in a telephone interview from the company's <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Point </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ga. </LOCATION>, headquarters. `` This was not, and we do n't now consider it, ` shark repellent,''' he said, referring to jargon used to describe tactics companies use to fend off corporate raiders. A <PERSON> Farley </PERSON> spokesman said the company would have no comment on the provision. <PERSON> Roark </PERSON> said the plan _ which guarantees at least three-months pay to some 5,900 salaried and clerical employees _ would not involve enough money to dissuade a suitor. However, he had no estimate on the amount of money involved, saying it would depend on how many employees were involved and their level of seniority. The decision, however, fits in with a series of moves <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Point-Pepperell </LOCATION> has taken this year to strengthen its ability to fight a takeover. In June, the company adopted a shareholder rights plan which would allow the board to issue a special class of stock as a dividend to current stockholders. The plan would take effect as soon as a tender offer is launched or if someone purchases 10 percent of its stock. <PERSON> Farley </PERSON> notified the company in May it was seeking up to 25 percent of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Point-Pepperell </LOCATION> stock and so far has spent $ 88 million for 9.8 percent of the stock. <LOCATION> Pepperell </LOCATION> also has had in place for some time so-called `` golden parachutes'' for executives, including a $ 1.39 million payout to Chief Executive Officer <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lanier </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> if he were to be fired by new owners. Those provisions have been challenged by <PERSON> Farley </PERSON> in federal court and by a <LOCATION> Pepperell </LOCATION> stockholder, who filed a suit in state <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Tuesday, claiming stockholders are deprived of the highest possible stock price. No action has been taken on either lawsuit. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Point-Pepperell </LOCATION> is one of the first companies in the state to take advantage of a new state antitakeover law adopted earlier this year and patterned after similar laws in other states. The law, which took effect in March, limits a new owner's ability to sell off parts of the company for five years. The severance plan covers all salaried and certain skilled clerical workers, who <PERSON> Roark </PERSON> said in other places in the country likely would be salaried workers. `` If within two years of a change of control, an employee covered by the plan is terminated, they would receive the greater of two weeks pay per year of service or three months' pay,'' <PERSON> Roark </PERSON> said. `` It institutionalizes the sort of severance payment that we consider fair and reasonable in any event. It's about what we do now,'' he said. `` We felt that is was important that if we did change control ... some provision be in place to insure that -LRB- employees -RRB- were treated as fair by the new management as we would.''

 <ORGANIZATION> Trans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday reported increases in their third-quarter profit from a year earlier, while <ORGANIZATION> USAir </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>'s net income was reduced by merger costs. New York-based <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> said its net income in the three months ended Sept. 30 jumped 54.4 percent to $ 88 million, or $ 2.39 a share, from $ 57.1 million, or $ 1.41 a share, a year earlier. Third-quarter revenue was up 4.9 percent to $ 1.27 billion from $ 1.21 billion. <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's seventh-largest airline, was taken private on Monday by its chairman and owner, <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON>. Lawsuits against the privatization have been filed by some <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> shareholders and the pilots union at the airline. In addition, the union representing <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> flight attendants has asked the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> to block the privatization and freeze the airline's assets while it investigates <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON>'s fitness to continue managing <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> The <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> pilots union joined the flight attendants' petition, and the <ORGANIZATION> Consumer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> has filed a similar petition with the DOT. <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> General Counsel <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Buckstein </PERSON> said recently that the carrier plans to lease or buy about 60 new aircraft to upgrade its aging fleet, at a cost of up to $ 1.5 billion. In the first nine months of the year, <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION>'s profit more than doubled _ to $ 132.7 million, or $ 2.89 a share, from $ 55.2 million, or 45 cents a share, a year earlier. The latest nine-month profit includes a special gain of $ 49.9 million from a cash payment awarded to <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> in a long-standing lawsuit against its former owner, the late <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> management's suit, originally filed in 1962, alleged that the eccentric multimillionaire failed to provide the carrier with adequate aircraft. Although a <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> court decided in <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION>'s favor last year, the payment was not made until the second quarter of 1988. Revenue in the first nine months rose 7.77 percent, to $ 3.33 billion from $ 3.09 billion. <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION>, also based in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, said its third-quarter net income edged up 6.3 percent, helped by continuing improvement in profits from its Northeast shuttle and <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> commuter operations. The eighth-largest <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> airline reported that its profit in the three months ended Sept. 30 rose to $ 67.4 million, or 47 cents a share, from $ 63.4 million, or 45 cents a share, a year earlier. Third-quarter revenue expanded 13.7 percent, to $ 1.20 billion from $ 1.06 billion. The company said the growth in revenue was boosted by strong passenger traffic. `` In fact, <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> set a new quarterly record for revenue, surpassing the levels reported during the time when the airline was operating its <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> division,'' Chairman <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Plaskett </PERSON> said. In the first nine months of the year, <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> had a net loss of $ 21.0 million, widened from a loss of $ 19.8 million a year earlier. The loss occurred despite a 16.9 percent rise in revenue for the nine months, to $ 3.18 billion from $ 2.72 billion. Washington-based <ORGANIZATION> USAir </ORGANIZATION> said its third-quarter profit was trimmed 4.5 percent by expenses related to its acquisitions of <ORGANIZATION> Piedmont </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>. The nation's ninth-biggest airline saw its net income slip to $ 68.5 million, or $ 1.58 a share, from $ 71.7 million, or $ 1.66 a share, a year earlier. The decline occurred despite an 87.3 percent jump in third-quarter revenue, to $ 1.48 billion from $ 790.8 million. In the first nine months, <ORGANIZATION> USAir </ORGANIZATION>'s profit fell to $ 142.2 million, or $ 3.28 a share, from $ 167.9 million, or $ 4.80 a share. Nine-month revenue surged to $ 4.22 billion from $ 1.87 billion.

<HEAD>Federal Judge Dismisses Grand Met Takeover Suit, Returns Case To
State Court</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 Grand Metropolitan PLC is considering appealing a federal judge's dismissal of its suit to strike down an <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> law that would bar its proposed $ 5.2 billion buyout of <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, an attorney for Grand Met said Wednesday <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Strand </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION> also has denied Grand Met's motion for a preliminary injunction to bar enforcement of the <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> state takeover law in the deal. Strand on Monday dismissed Grand Met's Oct. 4 lawsuit that contended the <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> law barring out-of-state takeovers of <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> businesses holding liquor licenses was illegal because it improperly hindered interstate commerce and infringed on federal authority over interstate securities dealings. Businesses owned by <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's fourth-largest food company, includ the <ORGANIZATION> Bennigan </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> and Steak and Ale chains. <PERSON> Bennigan </PERSON>'s has restaurants in <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Mesa </LOCATION>, and because the restaurants have liquor licenses the state liquor control superintendant must approve any takeover of them by an out-of-state company. Strand said the federal courts should defer to the state courts when action at that level is pending, important state interests are involved and the state proceedings provided `` an adequate opportunity to raise the federal questions.'' <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> MacDonnell </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION> lawyer representing Grand Metropolitan, said the company was considering an appeal of Strand's decision Grand Metropolitan, one of the world's biggest producers of spirits, has said it would sell off <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Steak </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Ale and <ORGANIZATION> Bennigan </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> restaurants because of laws in a number of states prohibiting a liquor producer from owning retail liquor outlets. Grand Met filed its suit the same day it offered to buy <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION> for $ 60 a share. <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION> since then has rejected the offer as inadequate, and indicated it would present its shareholders with an alternative to the British food, liquor and real estate conglomerate by next Tuesday. <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION> stock closed at $ 60.62 -LCB-, up $ 1.50 a share from Tuesday's close, on Wednesday in <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> trading. The Minneapolis-based company's board of directors reportedly met on Wednesday, although <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION> declined to comment on the reports and <PERSON> Johnny </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION>'s vice president of public relations, said the company had nothing to announce. <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION> also filed a lawsuit Oct. 4, in <ORGANIZATION> Maricopa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, claiming Grand Metropolitan's takeover attempt should be blocked because it violates <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>'s Acquisition of Control Act. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mais </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION> lawyer representing <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION>, said Wednesday that he expects both sides to file motions quickly in the state case but nothing had been scheduled.

<HEAD>Largest Caterpillar Local Says Yes To New Contract</HEAD>
<DATELINE>EAST PEORIA, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The largest union local representing workers at <ORGANIZATION> Caterpillar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> approved a tentative labor contract Wednesday, virtually assuring ratification of the three-year deal covering 17,500 employees in five states. Seventy-four percent of the members of <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Auto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Local </ORGANIZATION> 974 who voted in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peoria </LOCATION> supported the tentative agreement while 26 percent opposed it, said local President <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Green </PERSON>. He said he could not give actual vote totals for Local 974, which has 10,033 members. Caterpillar spokesman <PERSON> Gil </PERSON> <PERSON> Nolde </PERSON> declined to comment on the vote. The tentative contract, worked out late last Friday by union and company bargainers, includes a 3 percent wage increase and lump-sum bonuses of about 3 percent. It affects workers in plants at 12 cities in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>. Another major provision is 100 percent job security to 85 percent of the current workforce. Other provisions call for improved pension benefits, early retirement allowances and night shift bonuses. Ratification votes are scheduled this weekend in <LOCATION> Pontiac </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Aurora </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>. Peoria-based <ORGANIZATION> Caterpillar </ORGANIZATION>, the world's largest manufacturer of earth-moving equipment, is piling up the best sales and profits in its 63-year history. Executives say 1988 could be the most profitable, eclipsing 1981 when the company earned $ 578 million. The company's union workers now earn an average of $ 14.61 per hour, or $ 30,388 per year.

<TEXT>
 S.B. <PERSON> Fuller </PERSON>, known as the dean of black entrepreneurs after he built a door-to-door cosmetics company into a national company with more than 5,000 salesmen, has died at age 83. <PERSON> Fuller </PERSON> died Monday of kidney failure in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> in suburban <LOCATION> Blue </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>. `` S.B. <PERSON> Fuller </PERSON>'s success and his personal precept that an individual could achieve financial independence through self-direction and hard work greatly influenced the <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> minority business scene in the 1940s and 1950s,'' said <PERSON> Gwynne </PERSON> <PERSON> Goodlet </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Fuller </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Products </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> spokesman. At its peak in the 1960s, <ORGANIZATION> Fuller </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Products </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> included newspapers, appliance outlets and department stores, as well as farming and cattle interests. <PERSON> Fuller </PERSON>, who was unrelated to <ORGANIZATION> Fuller </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brush </ORGANIZATION> company founder <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Fuller </PERSON>, was the first black member of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturers </ORGANIZATION>. He also trained other black business people, including magazine publishers <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Ellen </PERSON> <PERSON> Schadd </PERSON> <PERSON> Strong </PERSON> and cosmetics magnate <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>. A native of <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Fuller </PERSON> left school after the sixth grade. His mother, who died when he was 17, convinced him that the best way out of poverty was door-to-door sales. After hitchhiking to <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, he became a salesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Commonwealth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. By 1934, he had become its manager In 1935, he started <ORGANIZATION> Fuller </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Products </ORGANIZATION> with $ 25 borrowed on his car, and then used door-to-door sales representatives to handle 30 items from a little-known cosmetics line. Fuller Products peaked in the 1960s with sales of $ 10 million annually and sales offices in 38 states. The company lost business the 1960s, however, to boycotts by white supremecists and also by blacks who objected to a <ORGANIZATION> Fuller </ORGANIZATION> statement that `` a lack of understanding of the capitalist system and not racial barriers was keeping blacks from making progress.'' <PERSON> Fuller </PERSON> brought the company through a bankruptcy reorganization in 1971, and reported a profit of $ 300,000 in 1972. <PERSON> Fuller </PERSON> is survived by his wife, <PERSON> Lestine </PERSON>, and five daughters. Burial services were scheduled Friday in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>.
