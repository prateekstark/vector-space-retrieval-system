<TEXT>
 The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration appealed to a powerless government in exile for permission to board a Panamanian freighter off Key West and was readily accommodated, leading to the seizure of 3,359 pounds of cocaine, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> explained Friday. `` Can you tell us which government gave the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> permission, <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s or the Panamanian government we recognize in exile?'' a reporter asked during the daily <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> briefing. `` The Department of State requested permission from the <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> government through the <ORGANIZATION> Panamanian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> and Ambassador <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Sosa </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, and permission was granted,'' spokesman <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Boucher </PERSON> responded. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> recognizes <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Arturo </PERSON> <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> as the legitimate president of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> was ousted from the office in February 1988 at the urging of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s de facto ruler, Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, indicted by a grand jury in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> on drug trafficking charges, also overturned the results of the May 7 election, which showed an opposition candidate as the winner. <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> was not a candidate. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> responded to the election fraud by sending in American troops to bolster the 10,000 or so soldiers already there, withdrawing the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassador and cutting the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Embassy staff. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> boarded the Panamanian freighter Thursday night and found the hidden sacks of cocaine. Transportation Secretary <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> put the street value of the drugs at $ 129.5 million. Adm. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Yost </PERSON> boarded the 162-foot captured freighter at <LOCATION> Key </LOCATION> <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> on Friday and praised the interception, saying: `` What this means is that we have begun to coerce the smuggler back out on the sea, and out of the air.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Customs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said the ship's position, off the direct route to the <LOCATION> Dominican </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>, aroused suspicion. But an initial search of ship failed to turn up anything, officials said. `` The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> went to the <ORGANIZATION> Panamanian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, and we were given approval to go ahead and board the ship,'' <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> Lt. <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Karonis </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, government authorities said Friday they were satisfied that the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> had captured a drug-running vessel but were upset that <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> had gotten permission from the <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> government. `` We are very happy that the Americans have made this capture,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Carrera </PERSON> of the prosecutor's office. He added, `` We are annoyed about the manner'' that they sought permission. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> have had an anti-drug agreement since 1976 which mandates cooperation from both sides. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, a reporter at the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> briefing pressed the issue: `` Is the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>' view that the <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> government in exile has the authority to grant permission for interception of a ship? Is the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>' view that the <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> government in exile has the authority to grant permission for any sort of military or paramilitary activity such as the use of <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> forces to stop shipping to and from <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>?'' <PERSON> Boucher </PERSON> said: `` If we decide we're going to try to board the vessel, we go to the government and get permission. We certainly do recognize the <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> government as the government of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, and we recognize, therefore, that they have the authority to give us permission, and then we board the vessel.''

<TEXT>
 It's not exactly all work and no play, but many who live in the Soviet bloc nations of <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> say they rarely have either the time or money for recreation. `` It is hard to have free time in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>,'' said a woman who held a child in each hand as she left a market hall in central <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION>. `` We have to stand on line and there is nothing in the stores.'' Romanians often spend up to five hours a day waiting in line for food because much of the food produced there is exported. `` Practically, I have no leisure time _ with work, the home, the kids,'' a <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> businessman said. Some Eastern Europeans work as many as three jobs. An air traffic controller in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> might also work as a nightclub bouncer, or a university teacher might moonlight as an exterminator. While stores and markets in <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> are well-stocked with fresh produce and meat, other consumer items and appliances are in short supply. Hungarians have grown accustomed to working as long as 16 hours a day to provide needed services. <PERSON> Ibolya </PERSON> <PERSON> Kuzsel </PERSON>, a Hungarian woman with a 12-year-old daughter, has run her husband's workshop since he died last year. Kuzsel rises at 5:30 each morning to do her chores before work; her evenings are spent on the accounting. Saturdays, she goes to the cemetery. `` I have little time for my daughter,'' she said. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will spend four days in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, the first visit to the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact nations by an American president since 1977. Many Eastern Europeans find inexpensive recreation in television or weekend trips to the country. And statistics show that alcohol is a popular escape, despite attempts throughout the bloc to curb its use. Hungarians spend an average of one month's salary on alcohol each year. That nation has the highest alcohol-related cirrhosis mortality rate in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> is second. Western television, especially popular detective series, provides diversion. Those in <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> who can afford it can buy satellite dishes to pick up Western stations. Soviet television provides variety for some residents of <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION>. Weekend houses or bungalows are popular for residents of <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. But even weekends mean work. `` We just harvested 100 kilos -LRB- 220 pounds -RRB- of cherries and 400 kilos -LRB- 880 pounds -RRB- of green beans,'' said a young Hungarian entrepreneur who spends her work week in her tiny toy shop in <LOCATION> Budapest </LOCATION>. She will can the garden produce for the winter. Real vacations are often too costly for most Eastern Europeans to even consider. A week's vacation in a modest setting for a Polish family of four could cost three times the average monthly salary. Liberalized travel laws are allowing Hungarians more access to the West, with reasonably priced bus tours to <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> costing about $ 210. The state travel agency also offers more exclusive trips, such as a three-week vacation to <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> for $ 4,840.

<TEXT>
 Abortion advocates have staked out <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> for the first true test of their punch at the polls, saying they'll hit the hustings and slug it out on the airwaves in an all-out effort to elect a pro-choice Democrat as governor. `` Abortion is going to be smack dab in the middle of this election,'' said <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Bowker </PERSON>, state chief of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Women </ORGANIZATION>. With so few political races this year, `` we are going to be the target state,'' she said. This week's upheaval in abortion law has jarred other 1989 campaigns, particularly the <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> gubernatorial and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> mayoral elections. But it is in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> that the issue has risen quickly to the political fore. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>'s race, like <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>'s, pits an anti-abortion Republican against a pro-choice Democrat. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, pro-choice Democratic Mayor <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> is attacking the neutral stand of Republican <PERSON> Rudolph </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON>. `` People who believe in a woman's right to abortion ... ought to be fearful of <PERSON> Rudy </PERSON> <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> has said. A <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON> aide on Wednesday accused the mayor of fearmongering. <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> began his attacks on the issue months ago, but abortion gained new prominence as a political issue Monday, when the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> approved of greater abortion restrictions by the states. Pro-choice groups promptly pledged to fight new anti-abortion laws and to work for the election of candidates who favor legal abortion. `` In every race, we will attempt to make the right to abortion the major issue,'' declared NOW President <PERSON> Molly </PERSON> <PERSON> Yard </PERSON>. The outcome is uncertain. National polls have indicated that few voters cast their ballots solely on the issue of abortion, and those who do split about evenly on both sides of the debate. However, given the court's ruling, `` We're dealing with a whole different environment,'' said <PERSON> Janice </PERSON> <PERSON> Ballou </PERSON>, polling director for the <ORGANIZATION> Eagleton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rutgers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Brunswick </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION> `` All those people in the middle are the ones that this change might impact.'' In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Eagleton </PERSON> polling before the ruling found 23 percent support for more restrictions on abortion _ and 68 percent opposing restrictions. Moreover, many more abortion supporters held their views strongly. That is promising for Democratic gubernatorial nominee <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Florio </PERSON>, who has pledged to veto any abortion restrictions. And it may trouble Republican <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Courter </PERSON>, who has favored outlawing abortion except in most cases. `` If we can have a big win for <PERSON> Florio </PERSON>, that makes a big statement,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Bowker </PERSON>. `` And if we can do well in the Assembly races, that makes an even bigger statement.'' Her plan of attack: A hit list of abortion opponents in the state Assembly, a series of pro-choice rallies across the state, radio advertising criticizing <PERSON> Courter </PERSON> on the issue _ and two new telephone lines at NOW state headquarters in <LOCATION> Trenton </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Courter </PERSON>, for his part, is playing down abortion's significance, with an aide saying Wednesday he does not see it as a central issue in the November election. In <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, pro-choice advocates say Democratic gubernatorial nominee <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON>'s support for legal abortion has been equivocal; for example, he opposes public funding for abortion in most cases. <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON> faces Republican <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON>, who opposes legalized abortion. `` It seems to me that if <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON>'s going to win he has got to be much stronger on the issue of women's reproductive rights,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Yard </PERSON>, in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. `` I think he's been scared by it. Nobody wins by being scared.'' In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, the issue has been raised mainly by <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> against <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON>, the front-runner in the polls. <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> has had the city pay for abortions for poor women who have no other source of funds. He says <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON>, who opposes abortion personally, can not be trusted to continue the program. But <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Perkins </PERSON>, <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON>'s spokesman, said <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON> would continue the abortion funding despite his personal beliefs. Said <PERSON> Perkins </PERSON>: `` The mayor is spreading disniformation to try to heighten the fears of women.'' Abortion, he said, `` is not a mayoral issue.''

<DATELINE>YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK, Wyo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Howling wolves have n't been heard in Yellowstone National Park for decades, but even talk about them is enough to rile the ranchers and others surrounding the park The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>'s program to educate students across the country about the role of the wolf in the wild has raised fears by some that it could lead to the predator's return to <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION>'s 2.2 million acres `` Wolves are fascinating animals and when you talk to people about them, you never get a ho-hum reaction. They always have a strong reaction one way or another,'' said <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Zarki </PERSON>, a ranger in <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION>'s Naturalist Division. `` They come with quite a bit of emotional baggage. We are trying to put some information in the hands of teachers and students: what -LRB- wolves -RRB- do, what their behavior is and what sort of role they have in the ecology,'' he said. `` It is not designed to sell a particular point of view, it is supposed to give them information so they can make up their minds on their own.'' Sen. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON>, R-Wyo., is among those who see the wolf awareness program as a way to drum up support for the wolf's return to <LOCATION> Yellowstone </LOCATION> `` There is no other purpose for it but to promote reintroduction,'' <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON> said. `` There are guys in there who are so -LRB- heated -RRB- up and so obsessed they ca n't even see.'' Turn-of-the-century eradication efforts by ranchers drove wolves from <LOCATION> Yellowstone </LOCATION>, and in recent years there has been a drive to return the animals to the park. <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON> and the rest of the <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> congressional delegation long have opposed the plan, which has the support of <LOCATION> Yellowstone </LOCATION> officials. Those who want to return the wolves say they would prevent big-game herds from growing too large and overgrazing. <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON> and other foes fear the wolves would stray from <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION> and prey on livestock on surrounding ranches. Rep. <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Owens </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Utah </LOCATION>, has sponsored legislation that would force the <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> to study how returning the wolves to the park would affect the environment. The <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> delegation is trying to derail that effort, too. <PERSON> Owens </PERSON> brought a 13-month-old female wolf to the lawn outside the Capitol in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> last month to dramatize his campaign. The wolf awareness program is being financed by donations from the <ORGANIZATION> Natural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> History </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, several large corporations and one unidentified donor. It is meant to mesh with the park's `` Expedition Yellowstone'' program that prepares students for visits to the park. The financing bothers <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON>. `` Forget the wolf aspect,'' he said. `` The issue is it is a bad precedent for interest groups to round up the money to do anything -LRB- through the Park Service -RRB-.'' <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON> said the arrangement amounts to federal government endorsement of a program that he says unfairly stresses the benefits of having wolves in the park without examining the impact of their presence as predators. The program, launched at the urging of former <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> Director <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Penn </PERSON> <PERSON> Mott </PERSON>, is designed to teach students about the wolf and its habits, not to promote their return to <LOCATION> Yellowstone </LOCATION>, park officials say. The program teaches elementary and high school students about wolves and urges them to mimic the animals through classroom activities such as howling, which wolves use to communicate. Students also can join in the debate over the plan to return wolves to <LOCATION> Yellowstone </LOCATION> by staging a mock public meeting. `` They assume the positions of various special interest groups with parts in the debate,'' <PERSON> Zarki </PERSON> said. Not overlooked by the program is that wolves no longer lope through <LOCATION> Yellowstone </LOCATION>. `` It's not like we hide from the kids the fact the wolves are not here,'' he said. `` We try to deal with that and why. Most kids know animals are not as widespread as they used to be and people are in many cases responsible for that.'' <PERSON> Zarki </PERSON> conceded that the program may result in letters in favor of wolf reintroduction, but stressed it is not designed to do so. `` I'm not suggesting in the activities that they do that,'' he said. `` But if you look in the past ... there are many incidents where students focus on wildlife issues and write to legislators and action is taken. All we are trying to do is help kids learn a little bit more about wolves.''

 The crackdown on dissent in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> has multiplied fears that this vibrant capitalist enclave may wither under the Communist Chinese rule scheduled to begin in 1997. <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> residents watched in horror as <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> soldiers stamped out the pro-democracy movement in June, and many responded by applying for passports and demanding that <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> offer them refuge. `` It's a tragedy we have here,'' said <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Y.S </PERSON>. <PERSON> Cheng </PERSON>, a political scientist. `` To most of my friends, there are only two ways out. One is to emigrate; the other is to keep quiet, keep your fingers crossed and hope for the best.'' <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> agreed five years ago to return <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> in 1997, when the lease on much of the crown colony expires. In return, the Chinese said <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> could keep its capitalist system and enjoy a `` high degree of autonomy'' for 50 years under a policy of `` one country, two systems.'' Since then, the people of <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> have busied themselves with what they have always done best: making money. The economy achieved impressive growth that reached 13.5 percent in 1987 and brought great prosperity to many of the 5.7 million people. Economic links with <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> strengthened dramatically. Legions of <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> entrepreneurs started factories in adjacent <LOCATION> Guangdong </LOCATION> province and hundreds of Chinese companies set up shop in the territory. Such bonds increased the importance of <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s policy of modernizing and opening itself to the world, a process widely seen as the best guarantee of the `` one country, two systems'' policy Then came the night of June 3-4 in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, when the army attacked and the government acknowledged that hundreds of people were killed. The assault, and mass arrests that followed, caused hundreds of thousands in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> to shed their political apathy and take to the streets in protest. `` It has shown very clearly that there's no guarantee from <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. They are capable of doing anything,'' said <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Chan </PERSON>, a researcher at the Center of Asian Studies at the University of <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>. Many people are leaving the colony and companies are evaluating their future, said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Broadfoot </PERSON>, managing director of a business-risk consulting group. A surge in the emigration of skilled workers would cause a loss of the local investment and personnel needed for the city to grow. The government estimates 45,000 people emigrated in 1988, up from an average of 20,000 in each of the previous five years. Sharp increases in immigration inquiries and applications were reported last month by consulates of such popular destinations as <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>. Even smaller countries like <LOCATION> Jamaica </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Belize </LOCATION> found interest growing. <PERSON> Diane </PERSON> <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON>, personnel manager of a <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> shipping company, said three of its 170 employees had resigned to move abroad, four were planning to leave and 17 had started the emigration process. `` Everybody is worried about the future,'' she said. People without the money, skills or connections to go where they choose are asking <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> to provide refuge as an `` insurance policy.'' Officials in the colony say granting the right to live in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> is essential to restoring confidence among residents, many of whose families fled Communist <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> has refused. `` There is simply no way that the British government could grant to several million people the right to come and live in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>,'' Foreign Secretary Sir <PERSON> Geoffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Howe </PERSON> said on a recent visit to <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>. He said <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> would take all measures possible to safeguard the colony, and urged the people not to `` underestimate your ability to build that future.'' `` <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> has seen hard times before,'' <PERSON> Howe </PERSON> said. `` You've always shown the resilience and the resourcefulness to live through such times and emerge from them stronger than ever before. A recent poll indicated only 6 percent of residents would move to <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> if given the right, and that most people had no intention of leaving <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Chan </PERSON> said the pro-democracy movement had caused many to rediscover their Chinese identity. The political awakening in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> touched all levels of society. In addition to huge street demonstrations, a television personality organized seminars on democracy and activists collected volumes of signatures for various protests. Revulsion about the <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> crackdown was widespread, from newspapers long supported by <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> to taxi drivers who attached tiny black flags to their antennas. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, which some residents say has not done enough for the colony, appeared likely to speed democratic reform so the people would have a greater voice in their future. The legislature is dominated by government officials and appointed members. <PERSON> Cheng </PERSON>, the political scientist, has fought a long battle for more democracy but now says: `` What guarantee will it offer? If <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> is ready to crush the students with tanks and machine guns, what's the point of having a democratic system in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>? Others believe continued support in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> for <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s dissidents might be dangerous `` <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> leaders could perceive a political threat in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> that outweighs economic benefits,'' <PERSON> Broadfoot </PERSON> said. `` If <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> refuses to keep out of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s political affairs, it could be extremely damaging.'' Observers say the fall of the hard-line leadership in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, or enacting a bill of rights and redrafting the post-1997 constitution for <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> could help the territory's success extend well into the 21st century. But for now, <PERSON> Cheng </PERSON> said, `` almost everyone is very depressed.''

 <PERSON> Tan </PERSON> <PERSON> Kwang </PERSON> <PERSON> Long </PERSON> left a pharmaceutical plant, a five-story home and the good life behind in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> when the communists won the war 14 years ago and he fled to this British colony. He thought he had found a home. Then Chinese soldiers crushed pro-democracy demonstrations in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> and he started searching for a new haven. <PERSON> Nansun </PERSON> <PERSON> Shi </PERSON>, a TV producer, was `` just too busy for politics'' before the crackdown. Now she heads a group teaching <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> residents about democracy and human rights. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> is to assume control of <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> in 1997 under an agreement with <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, but the heavy-handed suppression of dissent has shocked this colony of 5.7 million and is changing the attitudes of its people. Since the Chinese army assaulted Tiananmen Square the night of June 3-4, hundreds of thousands of <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> residents have put aside political apathy and taken to the streets in protest. More than 650,000 signed a petition for democratic reforms and a bill of rights, and demanding that <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> residents be given the right to live in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. Callers to radio talk shows have proposed independence for <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, while others say it should buy some islands to accommodate its people. Some residents have started an `` underground railroad'' to get dissidents out of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Zhang </PERSON> <PERSON> Xuexin </PERSON>, a waiter at the Good Taste Restaurant in the <LOCATION> Happy </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> district, expressed the feelings of many: `` I'm terrified of what will happen when the Communists come. My whole family is; neighbors, too. `` I fled <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> during the Cultural Revolution. I swam here and risked my neck. After 1978 and <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaoping </PERSON>, I had a little hope. Then there was the massacre on <LOCATION> Tiananmen </LOCATION>. Now I know Communists will never change.'' Fear is not confined to Chinese residents. Many of the 100,000 Westerners in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> also worry. `` This is home,'' said <PERSON> Diane </PERSON> <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON>, 44. `` I've spent half my married life here. I had one of my sons here. This is where I want to be, but if we do n't leave now and it collapses around us after 1997, we might just be too old.'' Under the 1984 agreement between <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> promises to keep <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>'s capitalist system intact for 50 years after 1997. It also agreed to an unspecified degree of political `` autonomy,'' currently being negotiated. After the bloodshed in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> and ensuing mass arrests, many people in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> lost faith that <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> would keep its word. Thousands want to emigrate, but some like Ms. <PERSON> Shi </PERSON> say they are willing to stay and fight. Educated in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> as a member of a well-off <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> family, she spent her teens `` wearing bobby socks and reading Seventeen magazine.'' She returned to <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> in her 20s, got a public relations job and soon began reporting on high society for television. Later, she moved to producing movies and TV shows. `` I never was political at all,'' she said. `` I had a sense of what was right, but that covered all spheres. I just did n't think about politics. That's not what we were taught to do.'' When <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s army attacked the students, she said, `` I was ... shocked so I could n't speak, possibly because it was such a simple issue, which is so rare these days. It's so black and white. It's so clear who was right and who was wrong.'' After taking part in demonstrations, organizing a concert and working on a song for the pro-democracy movement, Ms. <PERSON> Shi </PERSON> said, it seemed to her that people knew well enough what they were protesting but not what they were fighting for. `` We were shouting ` democracy,' ` freedom,' ` human rights,' but nobody knew what that meant,'' she said. `` I figured I had to find out.'' The result was a series of seminars on the topic by leading <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> academics. <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Lau </PERSON>, a nurse who attended a recent Sunday of lectures at the <ORGANIZATION> Hong </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kong </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Teachers </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, said the program opened her mind. `` It made me want to educate myself,'' she said, holding a filled notebook. `` Our system teaches us how to be good workers, but not good thinkers.'' <PERSON> Wang </PERSON> <PERSON> Qiao </PERSON>, a 65-year-old taxi driver who fled <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION> in 1954, said the crackdown in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> `` woke people up. It taught the young people about the Communists.'' `` They said the same thing in <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION> in the 1950s: ` You can stay capitalist; we need your help,' all that stuff,'' he said. `` Then they came in and took the factories away and locked up the capitalists. It's going to be the same story here.'' Tan, the pharmacist, said his South Vietnamese passport will make moving more difficult. `` It gets so maddening,'' he said. `` I struggled here for 10 years and finally am making a little money in real estate. Then this happens, the market goes soft and my wife starts telling me it's time to find a new country.

<HEAD>Former Candidate for Haitian Presidency Arrested in Bank Scam</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A Haitian exile who ran for president of his island nation in 1987 was arrested Thursday on charges he operated a bogus bank that may have bilked customers out of tens of millions of dollars, a federal prosecutor said. <PERSON> Clemard </PERSON> <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Charles </PERSON>, who was granted asylum in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> nine years ago, and three others purported to run the <ORGANIZATION> Banque </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerciale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> D'Haiti </ORGANIZATION> from a home in <LOCATION> Queens </LOCATION> and a mortgage company from a luxury apartment overlooking Central Park in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>, authorities said. Neither concern was authorized to operate in the state. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Maloney </PERSON> said the victims of the scheme, which ran for about two years, ranged from drug dealers to international financiers. `` What makes this operation so unusual was the brazenness, the chutzpah,'' <PERSON> Maloney </PERSON> said. `` They never moved out of a location, they never left town. That makes it a little extraordinary.'' Investigators will not know how many people and financial institutions were cheated and how much money the scams earned until records seized by <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents during raids Thursday are examined, <PERSON> Maloney </PERSON> said. The bank apparently cheated its customers out of tens of millions of dollars, said Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gerber </PERSON>, adding `` we do n't really have a handle on it.'' In one complex transaction, the bank recently issued bogus multimillion-dollar letters of credit payable to the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> and the economic ministries of <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Maloney </PERSON> said. The letters of credit for $ 2 million each from the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> and the two countries were used to finance the campaign of a politician from the <LOCATION> Dominican </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION>'s neighbor on the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> island of <LOCATION> Hispaniola </LOCATION>, according to <PERSON> Maloney </PERSON>. According to court papers, the scheme began to unravel last October when <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Westminster </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION> attempted to regain losses on a $ 5 million letter of credit issued by <ORGANIZATION> Banque </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commercial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> D'Haiti </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Maloney </PERSON> said he could not yet explain how the phony bankers had managed to continue to operate without detection or retaliation. Authorities said <PERSON> Charles </PERSON>, 66, came to this country in 1980 after he was freed from a Haitian jail where he spent 10 years for opposing former President <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> `` Papa Doc'' <PERSON> Duvalier </PERSON>. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> was one of 35 presidential candidates in the violently aborted Nov. 29, 1987 general elections. If convicted of bank fraud and other charges, <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> and the others would face at least 10 years in jail, heavy fines and forfeiture of property purchased with their earnings, <PERSON> Maloney </PERSON> said. He identified the other suspects, all listed as officials of the bank, as <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Aye </PERSON>, 74; <PERSON> Charles </PERSON>' son, <PERSON> Victor </PERSON>, 43, and <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Hall </PERSON>, 50. All are from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Aye </PERSON> was freed on a $ 100,000 secured bond, but <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Magistrate <PERSON> Carol </PERSON> <PERSON> Bagley </PERSON> <PERSON> Amon </PERSON> ordered the others held pending a hearing on Tuesday.

She was swept under the water when she attempted to reach higher ground. `` You could n't tell how deep the water was,'' Motes said. `` She fell in up to her shoulders and was smiling, then she disappeared.'' <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, who was watching the photo session, jumped in after Miss <PERSON> Shockley </PERSON>. `` When he jumped in, I noticed she'd washed up on the other side -LRB- of the culvert -RRB-,'' Motes said. `` It just happened so quickly.'' By then, <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> had been slammed against the culvert and was pinned by the current.

 Attorneys for photographer <PERSON> Ansel </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>' estate argued in federal court Thursday that publishers of a book of <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>' pictures taken for the federal government during World War II engaged in false advertising They sought to ban the sale of a calendar and desk reference book based on the same material, which is entitled, `` The Mural Project'' and said the book publishers wrongly used <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>' name to sell their book. Attorney <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Mustin </PERSON>, representing the trustees of the <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> estate, said the trustees did not publish the pictures in question because they felt the quality was not representative of <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>' work. The publishers `` are in it for the money,'' <PERSON> Mustin </PERSON> argued. `` The trustees are in it for the reputation of <PERSON> Ansel </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>. My clients want to preserve the integrity and quality of the work. But attorney <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wallen </PERSON>, representing <ORGANIZATION> Day </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dream </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Publishing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Barbara </LOCATION>, said the only reason the quality of the pictures is not good is because the negatives are unavailable. The authors of `` The Mural Project'' <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Armor </PERSON> and <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, claim the negatives are being hidden by the trustees. The pictures themselves are in the public domain and can be purchased from the government for about $ 10 apiece. They were shot in 1941 and 1942 when <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> was working for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, photographing park scenes to be blown up for murals in public buildings. The murals were never made. <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Ickes </PERSON> had hired <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> for $ 22.22 a day plus expenses, and the photos became government property. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Keller </PERSON> said there is no dispute that the photos are in the public domain and <PERSON> Mustin </PERSON> said the trustees are not challenging publication of the book itself. `` We are not challenging the book in these proceedings because we understand it is already in the stream of commerce,'' he said. `` The toothpaste is out of the tube.'' But they seek to stop distribution of the calendar and datebook and further use of <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>' name in advertising. The ad in question described the photos as `` The finding of an unknown body of work by <PERSON> Ansel </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>'' and compared it to the discovery of `` an unknown play by <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Shakespeare </PERSON>, an unknown symphony by <PERSON> Beethoven </PERSON>.'' The trustees claimed this was misleading. But the judge disagreed. `` The fact is that this was and is a commissioned body of work and it was not available until the ferreting out by Armor and <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>,'' he said. `` I'm not inclined to believe from a practical standpoint that this is misleading advertising.'' The legal arguments on further points of dispute were continued until Friday afternoon. The judge said he would take the matter under submission before issuing a ruling.

 A man who asked to be excused to use the restroom and disappeared before the start of his murder trial has been convicted in absentia. Prosecutor <PERSON> Claudia </PERSON> <PERSON> Koenig </PERSON> said sentencing will be put off until the defendant, <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Howell </PERSON>, is found. Defense lawyer <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Houlon </PERSON> said he will base an appeal on Circuit Judge <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> McCullough </PERSON>'s insistence on proceeding with a jury trial. `` I told the judge I did n't have a prayer of getting a not-guilty verdict because the jury would n't look kindly on his absence,'' said <PERSON> Houlon </PERSON>. <PERSON> McCullough </PERSON> ruled that only the defendant could waive his right to a trial by his peers. In <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>, trials in absentia are `` extremely rare,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON>, chief of criminal trials in the state attorney's office `` There have been a few minor cases, but I'm not aware of any murder cases.'' <PERSON> Howell </PERSON>, a Jamacian citizen who lived in <LOCATION> Glenarden </LOCATION>, was convicted of killing <PERSON> Collin </PERSON> <PERSON> Phelmin </PERSON> <PERSON> Branford </PERSON>, 31, in a dispute over drugs. <PERSON> Howell </PERSON>'s trial on murder and handgun charges began June 28, one day after he fled.

 Prosecutors are considering possible criminal action in the loss of $ 2 million of federal housing funds in <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> that apparently were used to buy luxury items such as a Mercedes, a speedboat, jewelry and furs. <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> documents obtained by The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> allege that <PERSON> Montgomery </PERSON> real estate broker <PERSON> Cy </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> spent the money over a three-year period by using a stack of blank wire transfer authorization forms. <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Birmingham </LOCATION> office, without a system to double-check on the receipt of funds from <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> closings, thought the $ 2 million from 63 sales closings went to its central office account, according to agency records. In fact, the money was in a <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alabama </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> account controlled solely by <PERSON> Walker </PERSON>, according to a <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> audit. Housing officials in <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> tightened controls over <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> money on Nov. 9, 1987, after they discovered the money was missing. That same day <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> closed out the First <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> account, withdrawing the last $ 136.54. The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> has turned its investigative file over to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney for possible prosecution. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> said he plans to meet with <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> officials this month to discuss possible criminal cases. Officials with <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alabama </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Montgomery </LOCATION> declined comment on specific allegations in the case. However, bank official <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> said it appeared that <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alabama </ORGANIZATION> `` has done nothing wrong, nothing out of the ordinary.'' AP interviews and <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> records, including canceled checks, show some of the money was spent by <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> for the following purchases: _ A $ 50,000 Mercedes <PERSON> Laurens </PERSON> <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> Jack </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ingram </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Montgomery </LOCATION>, said salesmen recall that <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> bought a Mercedes 560 SL convertible. The <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> audit listed nearly $ 180,000 in checks written by <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> to car dealers. _ An $ 18,870 speedboat from <LOCATION> Kowaliga </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Marina </LOCATION> The office manager at the marina said <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> bought a Stingray _ `` the Cadillac of speedboats,'' she said. _ $ 21,000 was paid to High School Video Memories, a business enterprise in which <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> hoped to sell video yearbooks to high school pupils across <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>. The venture apparently folded. Also, he is accused of spending $ 5,246 on jewelry, $ 8,255 on furs, $ 9,571 on travel and $ 2,200 for a saltwater aquarium and accessories. <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> is trying to recover the money through administrative procedures. A <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> audit covering August 1984 to November 1987 indicated some of the money in <PERSON> Walker </PERSON>'s account also was spent on HUD-related expenses such as grass-cutting and maintenance on foreclosed homes, as well as attorney's closing fees. The wire transfer forms were provided by an apparently unwitting bank employee, according to documents. A memo written by <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lunsford </PERSON>, acting manager of the <LOCATION> Birmingham </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> office in November 1987, said the forms led the office to believe the bank had wired the money properly to the agency's central office. At the time, the agency had no procedure in place to check whether it had received the money or not. <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> handled sales of <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION>'s foreclosed homes in the <LOCATION> Montgomery </LOCATION> area while he was an associate broker for <PERSON> Rick </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Lind-Davis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Real </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Estate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. The firm was sold in 1986 to <PERSON> Johnny </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Portis </PERSON>, who closed business operations last year. His attorney said <PERSON> Portis </PERSON> was not aware of what <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> was doing with the <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> money. <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> did not return a phone call made to the recording device on his beeper telephone. The number listed for his residence phone has been disconnected and <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> has moved from the apartment listed in the current phone book. <ORGANIZATION> Montgomery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Real </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Estate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> records show that he still has a valid real estate license, but it is listed as `` inactive status'' because he has not been associated with a real estate firm since Nov. 14, 1988.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is rejecting Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s latest proposal for reducing nuclear arsenals in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, saying he does n't `` want to get off track'' and challenge hard-won <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> unity. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> says he will stand by a <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> plan, which he orchestrated, that calls for conventional troop reductions first. Talks with the Soviets on cutting short-range nuclear warheads would come later, under the formula endorsed by the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> in May. As he prepared for next week's trip to <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, the president told reporters on Thursday he was not concerned with the Soviet leader's popularity in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, declaring: `` We're not going to get into the international poll business. Meanwhile, <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> reported today that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has decided to propose a 25 percent pay increases for top career government employees, with as much as a tripling for a small number of key specialists. He has endorsed a similar raise for federal judges. White House spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said Thursday night the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> expected to announce the president's decisions today, although he could not confirm the figures. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on Thursday issued a fresh challenge to <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> to remove <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> troops from <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s initial call, made last week in an interview with Polish reporters, was dismissed by <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> as political propaganda. `` It's not political; it's a visceral feeling I have on the question,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. He conceded <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> had voiced `` a lack of enthusiasm'' toward his troop withdrawal proposal. But he added, `` He's just taken troops out of <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>. And who would have said two years ago that would happen? We salute that ... I think it would be nice to aspire to that kind of situation where he would n't feel troops were necessary.'' In his meeting with reporters, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also: _ Said he was `` happy'' that former White House aide <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON> was not sentenced to prison, but declined to comment further on <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s sentence Wednesday to a $ 150,000 fine, a three-year suspended sentence, two years' probation and 1,200 hours of community service for his role in the Iran-Contra affair _ <LOCATION> Challenged </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and other Soviet bloc countries to follow the lead of <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> in moving toward more democracy, saying: `` come along with the flow. _ Said he would press for a `` broad tactics'' international effort to clean up the environment at next week's economic summit in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, saying efforts should be focused on `` preventing pollution at the outset, rather than cleaning it up afterwards. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will travel to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> on Sunday as he begins a four-nation visit to <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> that also will include stops in <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> for the seven-nation summit of industrial democracies, and in the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, in a speech Thursday in <LOCATION> Strasbourg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, said the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> would make unilateral cuts in its nuclear missiles pointed toward western <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> if the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would agree to speedy talks on reducing short-range nuclear weapons on both sides in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration officials suggested the <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> offer was designed to test <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> unity. In May, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> won allied support for a proposal for reducing both <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact conventional forces to 275,000 per side. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> went along after initially resisting <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> efforts to deal with troop reductions before grappling with the nuclear issue. `` I do n't want to get off track by reopening the <ORGANIZATION> SNF </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- short-range nuclear forces -RRB- issue when we have a good package that has wide support,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. The president said he has no plans to `` go one up'' with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> when he visits eastern <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> or to `` try to establish a popularity level in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>. That's not what sound foreign policy is about.'' `` I am delighted that he enjoys popularity in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. I am delighted when he goes to <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. I am pleased when he goes to <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>. It is good for world peace when he takes those trips. And I expect he will be delighted when I go to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and when I go to <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, for we will be well received in those countries.'' Later Thursday, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told a White House symposium on <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> he will urge <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> allies to join in an aid package for the Polish and Hungarian economies. However, he indicated <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> resources are limited, and that the two nations must primarily help themselves by reforming their own economies.

 As Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> was heralding improved East-West relations in <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION> recently, <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> was exhorting its young people to defend socialism `` with weapons'' if necessary. <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s aging leadership is growing increasingly uneasy over the momentum of reforms in other <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact countries, and over the warming of relations between the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. `` <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s leaders are n't having a very good time right now,'' said <PERSON> Heinz </PERSON> <PERSON> Timmermann </PERSON>, a foreign affairs expert at <LOCATION> Cologne </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> European and International Studies `` Everywhere they look there are changes going on that threaten them,'' <PERSON> Timmermann </PERSON> said, referring to political and economic reforms in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s state media gave scant attention to <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s June visit to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, where he was enthusiastically received by citizens Better relations between <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> mean more headaches for <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>, which has suffered for years from an identity crisis in the shadow of its prosperous western neighbor. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s popularity in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> also has posed increasing problems as public dissatisfaction mounts over the lack of reforms in the nation. Many East Germans look to <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> in the hope that he can help bring change to their rigidly controlled society. But <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>, once the <ORGANIZATION> Kremlin </ORGANIZATION>'s staunchest ideological ally, has begun a campaign to reinforce its orthodox communist views and has vehemently attacked advocates of change at home and abroad. While <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> was being feted in <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Margot </PERSON> <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON>, <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s education minister and the wife of the party <PERSON> Erich </PERSON> <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON>, urged the nation's youth to be prepared to fight for socialism. `` This is a time of struggle,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON> told delegates attending an education congress in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>. `` The times need a generation of young people who are willing to struggle to defend socialism ... with weapons in their hands if necessary.'' East German leaders promptly defended <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s June 3-4 crackdown on the pro-democracy movement, saying violence was necessary to stop a `` counterrevolutionary overthrow of people's power in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>.'' Security forces beat and detained demonstrators who tried to deliver petitions to the <ORGANIZATION> Chinese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> to protest the crackdown. In a rare public attack against a fellow <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact nation, East German officials denounced political and economic reforms in <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Joachim </PERSON> <PERSON> Herrmann </PERSON>, a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s policy-making <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said, `` The developments in <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> fill us with great concern.'' `` Under the flag of ` renewing socialism,' forces are at work that strive for the removal of socialism,'' <PERSON> Herrmann </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and opposition groups have agreed to hold multiparty elections by next summer, and the country has embarked on bold economic reforms, including more cooperation with the West. <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> is equally troubled by political developments in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. State media have largely ignored Solidarity's stunning victories last month over Communist candidates. The ruling Politburo also has stepped up its campaign against would-be reformers in the East German party's ranks. In one of the sharpest official rebukes in a decade, the Politburo denounced <LOCATION> Dresden </LOCATION>'s party leadership as `` ineffective in controlling hostile bourgeois activities.'' <LOCATION> Dresden </LOCATION>'s party chief, <PERSON> Hans </PERSON> <PERSON> Modrow </PERSON>, is considered sympathetic to <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s program of economic reforms and glasnost. There also are signs the East German government fears that public dissatisfaction over the lack of changes in its society could lead to violent street protests. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Morgenpost </ORGANIZATION> newspaper reported on June 30 that <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> had nearly doubled the strength of its elite riot control force. Travel restrictions, long in force for visits to the West, also are being imposed for trips to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>. West German news reports have said <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> is increasingly reluctant to extradite East Germans if they flee to <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>. The Hungarians have begun dismantling some border barriers with <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>, making it easier for East Germans to flee to the West than over the heavily fortified border between <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> is fanning the embers, trying to keep <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s peace plan alive as the only feasible way of encouraging negotiations with Palestinian Arabs. But even before Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> bowed to pressure on his right and set tough conditions for elections on the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>, the outlook for success was not bright. The <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, whose implicit support is essential, had denounced the plan as a ploy to block a Palestinian state. Other Arabs were less than enthusiastic as well. And while the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration supports <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s approach, it does so only on practical grounds. After decades of frustration, the idea is to get Israelis and Arabs to talk about the future of the territories on the theory that negotiations develop their own momentum, leading sometimes to startling results. Under President <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>'s persistent mediation, for instance, <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> Prime Minister <PERSON> Menachem </PERSON> <PERSON> Begin </PERSON> agreed at Camp David in 1978 to give up all of Sinai, its airfields and his country's only oil resources in exchange for peace with <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> Begin, like <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>, had the reputation of being a hard-liner. But for the sake of peace with the largest Arab country Begin gave up all the land and forced Israeli settlers to abandon their homes and towns in the desert. The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> may have had this history in mind when it tried Thursday to smooth over the conditions <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> agreed to a day earlier in <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION> at the nudging of <ORGANIZATION> Ariel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sharon </ORGANIZATION> and other <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> hard-liners. Seeking to draw a distinction between a political party's declaration and a government position, spokesman <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Boucher </PERSON> emphasized that the election plan was approved in May by the Israeli Cabinet He said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was dealing with the Israeli government, and not with a political party whose partisan declarations do not advance the peace process, `` particularly if they appear to be more restrictive or impose conditions.'' The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> spokesman urged Palestinians to participate in the election after fleshing out the details with the Israelis. But in <LOCATION> Tunis </LOCATION>, where the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> has its headquarters, a spokesman said <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s terms slammed the door on the peace process. `` These efforts now face total failure,'' <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdul-Rahman </PERSON> said. The elections would produce Palestinian leaders to negotiate five years of local self-rule for the 1.4 million Arabs who live on the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>. At the conclusion of this trial period, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> and the Palestinians would work out an overall settlement. Theoretically, all options would be open. But <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> has again ruled out a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> state _ a position, not incidentally, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> also takes. He also ruled out yielding territory or stopping Jews from settling in the areas. Moreover, the elections would be held only after violence ceased. The <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> response was to threaten an escalation of the attacks on Israeli forces that have claimed 546 Arab lives since December. `` This is the only answer to intransigence,'' <PERSON> Abdul-Rahman </PERSON> said. Even so, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> is banking on Palestinians accepting the election plan partly out of a desire to gain international acclaim _ a move that would be especially dramatic in light of <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s hard-line conditions. That would require a turnabout by the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>. Six months of semi-recognition by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> have not produced such concessions from <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s organization. Having declared his acceptance of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s right to exist and repudiating terrorism, the chairman evidently concluded that was as far as he was prepared to go. Where does this leave the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration? Apparently in the same tough spot its predecessors occupied, trying to find a formula for negotiations in the face of stiff resistance in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>. And yet, <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>'s experience at Camp David and the <LOCATION> Egyptian-Israeli </LOCATION> peace treaty are evidence that long odds can be overcome.

 Thanks to entrepreneur <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Egger </PERSON>, residents of two women's shelters in a shabby <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> neighborhood will sit down tonight to feast on salmon, tenderloin of beef, leeks, Japanese mushrooms and new potatoes, with <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> cheesecake for dessert. `` Nothing is too rich or exotic for the homeless,'' says <PERSON> Egger </PERSON>, who runs a non-profit food service for <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s street people. `` Salmon is a big hit. People love smoked fish and roast beef. Fresh strawberries are a big-ticket item. Their eyes really light up when they get strawberries.'' <PERSON> Egger </PERSON> is founder and executive director of <ORGANIZATION> D.C. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kitchen </ORGANIZATION>, a two-man operation that collects unwanted leftover food from hotels, restaurants and catering firms every day and delivers it within 24 hours to homeless shelters, soup kitchens and churches around the city. `` We're the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> food,'' says <PERSON> Egger </PERSON>. Since his refrigerator-equipped van began plying the streets last January, <PERSON> Egger </PERSON> estimates he and his partner, <PERSON> Alex </PERSON> <PERSON> Tait </PERSON>, have picked up 15 tons of unwanted food worth about $ 60,000, and provided roughly 10,000 free meals to the poor, elderly and the homeless of the capital. The salmon and roast beef leftovers that <PERSON> Egger </PERSON> picked up from a catered dinner party Wednesday night for 400 guests at the National Building Museum are standard gourmet fare on the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> party circuit. But they are rarely found in the garbage cans that many street people rummage through in search of a meal. <PERSON> Egger </PERSON> has gotten calls to pick up bags of coconut, pots of scallop creole, pans of Mexican beans and rice, bowls of pasta and octopus salad. He gets 20 to 40 leftover pizzas three times a week from one restaurant chain. When an ice cream store closed its doors near <LOCATION> Dupont </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Circle </LOCATION>, it gave him 48 five-gallon tubs of its frozen confections. Nobody knows how many of the homeless are wandering the streets of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, but estimates range from 5,000 to 15,000 people. <PERSON> Egger </PERSON> says his operation serves about 30 feeding programs around the city, with generous support from churches, foundations, corporations and charities. His lengthy list of food donors also includes corporate employee cafeterias, congressional offices on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>, various Smithsonian museums and galleries, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> bakery -LRB- where he gets day-old croissants -RRB- and scores of trade associations and lobbying groups that frequently wine and dine their clients. Every gift of giveaway food is rewarded with a tax-deduction receipt. <PERSON> Egger </PERSON>, 31, has been working in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> restaurants, nightclubs and bars since he was graduated from high school. He and his wife, <PERSON> Claudia </PERSON>, volunteered _ reluctantly at first _ for a church parish project, in collaboration with other <LOCATION> Georgetown </LOCATION> churches, to cook and deliver meals to people sleeping on steam grates in downtown <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. `` Most people think their actions do n't matter,'' <PERSON> Egger </PERSON> said, `` but I realized that with a little bit of effort, you can make a difference in people's lives. It did n't hurt. In fact, I really enjoyed it.'' After a while, <PERSON> Egger </PERSON> concluded it was a waste of money to feed the homeless `` when so much food is being thrown away.'' He began soliciting local food establishments for their leftovers. `` Then it dawned on me,'' he said. `` Why bother just to pick up and deliver food when there's this golden opportunity to train people? While we're feeding people who are waiting in line, we could train them so they can step out of the line.'' <PERSON> Egger </PERSON> is busy renovating an abandoned neighborhood cafe in a row house shared with a women's shelter. It will be the permanent home for <ORGANIZATION> D.C. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kitchen </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Egger </PERSON> plans by August to open the kitchen, where homeless trainees can learn professional food preparation and use their experience to land jobs in local hotels and restaurants. <PERSON> Egger </PERSON> dreams of owning a nightclub someday. Until then, he finds nothing quite as rewarding as feeding the homeless. `` It's like being <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Claus </LOCATION> every day you take free food to the people,'' he said.

 <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Prince </PERSON>, director of Broadway's `` The Phantom of the Opera,'' directed the new production of `` Don Giovanni'' which opened the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Opera </LOCATION>'s season. After the spectacle of `` Phantom,'' the `` <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Giovanni </PERSON>'' is surprisingly conventional. The problem is devising a set for 13 scenes changing from yard to meadow to street to ballroom to cemetery. <PERSON> Prince </PERSON> did it with pedestals that moved in and out, a footbridge added in one scene, and a balcony in a couple of them. Vocally, Thursday evening at the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> State </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Theater </LOCATION> showed the company at its best. Conductor <PERSON> Sergiu </PERSON> <PERSON> Comissiona </PERSON> and the orchestra made the music sound fresh. At the beginning of the opera, before <PERSON> Giovanni </PERSON> stabs the Commendatore, the Commendatore's statue is already on one of the pedestals. After <PERSON> Giovanni </PERSON>'s seduction of <PERSON> Donna </PERSON> <PERSON> Anna </PERSON>, he climbs down a ladder from an upper story while she runs out from the wings. Those two points were disconcerting. But from then on, except for <PERSON> Giovanni </PERSON> being unusually passive during his champagne aria, <PERSON> Prince </PERSON> did n't direct with any weird conceptions. This should be a `` <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Giovanni </PERSON>'' that will please enough people to last a long time at the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Opera </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Nova </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> made her company debut as <PERSON> Donna </PERSON> <PERSON> Anna </PERSON>, replacing <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Holleque </PERSON>, who was ill. Miss <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> made an astounding impression, her voice individual and interesting at the same time it is clear and pure Her singing was lovely throughout, conveying the pure soul of this young woman, who sometimes comes across as banal or matronly. <PERSON> Erie </PERSON> <PERSON> Mills </PERSON> made Zerlina even younger, an adolescent bride-to-be who is n't a flirt as much as so unexposed to the world that she's just dumb Miss <PERSON> Mills </PERSON>' singing, however, was poised and limpid. <PERSON> Frances </PERSON> <PERSON> Ginsberg </PERSON> also conquered as <PERSON> Donna </PERSON> <PERSON> Elvira </PERSON>, probably the hardest of the three soprano parts to make work. <PERSON> Elvira </PERSON> wants vengeance against <PERSON> Giovanni </PERSON> for leaving her. And she wants him back. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheek </PERSON> was impressive in the title role. In acting, he made <PERSON> Giovanni </PERSON> a man who has chosen to be a womanizer and pursues the ladies with enthusiasm but no unnecessary fuss. His voice is commanding though sometimes he mushed the words together. Cheek has been singing at the Metropolitan Opera, mostly in supporting parts, a status which surely will be upgraded at once. <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Opalach </PERSON> sang Leporello with effortless vocalism. He made <PERSON> Giovanni </PERSON>'s servant much younger than his master, able to jump over walls and vault to the top of pedestals. <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> <PERSON> Peterson </PERSON> made Masetto a more intelligent bridegroom than often is done. <PERSON> Nikita </PERSON> <PERSON> Storojev </PERSON>, who has been a principal singer with the <LOCATION> Bolshoi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Opera </LOCATION>, made his <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Opera </LOCATION> debut. He really sang the Commendatore, not just boom out a hollow sound. <PERSON> Jon </PERSON> <PERSON> Garrison </PERSON> presented an uptight, even precious, <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Ottavio </PERSON>, but sang the part well, with reined-in warmth. <PERSON> Rolf </PERSON> <PERSON> Langenfass </PERSON>, who created costumes for the Met's current Ring Cycle, designed the sets and costumes. Next season he'll work with <PERSON> Prince </PERSON> on a new production of `` Faust'' at the Met.

<HEAD>New Catholic Rite for Blacks Needed, Suspended Priest Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT GREENE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The Rev. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stallings </PERSON> hates the sight of empty pews, and that's one reason he wants the <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> to allow a special rite for black Americans. But a black bishop contends that <PERSON> Stallings </PERSON>, suspended as a priest for creating an unauthorized parish in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, could wind up with a church that is no different from any other evangelical congregation competing for members and dollars. <PERSON> Stallings </PERSON>, who is black, said in an interview Thursday that the Catholic church is missing the boat in attracting blacks and other minorities because its hierarchy and traditions are too bound by European culture and dominated by white males. It fails to evangelize _ make converts _ among blacks because it does n't train anyone to do so, he said, adding that other religions are filling the gap. `` I have been to cities where the church was closed,'' <PERSON> Stallings </PERSON> said. `` Black Protestants came in there and took over and now they are packed to the gills.'' <PERSON> Stallings </PERSON> said he wants to create a separate African-American Catholic Rite, along the lines of the ethnic <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rite </ORGANIZATION> churches. Those churches accept the authority of the pope, but have considerable autonomy in ritual and discipline. The unauthorized service conducted Sunday at <PERSON> Stallings </PERSON>' <ORGANIZATION> Imani </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Temple </ORGANIZATION> showed at least one side of what the new rite would entail: The service combined the traditional Catholic Mass with African ritual and the foot-stomping, hand-clapping style of the traditional black Protestant church. Baptists and <PERSON> Muslims </PERSON> also attended the service, held at <ORGANIZATION> Howard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Stallings </PERSON> was suspended the next day by <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> Cardinal <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hickey </PERSON> and barred from performing the Catholic sacraments. At stake in <PERSON> Stallings </PERSON>' battle are 2 million black American Catholics, a minority of both blacks _ some 30 million in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> _ and <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholics </ORGANIZATION> as a whole _ 54 million. According to church figures, there are 300 black priests and 13 black bishops. Of the 17,000 Catholic parishes, 1,200 are predominantly black. <PERSON> Stallings </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> church must develop `` an African-American Catholic liberation theology'' to address social and political needs. `` It is difficult, if not almost impossible, for one ethnic or cultural group to define or to decide what is good for another ethnic group,'' he said. `` It is always necessary for those ethnic groups to get a seal of approval from the white male power group.'' But Catholic officials, black and white, criticize <PERSON> Stallings </PERSON> for his methods and what they say are his unfair attacks on the church. `` The father's argument that there is racism in the church has been acknowledged,'' said Auxiliary Bishop <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ricard </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION>, who is black. `` Certainly we have a long way to go.'' Rather than defying <PERSON> Hickey </PERSON>'s authority, <PERSON> Stallings </PERSON> should work with the cardinal to form a new rite, <PERSON> Ricard </PERSON> said, adding that the danger is leading a church that is no different from any other. `` What Father <PERSON> Stallings </PERSON> is going to find is that, frankly, the ministers who can perform the preaching styles and rituals in his church are a dime a dozen,'' <PERSON> Ricard </PERSON> said, referring to the host of evangelicals crowding the airwaves. `` The Catholic priest gets his authority from a Roman collar.'' The Rev. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Lori </PERSON>, <PERSON> Hickey </PERSON>'s secretary, also indicated <PERSON> Stallings </PERSON> needed to work through the <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> hierarchy. `` The difficulty is not that he tried those channels and is blocked,'' <PERSON> Lori </PERSON> said. `` The difficulty is that he has spurned those channels.'' <PERSON> Lori </PERSON> said the church must reject the idea `` that only blacks can preach to blacks'' and whites to whites. However, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Cartwright </PERSON>, an expert in black religion at <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, said that's part of the problem. `` The church has been colorblind to a fault,'' he said. `` It's blind to itself ... You almost need to hold a mirror up to it.''

 The intense rain flooding the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> this week is part of an unyielding weather pattern aided by remnants of tropical storm <PERSON> Allison </PERSON>, meteorologists report. The weather pattern is unusual, the meteorologists said, but resembles patterns that flooded parts of <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> four years ago and drenched the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> in 1972 _ both in the wake of damaging storms. This week's rain disrupted train service between <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, swept away a camper in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> and created generally miserable conditions in the region. `` Something like this is somewhat unique because it's a slow moving pattern ... just kind of stagnating here,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Miskus </PERSON> of the federal Climate Analysis Center. Intense rain drenched a relatively narrow strip from suburban <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> to suburban <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> on Wednesday, meteorologists said Thursday. From 2 to 6 inches of rain fell in most areas but 10 inches or more fell in some spots, especially in northern <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION>. `` It's not a frequent occurrence, but it happens,'' said storm specialist <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Case </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hurricane </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Coral </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gables </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, pointing to a similar situation that caused <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>'s floods in 1985. Case said tropical storm <PERSON> Allison </PERSON> is n't directly to blame for the stagnant pattern, but it has helped keep the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> under its wet blanket. <PERSON> Allison </PERSON> came ashore in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> more than a week ago, worked northward to western <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> and drifted to <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>, where Case said it is identified as a low pressure area. The air circulates in a counter-clockwise direction around lows. At the same time and to the north, a high pressure center is circulating in the opposite direction over the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION>, leaving the high and the low systems grinding against each other like two gears, said Case. The air flows have pulled warm, moist air northward from the <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, said Case. `` The real culprit is this inundation of tropical, unstable air,'' he said. Case said Hurricane Juan in 1985 and tropical storm <PERSON> Agnes </PERSON> in 1972 left similar patterns as mementos after they had gone. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Richards </PERSON> and <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Kroczyksni </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hydrology </ORGANIZATION> explained that on Tuesday night and Wednesday cold air moved in above the warm tropical air between <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. The cold air, which was heavier and more dense, sank down, leading to a sudden overturning of the cold and warm air. `` Once it started it was almost like a chain reaction,'' said <PERSON> Richards </PERSON>, explaining the deluge. But <PERSON> Miskus </PERSON> said even some of the dramatic rainfall totals reported in <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> fail to compare to tropical storm records. The most rain from one storm in a single day occurred in <LOCATION> Alvin </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, in 1979 when 43 inches fell in 24 hours, he said. The latest rain is falling on a region already softened up by stagnant weather patterns that persisted in May, leading that month to be the wettest since 1895 in the southeast and the second wettest in the south, said <PERSON> Miskus </PERSON>.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> sugar production is rising after a slump because of last year's drought, according to <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> forecasters. Total production in the 1989-90 crop year that begins Sept. 1 is expected to be about 7.3 million tons, up 5.6 percent from 1988-89 output estimated at 6.91 million tons. Prompted by prices guaranteed under the government's system of supports and protective quotas that limit the entry of cheaper foreign sugar, domestic output climbed to a record 7.33 million tons in 1987-88. In 1985-86, by comparison, total <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> sugar production was barely 6 million tons. With improved growing conditions, sugar production in the coming year could match or exceed the record level of two years ago. Beet sugar production, forecast at 3.9 million tons, would be up 11 percent from the drought-reduced level of 3.51 million tons this season, the department's <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday. Cane sugar, which rose to a record of just under 3.4 million tons in 1988-89, is forecast at about the same in 1989-90. `` According to field information through mid-June, beet planting and early development have generally gone well throughout the beet areas,'' the report said. `` This is in sharp contrast to last year when a series of spring weather problems was followed by drought in key eastern growing areas.'' The report added: `` Drought, particularly in the non-irrigated <LOCATION> Red </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> of western <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> and eastern <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>, and disease and weather problems in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, lowered yields.'' These three states accounted for 55 percent of total sugar beet harvested acreage in 1988-89 and 51 percent of the total beet tonnage. That compared with 56 percent and 54 percent, respectively, during the three previous seasons. Yields would have been even lower had it not been for good growing conditions late in the season, excellent harvesting weather and higher rates of sugar recovered from the beets, the report said. Farmers are expected to have about 1.3 million acres of beets for harvest in 1989-90, about the same as this season. The area for sugar cane harvest is expected to be about 807,000 acres, up 10 percent from 1988-89, reflecting small increases in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. Mainland production is forecast at about 2.45 million tons, and <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>'s output, 940,000 tons. `` <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>'s sugar cane acreage continues to contract, with only 77,000 acres likely to be harvested this season, compared with almost 100,000 in the early 1980s,'' the report said. `` Alternative land use continues to encroach on traditional sugar acreage.''

 <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> has turned into a growing market for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> duck feet and tongues, says the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>.

As a result, the agency said in the July issue of AgExporter magazine, a number of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> poultry plants have built a thriving export business on supplying the <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> duck market. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoben </PERSON>, an executive with one processing plant, <ORGANIZATION> Concord </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farms </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Concord </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> duck processors sold more than 4 million pounds of duck feet to <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> alone last year. `` All of our duck feet and tongues are exported to <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Hoben </PERSON> said `` That market represents 4 percent of our total business, and it is a very important market for <ORGANIZATION> Concord </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farms </ORGANIZATION>.'' Aggressive market promotion in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> has been part of the reason for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> success in the duck market. The <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION>'s Targeted Export Assistance Program, which helps finance approved overseas promotional efforts, has been particularly effective. For example, the program financed a booklet featuring recipes for duck feet, tongue and duckling recipes for the <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> market, available there in both Chinese and English, the report said.

 Marines guarding the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> embassies abroad are often limited in off-duty activities, but now there's something for their minds _ college by mail The Marine Security Guard Battalion reached an agreement recently with <ORGANIZATION> Penn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> to offer an associate-degree program to the 1,450 Marines guarding 141 embassies and consulates around the world. Taking classes by mail will help relieve boredom in such hardship posts as the embassy in <LOCATION> Ouagadougou </LOCATION>, the capital of the west African nation of <PERSON> Burkina </PERSON> <PERSON> Faso </PERSON>, Marine Capt. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Vindich </PERSON> said. `` There's absolutely nothing there,'' said <PERSON> Vindich </PERSON>, the battalion's education officer. Also, Marines stationed at embassies and consulates in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> are restricted by a non-fraternization policy, while those in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> ca n't leave the compound because of the country's civil war. `` A lot of these places are really isolated,'' <PERSON> Vindich </PERSON> said. `` We're providing an educational opportunity and we're also giving them something to do.'' <PERSON> Vindich </PERSON> said Marines in the elite, all-volunteer battalion generally spend 15 months in a hardship post and then 15 months at a less rigorous embassy or consulate. More than 400 Marines serving in embassies and consulates already take courses, but their efforts toward degrees have been largely unstructured, he said. `` They were out there spinning their wheels. You talk college credits and semester hours and that kind of thing, it boggles the mind of a 19-year-old kid just out of high school, 10,000 miles from home,'' <PERSON> Vindich </PERSON> said in a telephone interview from <LOCATION> Quantico </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va </LOCATION>. Under an agreement reached in May, <ORGANIZATION> Penn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> will offer liberal arts degrees in letters, arts and sciences. The university has planned course concentrations for the Marines including business, security and justice, political analysis and foreign policy, and language and culture. <PERSON> Vindich </PERSON> said he expects 400 would sign up this year. An associate degree would cost about $ 4,800 or $ 5,000, said <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Forster </PERSON>, coordinator of special programs at <ORGANIZATION> Penn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Independent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Learning </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Vindich </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> pays 75 percent of tuition costs. <ORGANIZATION> Penn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> has the largest university-based correspondence course program in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, offering 225 courses to 22,000 students.

 Federal safety officials want the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> to be allowed to regulate luxury cruise ships that are owned by Americans, carry Americans and use American ports but fly under foreign flags. `` We're not in a position to protect the lives of an <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> citizen in these types of vessels, and something's got to be done about it,'' said <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Burnett </PERSON>, a member of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday issued several recommendations that would affect more than 80 cruise ships that dock at <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ports. Only two or three such cruise ships are registered in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, board investigators said. The board, which is preparing a more extensive report on the cruise ship industry in a few months, recently concluded an investigation into a fire that caused a near-catastrophe aboard a Bahamian-flagged vessel off the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> coast 16 months ago. The board concluded that a lack of maintenance, lack of fire-fighting procedures and poor crew training caused the fire aboard the Scandinavian Star, which was carrying 700 people back to <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Petersburg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, from a two-day Gulf of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> cruise. The board said failure of a fire-fighting system and the inability of crew members, who spoke a variety of languages, to communicate with each other and with passengers contributed to the emergency. `` It was only sheer luck'' that no injuries or deaths occurred aboard the 10,000-ton vessel owned by Sea Escape of <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, said <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kolstad </PERSON>. `` This is an invitation to disaster,'' said <PERSON> Kolstad </PERSON>. He said U.S.-owned cruise ships are registered in several different countries because of the high expenses involved in meeting requirements as <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> flag carriers. <PERSON> Jill </PERSON> <PERSON> DeChello </PERSON>, spokeswoman for <ORGANIZATION> Sea </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Escape </ORGANIZATION>, said the company had no immediate comment on the board decision. She said the company operates four 10,000-ton ships, each carrying 950 to 1,100 passengers on cruises out of <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>. In the last decade, the board has investigated five major fires aboard cruise vessels, three of them on Sea Escape ships. One in 1984 killed one passenger and one crew member. Scores of people have been injured, mostly from smoke inhalation. No other deaths have been reported in accidents aboard American-operated cruise ships, but a Cuban ship captain and two sailors were killed when the U.S.-owned Celebration cut their freighter in half Feb. 10. The board is seeking court orders to force witnesses to give testimony in its investigation of the Celebration accident. The ship's owner, <ORGANIZATION> Carnival </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cruise </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ship </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lines </ORGANIZATION>, has refused to cooperate in the safety investigation, saying it is responding only to authorities in <LOCATION> Liberia </LOCATION>, where the vessel is registered. In Thursday's action, the board asked the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION>, which regulates civilian shipping, to seek legislation that would give it authority over the safety of cruise ships. The board also called for smoke detectors that automatically shut down ventilation systems so smoke wo n't spread through passenger cabins; improved testing of fire extinguishing systems; back-up generators for fire alarms, public address systems and smoke detectors, and several other safety improvements for all cruise ships. The safety board has no authority to impose its recommendations. The board said the Scandinavian Star fire on March 15, 1988, started with an oil leak. It said fuel pipe packing seals and deflector sleeves that would have prevented the oil from being ignited were deteriorated and had not been replaced. `` I'm afraid this ship was being managed more like a night club than a vessel,'' said board member <PERSON> Burnett </PERSON>, who led the investigation into the fire. The ship, which was towed to <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> after the fire was put out, has since been repaired and is back in operation.

<HEAD>Auto Industry Unsure Whether Asbestos Ban Will Boost Prices</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DONNA CASSATA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Auto industry officials say the jury is out on whether a government ban on most remaining uses of cancer-causing asbestos will translate into higher prices for consumers. `` The substitute material and system are relatively more expensive. I ca n't quote you a figure,'' <PERSON> Toni </PERSON> <PERSON> Simonetti </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, said Thursday shortly after the government announcement. But many companies, including <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION>, have been substituting other materials for asbestos in products such as brake pads and linings for several years. Consumers, therefore, have already paid the price for the change. `` We have known that we should be eliminating asbestos from various parts of our products,'' said <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Bowditch </PERSON>, vice president for technical affairs at the <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Vehicle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The industry official also said he did not believe the switch to substitute material would be considerably more expensive. In the face of widespread criticism, the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> ordered a ban on asbestos used in a range of items from automobile brake parts to roof shingles. The prohibition is to be phased in over the next seven years. The ban will reduce the number of asbestos-related cancer deaths by at least 200, the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> said. The ban, however, does not affect existing asbestos-containing products. <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> officials expressed concerns that replacing the hazardous material might be more dangerous than a phase-out. The agency first listed asbestos, a natural product that has a strength 10 times of steel but can be woven like cotton, as a hazardous air pollutant in 1972 and urged it to be banned in 1979. `` The first question I had was why has this thing been around so long,'' said <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> administrator <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Reilly </PERSON> in announcing the ban. Critics have charged that the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration prevented earlier <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> action on asbestos. Nevertheless, use of the material has declined significantly. In 1987, 85,000 metric tons of asbestos was used for a wide array of products, down from the 240,000 metric tons used in 1984. Asbestos has been linked with various forms of cancer, including lung cancer. Auto makers have been phasing out asbestos for use in brake pads and linings, and many said Thursday that the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> decision came as no surprise. `` A company-wide program to remove asbestos from our disc brake pads, drum brake linings and other components began in the early 1980s. Since that time, considerable progress has been made,'' said <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sussman </PERSON>, an official at the <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> is aiming for a total phase-out of asbestos in its North American passenger cars by 1993 for 1994 models <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION>, meanwhile, produces front disc brakes that are almost all asbestos-free. However, 75 percent of the company's cars and half of its small trucks have rear drum brakes with asbestos pads and liners. Under the ban, the use of asbestos in some products, including roofing material, pipe wrap and sheet products will be prohibited next year. Use in brake pads and linings will be banned in 1993, and its use in auto replacement parts, cement water distribution pipes, roof shingles and a variety of other products will end in 1996. The agency estimates that the cost to consumers for the phase-out will be about $ 460 million over the next 13 years. Among the substitute products are kevlar, a synthetic fabric used with resin, and some types of metallic fiber, industry officials said. One manufacturer, who requested anonymity, said he prefers the substitute. `` Most of us would rather sell metallic pads, anyway. They cost more,'' he said. The ban does not cover guided missile liners, acetylene cylinders and some sealing tapes. The <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> said it was difficult to find adequate substitutes and the hazards involved were minimal.

 <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Fiske </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> says he withdrew from consideration for the No. 2 job at the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> to avoid a lengthy confirmation battle threatened by conservative Republican senators. The withdrawal marked a setback for Attorney General <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON>, who had lobbied conservatives on behalf of his choice for deputy attorney general. <PERSON> Fiske </PERSON>'s letter to <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> taking his name out of consideration was released Thursday by the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. Last month, 14 mostly conservative Republican senators, objecting to <PERSON> Fiske </PERSON>'s role as chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Standing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> from 1984 to 1987, urged President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> not to nominate him for the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> post In his letter, <PERSON> Fiske </PERSON> wrote: `` While I have no doubt that my nomination would have won the overwhelming support of the members of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, there could have been a long delay in final action. `` Knowing of your need to fill this important position as quickly as possible, I reluctantly concluded that it would be best for me to step aside at this time.'' <PERSON> Fiske </PERSON>, reached by telephone, declined to comment, saying only that he would continue his private legal practice in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. A pillar of the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> legal establishment, <PERSON> Fiske </PERSON> served as <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> during the Ford administration. But conservatives criticized him for his role in screening President <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s judicial nominees for the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. Sen. <PERSON> Strom </PERSON> <PERSON> Thurmond </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-S.C. </LOCATION>, the ranking <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> member on the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, had urged <PERSON> Fiske </PERSON> to withdraw to avoid a lengthy, divisive confirmation fight in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Thurmond </PERSON> warned <PERSON> Fiske </PERSON> that some opponents might wage filibusters to stall his confirmation. Opponents accused him of torpedoing <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s nominations by forwarding the names of prospective nominees to liberal organizations, giving the groups an advance opportunity to organize opposition. <PERSON> Fiske </PERSON> acknowledged that names were sent to these organizations as part of a longstanding ABA practice of determining if potential nominees had shown a history of bias against minorities and women. The conservatives also accused <PERSON> Fiske </PERSON> of using ideological criteria to rate the professional qualifications of <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s nominees In his reply to <PERSON> Fiske </PERSON>, <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> expressed `` great regret'' at the decision and said conservatives had `` misstated and misunderstood'' his record as chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> ABA </ORGANIZATION> screening panel. `` I am glad to have been part of the effort to set the record straight, which now has been done,'' <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> said.

But later this month, <PERSON> Jonathan </PERSON> <PERSON> VIII </PERSON>, the latest in a line of huskies that have represented the college, may win back his ancestors' status as symbol of school spirit. <ORGANIZATION> Alpha </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Phi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Omega </ORGANIZATION>, a coeducational service fraternity, has asked the board of trustees to restore <PERSON> Jonathan </PERSON>'s status. The board is expected to take up the issue July 14. The huskies were named after an early <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> governor, <PERSON> Jonathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Trumbull </PERSON>. Many of the dogs figure prominently in the lore, especially <PERSON> Jonathan </PERSON> IV which survived a dog-nabbing by <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> students. In 1969, the <ORGANIZATION> Student </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>'s decision to sell the mascot was protested by about 2,500 students. <PERSON> Alpha </PERSON> <PERSON> Phi </PERSON> <PERSON> Omega </PERSON> took responsibility for the dog; <PERSON> Jonathan </PERSON> <PERSON> VIII </PERSON> lives with a family off campus. Fraternity members say if the trustees name the newest <PERSON> Jonathan </PERSON> as school mascot, they will trot him out for events. They plan to show him off at sporting and social events, and will lobby for him as grand marshal of the Homecoming Day parade.

<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will cancel debt _ potentially billions of dollars _ owed the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> by sub-Saharan African countries. The announcement Thursday by President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> marks a reversal for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, which has preferred only to stretch out repayment terms for debtor nations. `` Beginning Oct. 1 the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government will forgive official development loans in the sub-Saharan countries,'' the president told a news conference. In 1987, the most recent year in which figures were immediately available, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> put the total of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> loans to sub-Saharan <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> at $ 4.3 billion, including $ 743 million in development loans, $ 1.5 billion from the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government's <ORGANIZATION> Export-Import </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> and $ 1.2 billion in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government loans to buy surplus American farm products <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> did not say which of these categories would be included. <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> south of the <LOCATION> Sahara </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Desert </LOCATION> is usually taken to mean all of <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> except <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and the North African countries on the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> _ <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tunisia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Morocco </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said his action would be in accordance with a decision made last year in <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION> at an economic summit of industrialized democracies to offer different options to creditor governments. Other governments, notably <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION> and the Nordic countries, have converted many loans into grants. Loans have become the preferred form of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid, but as Third World debt has mounted and the burden of interest payments on debtor countries increased, the pendulum has swung back to grants. In 1987, sub-Saharan <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> owed $ 137.8 billion in medium - and long-term debt It was estimated that payments due from these countries had risen from $ 5.6 billion in 1979 to $ 21 billion a year for the period 1986 to 1989. Total Third World debt is put at about $ 1.3 trillion.

 President <PERSON> Hussain </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Ershad </PERSON>, who took power in a bloodless coup in 1982, has proposed a constitutional amendment limiting the presidency to 10 years. The proposed amendment was presented to parliament Thursday, where it is assured of passage because <PERSON> Ershad </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Jatiya </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> holds 251 of the 300 seats. `` I am certain that they -LRB- the legislators -RRB- are going to pass it, so it is good from my side and I am certain it is good for our country,'' the 59-year-old former army general said. <PERSON> Ershad </PERSON> resigned from the army in 1985 and a year later was elected to a five-year presidential term in national balloting that political opponents and foreign observers said was tainted by widespread vote fraud. Under the proposed amendment, <PERSON> Ershad </PERSON> can seek re-election in 1991 to another 5-year term but he would be banned from seeking a third term. <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION> has had nine presidents since it won independence from <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> in 1971. Each took office through military intervention, either through coup and assassination or through installation of civilians who heeded the army's dictates. <PERSON> Ershad </PERSON>, who has governed <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION> longer than any other leader, said the decision to limit the term of the president was part of his effort to modernize the nation. `` We have to prove to the world that <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION> is something more than a poor country,'' <PERSON> Ershad </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION>, whose 110 million people have an average annual income of only $ 160, is perennially buffeted by floods, cyclones, tornadoes and drought.

<HEAD>Surgeon Says Brown Doing Fine After Bypass Surgery</HEAD>

 A surgeon said former Gov. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Y </PERSON>. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> was doing fine after an unexpectedly difficult 5 -LCB- - hour quadruple-bypass operation, his second open-heart operation in six years `` He's doing very well,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Allan </PERSON> <PERSON> Lansing </PERSON>, who performed the surgery Thursday. `` He's had no problems or complications so far.'' <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, 55, was listed in critical condition in the intensive care unit of <ORGANIZATION> Humana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital-Audubon </ORGANIZATION> late Thursday night. Hospital officials said it was routine for patients to be listed in critical condition after that kind of operation. Dr. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Dageforde </PERSON>, a cardiologist also caring for <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, said the former governor had suffered a minor heart attack late last Friday. <PERSON> Dageforde </PERSON> said subsequent tests showed damage to his heart was `` minimal.'' After initially checking into a <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lauderdale </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, hospital complaining of chest pains, <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> was flown to <LOCATION> Humana-Audubon </LOCATION>, where tests were conducted Wednesday. The evaluation detected some coronary blockage requiring treatment, and <PERSON> Lansing </PERSON> scheduled the surgery after consulting with <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> and family members. Despite what the doctors described as `` prolonged and difficult'' surgery, <PERSON> Lansing </PERSON> said <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> should be released from the hospital within a week to 10 days. <PERSON> Lansing </PERSON> said he expected no recurrence of complications that occurred after <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> underwent a triple-bypass operation in June 1983, when he was nearing the end of his four-year term as governor. Following his gubernatorial term, <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> ran for the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> in 1984 against <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> `` Dee'' <PERSON> Huddleston </PERSON>.

<DATELINE>CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Industrial nations should join banks in writing off up to 50 percent of the Third World debt, former Secretary of State <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Kissinger </PERSON> said. `` Realistically, banks alone can not bear the burden of what creditors have to do,'' he said Thursday. <PERSON> Kissinger </PERSON>, who came to this country on Wednesday for a three-day visit at the invitation of President <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Andres </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON>, denied reports he would be paid by <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION> to help it renegotiate the terms of its $ 33 billion foreign debt. <PERSON> Perez </PERSON>'s efforts to impose austerity measures in this country, backed by international creditors, prompted riots in February that killed about 300 people. Similar problems in May in <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>, which has the third-largest foreign debt in the developing world, caused food riots and led to the deaths of 14 people. <PERSON> Kissinger </PERSON> called for reducing Third World debt by up to 50 percent, `` depending on the performance of the debtor country.'' <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, led by <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>, owes foreign creditors $ 401 billion. <PERSON> Kissinger </PERSON> singled out <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION> as examples of debtor countries that have carried out economic reform policies on their own `` and are therefore deserving of our support.'' Asked about the crackdown in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> last month against the student-led reform movement, <PERSON> Kissinger </PERSON> said the harsh suppression occurred because `` economic reforms moved more rapidly than political reforms.'' However, he appealed for caution in Western policy toward <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. `` A billion Chinese are the single most important factor in <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>. ... The Western world should be very careful not to drive them back into isolation or hostility on an emotional basis,'' he said.

 Communist officials dealt a parting blow to longtime <LOCATION> Hungarian </LOCATION> leader <PERSON> Janos </PERSON> <PERSON> Kadar </PERSON> hours after his death by saying political changes had passed him by. <PERSON> Kadar </PERSON>, who died Thursday at age 77, came to power as Soviet troops crushed the 1956 anti-Stalinist uprising. He oversaw early stirrings of economic and political reform but lost power last year to enthusiasts of quicker change. In remembering his life, the party leadership, in a statement carried Thursday by state media, said <PERSON> Kadar </PERSON> had led the way to national consensus and always aimed at a `` humanist socialism.'' However, it said that `` time and the -LRB- communist -RRB- <ORGANIZATION> Hungarian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> have surpassed the life work of <PERSON> Kadar </PERSON>, the politician.

<TEXT>
 About a month after <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Braverman </PERSON>'s lover of 20 years died of AIDS, he found an eviction notice on the door of the rent-controlled <LOCATION> Greenwich </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Village </LOCATION> apartment they had shared for 15 years. On Thursday, after the state's highest court ruled that a partner in a long-term homosexual relationship can take over their apartment when the leaseholder dies, <PERSON> Braverman </PERSON> said: `` It means I won. A major burden is off my shoulders now.'' The case considered by the <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> involved another man in the same situation, and the ruling may affect thousands of homosexual men and women and their lovers _ their `` life partners'' or `` spousal equivalents,'' in the legal lingo that has developed. `` I think it's an historic event,'' said <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON>, a professor at <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> and chairman of the city bar association's committee on law and sex. `` It's the first time I'm aware of that the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> has recognized that a gay male couple may constitute a family, and obviously a lesbian couple as well `` That's pretty exciting, pretty revolutionary.'' Lawyers are uncertain, but the ruling may also affect unmarried heterosexual partners, older people who live together to save money, and poor families who ca n't afford legal fees to adopt children or obtain a divorce. The most immediate effect of the ruling was on <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>'s homosexual community, which is being ravaged by AIDS `` It's courageous, I think,'' said <PERSON> Everett </PERSON> <PERSON> Quinton </PERSON>, 37, who shared an apartment with playwright <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Ludlam </PERSON> for 12 years before <PERSON> Ludlam </PERSON>'s death in 1986. `` There was a bit of sympathy, of humanity. But then it was, ` Sorry to hear about it, but you've got ta get out now.' `` It's been happening all over. I'm glad this ruling came down. People can bury their dead and not immediately have to worry about where they'll stay.'' <PERSON> Quinton </PERSON>'s apartment, however, was rent-stabilized, not rent-controlled, and Monday's ruling, while encouraging, does n't extend to his situation Rent-control and rent-stabilization laws limit the rent increases landlords can charge for some apartments. The rent-control laws apply to longterm tenants in apartments built before 1947. The court expanded the definition of a family as it applies to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s rent-control laws, which say only `` family members'' may take over rent-controlled apartments when the tenant of record dies. The court said a long-term emotional and financial commitment makes a couple `` married'' in the law's eyes. Protection against eviction does n't rest on legal documents or blood relation, Judge <PERSON> Vito </PERSON> <PERSON> Titone </PERSON> wrote, `` but instead should find its foundation in the reality of family life.'' `` It is the totality of the relationship as evidenced by the dedication, caring and self-sacrifice of the parties which should, in the final analysis, control,'' <PERSON> Titone </PERSON> said. In a dissenting opinion, Judge <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Simons </PERSON> said the court was too broadly interpreting the state <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION>'s intent in drafting <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s rent control law. The court's 4-2 decision, he said, `` produces an unworkable test that is subject to abuse.'' For 54-year-old <PERSON> Braverman </PERSON>, who has AIDS, the ruling appears to remove the specter of eviction. More court hearings will decide that. `` I thought dealing with AIDS was enough of a battle for anyone, but this extra thing _ taking away my home, my support system, my roots in the community _ that was an awful thing hanging over my head,'' said <PERSON> Braverman </PERSON>. `` Now that this has come down, the lower courts will move, I hope, more aggressively to protect people in these circumstances,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Hansell </PERSON>, director of legal services for the Gay Men's Health Crisis Also on Thursday a law was scheduled to take effect in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> permitting unmarried couples to register as `` domestic partners,'' giving them certain rights such as the right to bereavement leave from a city job if the partner dies. But its implementation was suspended pending certification of signatures on a petition seeking to put the measure on the November ballot and repeal it.

 About 60 million Americans 20 and older _ more than one-third of the nation's adults _ face the risk of coronary disease because they have high blood cholesterol levels, a study has found. `` What's especially disconcerting is that high cholesterol levels are often seen in association with other risk factors _ hypertension, smoking, or being overweight,'' says <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Sempos </PERSON>, one of eight authors of the study published in today's Journal of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> `` And for many people, most of the desired changes could be achieved through a change in routines like diet and exercise,'' Sempos, a nutritionist and epidemiologist with the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Statistics </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Hyattsville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, said in a telephone interview Thursday. `` Even though we've made great strides in alerting the public to the dangers of cholesterol and heart disease, there's still too large a segment that is putting itself unnecessarily at risk.'' The federal center lists coronary disease as the nation's leading killer, claiming 521,000 lives in 1986, the last full year for which statistics are available. In the study, researchers examined data from 11,864 adults 20 to 74 years old who participated in the <ORGANIZATION> Second </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nutrition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Examination </ORGANIZATION> Survey from 1976 to 1980. The average blood cholesterol level for an American adult woman was 215 milligrams per deciliter. For men, it was 211. Cholesterol is a steroidlike compound that is produced both by the body and contained in fats that make up part of the diet. It is circulated in the blood and is important for normal functioning of the cells. But too much cholesterol can cause deposits to build up on the arterial walls, restricting the flow of blood to the heart muscle and contributing substantially to heart disease. Fruits, vegetables, whole grains and beans are known to lower cholesterol, and nutritionists say lean meat, fish and poultry in small portions are acceptable for a healthy diet. Foods cited as high in cholesterol include fatty meats such as spare ribs and highly marbled steak, ice cream and most other dairy products, egg yolks, pies, cakes and cookies. For the study's purposes, participants with a blood cholesterol level of 240 or higher were considered to be in need of medical advice and intervention to lower it. The same was true for any participant whose cholesterol level was 200 or higher if they had at least two other risk factors for coronary heart disease: high blood pressure, diabetes, previous heart disease or stroke, excess weight or smoking 10 cigarettes or more daily. Those two groups constituted 36 percent of the participants in the survey _ a percentage researchers used to arrive at the estimated 60 million American adults. Researchers found a substantial increase with age in the proportion of people who are candidates for medical advice and intervention: For those 20 to 39, the rate was 20 percent; for those 40 to 59, almost 50 percent; and for those 60 to 74, almost 60 percent. One doctor found some reason for optimism in the study's findings because the average cholesterol levels have been on the decline. `` We've gone from a cholesterol level of 240 for a middle-aged man during the 1950s to around 215 today,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Jeremiah </PERSON> <PERSON> Stamler </PERSON>, a professor of cardiology at <ORGANIZATION> Northwestern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>. `` We can do even better. `` The <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people have listened, and maybe now they'll listen a little more closely.'' The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Heart </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> estimates that the direct and indirect costs to the public related to coronary heart disease _ including physician and hospital fees, and loss of productivity because of worker absences _ will total $ 38.8 billion in 1989.

<HEAD>Forgotten Medieval Plaque Sells for Nearly $1 Million</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> dealer today paid nearly $ 1 million for a medieval enamel plaque that lay forgotten in a drawer for decades, <ORGANIZATION> Sotheby </ORGANIZATION>'s auction house said. In another transaction, <PERSON> Christie </PERSON>'s house said an 18th century mahogany chest of drawers sold Thursday for $ 1.8 million _ the highest price ever paid for a piece of English furniture. <PERSON> Sotheby </PERSON>'s said <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> dealer <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Lubin </PERSON> paid $ 926,000 for the plaque, which illustrates the biblical story of <PERSON> Cain </PERSON> and <PERSON> Abel </PERSON>. <PERSON> Lubin </PERSON> said he was buying the plaque for an institution, which he did not identify. The name of seller, who lives in <LOCATION> Carshalton </LOCATION> near <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, was not given. The seller told auctioneers that the 4-inch square plaque, made of copper and enameled in several colors, was left to her by her parents. She said she forgot about it for 30 years until she recently found it in a sideboard drawer. Art historians have identified 11 similar plaques in museums in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, but they dispute their origin. Some think they came from an altar made for <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Blois </LOCATION>, bishop of <LOCATION> Winchester </LOCATION> and brother of King <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> of <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>. He reigned from 1135 to 1154. However, at least one expert thinks the plaques came from a cross made for <ORGANIZATION> Abbot </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Suger </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Denis </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Lubin </PERSON> also paid $ 516,000 for three English enamel panels from a 12th century casket that depict biblical scenes. The seller was not identified. Neither the seller nor buyer of the mahogany chest were identified by <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Hanham </PERSON>, a spokesman for <PERSON> Christie </PERSON>'s. The <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> dressing and writing commode was built about 1760 for <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Beckford </PERSON>, a lord mayor of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, the spokesman said. The chest was one of a pair built by <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Channon </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Devonshire </ORGANIZATION> cabinetmaker. The other piece is on display in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Victoria </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Museum </PERSON>. <PERSON> Hanham </PERSON> said he believed the price was influenced by the auction sale of an American desk by <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> last month. At $ 12.1 million, the sale set the record for a piece of furniture.

 The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar firmed today against the Japanese yen after four-consecutive days of decline, while the key index on the <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> rose. The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose 280.49 points, or 0.83 percent, closing at 33,703.97. The index posted a 113.77-point gain the previous day. The dollar closed at 139.65 yen, up 0.75 yen from Thursday's close of 138.90 yen It opened at 139.33 yen and ranged between 139.00 yen and 139.83 yen. Today's turnaround in the dollar's direction came after a fall of 5.05 yen over the past four trading days. A dealer with <ORGANIZATION> Mitsubishi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> said the dollar firmed on buying for `` short-cover positions.'' `` Otherwise there was relative quiet'' as market players were waiting for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> unemployment figures for June to be released later today in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, said the dealer.

<HEAD>First Patient Treated With Remote Heart Attack Treatment Device</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A woman waiting for a heart transplant has become the first person treated through a telephone connection for a heart attack she suffered at home, hospital officials said. It was the first use of a device called the MDphone transtelephonic defibrillator, which was introduced last year at Jewish Hospital and two other medical centers since then. <PERSON> Ada </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>, 54, was one of two of patients equipped with the portable electronic cardiac treatment systems in mid-May, said Dr. <PERSON> Rodolphe </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruffy </PERSON> of Jewish Hospital. The device fits into a briefcase-sized case and can be plugged into a standard phone jack. On June 25, Mrs. <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> began experiencing an extremely rapid heartbeat. Her husband, <PERSON> Roscoe </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>, immediately activated the MDphone, which automatically dialed the hospital's cardiac care unit. After he attached two electrode pads to his wife's chest, hospital personnel activated the defibrillator, which restores the heart's normal rhythm through electric shock. <PERSON> Ruffy </PERSON> said the device saved her life. `` The system worked absolutely according to expectations,'' <PERSON> Ruffy </PERSON> said. `` The crew and the staff went through extensive training, so we were certain they were well-prepared.'' Both the <ORGANIZATION> Evanses </ORGANIZATION>, who appeared at a news conference Thursday, said they had been confident the system would work. `` With all the training, I knew my husband knew what to do. I had no doubts about it,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>, a retired bread salesman, said he did n't have time to worry. `` Something had to be done and I knew I had to do it, so I was n't scared,'' he said `` I had confidence in the machine and in the training and in what the doctors and nurses had told us it would do. I thank God for the machine.'' <PERSON> Ruffy </PERSON> said Mrs. <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> and other patients waiting for heart transplants were prime candidates for the device because it frees them from lengthy hospital stays. <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Wachtel </PERSON>, the president of <ORGANIZATION> MEDphone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Paramus </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, which developed the machine, said his company is negotiating for the use of the MDphone with about 25 other medical centers. Besides Jewish Hospital, the MDphone is being used at the <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Sacred </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Heart </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Pensacola </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>More Protests and Political Battles Over Flag Burning</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> lawmaker wearing flag stickers and soft-soled shoes ended a 12-hour filibuster against a flag-burning resolution early today as around the nation the issue sparked protests and political battles. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> introduced legislation that he said would outlaw flag burning without a constitutional amendment, while two people in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> were arrested in separate flag destructions and an <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION> judge was asked to block a flag burning. The unfurling of flag issues comes two weeks after the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> overturned a man's conviction in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, ruling that burning the flag as a protest was protected by the Constitution's freedom of speech guarantee In <LOCATION> Austin </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, state Sen. <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> Washington </PERSON> sought to block a resolution that asks members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to support a constitutional amendment making flag burning not a protected right of the First Amendment. He began his stalling tactics at 1:25 p.m. Thursday and ended it at 1:40 a.m. CDT today. `` I was prepared to go the rest of the night,'' <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> said. `` I do n't think I could have gone much longer than noon.'' It was unclear whether <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> leaders would bring up the resolution later today. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, who opposes flag burning, said the issue is protection of the First Amendment and nothing else. `` The Constitution has earned the right to be saluted,'' he said. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> also said the resolution had no purpose. `` It is utterly without substance, it is nothing more than a symbolic occasion for us to tell our constituencies and the world how we feel about this issue,'' he said. The effects of the hours of talking seemed to get to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. At one point, he rubbed his head and said, `` I'm starting to get a little stir crazy.'' Later, Rep. <PERSON> Senfronia </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> got on her knees and massaged his legs. Railroad Commissioner <PERSON> Kent </PERSON> <PERSON> Hance </PERSON>, a likely <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> candidate for <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> governor in 1990, said <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> was out of line. `` The people of this state do n't want the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> flag burned, and <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> Washington </PERSON> should be able to understand that,'' <PERSON> Hance </PERSON> said. The resolution passed the <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> last week, when members stood and recited the pledge of allegiance, and an early test vote in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> was 23-2 in support. Elsewhere, <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON>'s legislative proposal would make the simple act of burning a flag other than for legal disposal purposes illegal and punishable by up to one year in jail and a fine of up to $ 1,000. <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> said his bill would not violate the First Amendment's freedom of speech guarantees because it deletes `` any reference to conduct that has a communicative or expressive impact on others. The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrat </ORGANIZATION> said the proposal was preferable to President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s call for a constitutional amendment because protection for the flag could be provided much faster. The governor also said `` tampering'' with the First Amendment would establish a dangerous precedent. In <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, 19-year-old <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Rase </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Jacksonville </LOCATION> was charged with grand theft for allegedly stealing a 20-foot-by-38-foot flag outside a complex that houses the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Secret </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. Detective <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Bogers </PERSON> said <PERSON> Rase </PERSON> cut up the flag, attached the blue field with stars to his bedroom ceiling, and covered a sofa with the stripes. In <LOCATION> Gainsville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, art student <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Towery </PERSON>, 25, was released from jail Wednesday after his arrest for burning a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> flag along with paintings and other art objects in a Tuesday night theatrical performance he said was in honor of free speech. Police said they arrested <PERSON> Towery </PERSON> because he violated the city's burning ordinance He faces a misdemeanor charge of making a bonfire without a permit and within 150 feet of a building. In another case, <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION> Secretary of <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> McCuen </PERSON> asked <LOCATION> Pulaski </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Chancellor Judge <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Munson </PERSON> to block a flag burning scheduled for Sunday by <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> `` Say'' <PERSON> McIntosh </PERSON> at the state Capitol. <PERSON> McCuen </PERSON>'s petition contended that earlier attempts by <PERSON> McIntosh </PERSON> to burn a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> flag resulted in damage and endangered people. On Monday, <PERSON> Munson </PERSON> declined to block the burning.

 Rains lightened in the soaked <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> mid-Atlantic </LOCATION> states today while a heat wave continued to grip much of the West. Afternoon highs were generally above 90 degrees Thursday in the western two-thirds of the nation, and at least 11 cities in five states set or tied record highs for the date. Record-breaking hot spots included <LOCATION> Sacramento </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, where the high of 105 degrees exceeded by one degree a mark set in 1921; <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION>, where a high of 115 broke a 37-year-old record by one degree; and <ORGANIZATION> Corpus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christi </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, which broke a 1965 mark by two degrees with a high of 99. <LOCATION> Tucson </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ariz. </LOCATION>, set its seventh record high in the last eight days with a reading of 109, and Grand Junction, <LOCATION> Colo. </LOCATION>, set its third straight record high with 104. Temperatures were still close to 100 degrees in some parts of the <LOCATION> Desert </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Southwest </LOCATION> early today. Scattered showers and thunderstorms extended from the <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> to the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> early this morning, and a few showers and thunderstorms doused the Southeast. <LOCATION> Millville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, recorded just over an inch of rain in the six hours ended at 2 a.m. EDT, and <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Polk </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> La. </LOCATION>, received just over three quarters of an inch. That rainfall was nothing like the torrents that have caused floods and damage in the region in recent days. The bodies of two 15-year-old boys were found in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Brunswick </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, on Thursday, one day after they apparently were sucked into a sewer by rainwaters. More than 5 inches of rain were recorded in the area on Wednesday. Waters receded in <LOCATION> Cobb </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, northwest of <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, where as much as 8.85 inches of rain fell Wednesday night and Thursday morning. The storm demolished an unoccupied house, flooded several residences and flooded more than a dozen roads, and at least six roads were expected to remain closed through the weekend. Strong thunderstorms developed along a cold front during the night over southern <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> and northern <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION>, and one-inch hail fell at <LOCATION> Kadoka </LOCATION>, S.D.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and his squabbling <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc allies today opened a <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact summit that is expected to bring more arms control initiatives. The publicity-conscious Soviet president was tight-lipped about his expectations for the two-day meeting in the Romanian capital. Asked by reporters what he expected, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said only: `` I'll tell you after we finish. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> is attending the meeting with Soviet Premier <PERSON> Nikolai </PERSON> <PERSON> Ryzhkov </PERSON> and Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>. Romanian officials said reporters would be allowed no access to them and the other Soviet bloc leaders during the closed-door meetings. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> arrived in <LOCATION> Bucharest </LOCATION> late Thursday from <LOCATION> Strasbourg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, where he announced that <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> and its allies could agree on unilateral cuts in Soviet short-range nuclear missiles in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> if <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> is prepared to negotiate reductions on those weapons. This meeting may produce numbers for those cuts. The <ORGANIZATION> Western </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION> patched up a divisive row between <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> over such negotiations six weeks ago. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on May 29 proposed drastic reductions in conventional forces of both military blocs in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. Speaking Thursday at a news conference in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> spurned <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s call for swift negotiations on short-range nuclear missiles. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> noted that <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> leaders, at the summit in <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION> six weeks ago, agreed to begin negotiations on such weapons only after an East-West agreement had been reached to reduce conventional forces and reductions were actually under way. `` I do n't want to get off the track by re-opening the short-range nuclear forces package,'' he said. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> was pushing for quick talks on short-range nuclear weapons but agreed to delay them until after preliminary agreements are reached on conventional arms reductions at East-West talks in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION> signaled, however, it hopes agreement will come within the year deadline proposed by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. Other Western nations call that optimistic. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION> last month that the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact summit could deliver a detailed response to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s proposals to reduce the armed forces of East and West in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> to 275,000 on each side and agree on further cuts in weaponry and combat aircraft. Romanian officials said the Pact will not announce a decision until after the summit ends Saturday. <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>'s tightly controlled state media announced no firm agenda for the meeting. The state news agency Agerpres announced only that Eastern European delegations arrived to a welcome from President <PERSON> Nicolae </PERSON> <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc's most resolute foe of <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s moves toward more democracy and market-oriented economies. Just last week, in a speech pointedly distributed to foreign journalists covering the summit, <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON> rejected any return to private ownership and insisted, `` We must take a firm attitude against any attempts to denigrate socialism.'' `` We think that the concern with a better development of socialism in various countries should not bring a negation or underrating of the might of socialism,'' he added, in a clear swipe at recent developments in <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. Political reforms in those countries have divided the once monolithic <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc, with <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> most staunchly opposed to change and <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> also still dominated by orthodox communists. A Western diplomat, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said a meeting was expected to be held on ideology Saturday after the Pact summit formally ends. `` Very little is expected to come out of it,'' he said, alluding to the deep divisions within the Soviet bloc. Ideological quarrels have exacerbated traditional nationalism and centuries-old rivalries between the diverse ethnic groups of <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. Neighboring <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> are engaged in the fiercest feud, a war of words resulting from <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>'s alleged mistreatment of its 1.7 million-member ethnic Hungarian minority. <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> has also antagonized neighboring <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> with political reforms and a decision to halt work on a joint <LOCATION> Danube </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> dam project. <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION> is isolated from its Pact allies over its treatment of its Turkish minority, who are leaving the country by the tens of thousands following the death of at least eight Turks in violent protests against a Bulgarian assimilation campaign.

<HEAD>Former Governor Files Petition Challenging Impeachment</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Former Gov. <PERSON> Evan </PERSON> <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> is challenging his impeachment last yeer by the <ORGANIZATION> Arizona </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> in a petition with the state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. In the petition, which was filed Thursday, he asks for more than $ 570,000 in expenses and demands the impeachment be quashed or that he be given a new trial by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. `` We ca n't let it stand because _ not so much the effect on me but _ if that's the case, then no governor in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> is sitting safe,'' said <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>, who is campaigning for governor in 1990. Companion petitions filed by supporters claimed that they were deprived of a constitutional right to lobby lawmakers to keep <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> in office when Chief Justice <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, sitting as head of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Impeachment </ORGANIZATION>, said it would be illegal to try to influence the impeachment vote. <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>, a Republican, was ousted by the GOP-controlled <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> on April 4, 1988, on charges he obstructed justice and misused a state protocol fund. Speaking with reporters after Thursday's court filings, <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> and his lawyer, <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> MacPherson </PERSON>, said they would rather have <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> reinstated outright but would settle for a new trial and for proceedings on whether some senators were biased. <PERSON> MacPherson </PERSON> said the impeachment was flawed because senators never took a separate vote on each element of the potential offenses and because of confusion over the state of the law. The lawyer said the House bill of impeachment described <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> as doing some things in the course of his official duties when he actually had done them before his election. <PERSON> MacPherson </PERSON> also accused <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>'s impeachment trial lawyers, <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Craft </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jerris </PERSON> <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON>, of ineffective representation, saying they had not raised key issues such as the separate votes. <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>, who had praised Craft and <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> in the past, declined to comment on that portion of the petition. Craft and <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> said they understood why <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>'s new lawyer would raise the issue but recalled that <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> also had criticized all the other lawyers involved in the impeachment. Craft said <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> had called him for legal advice as recently as June 29. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> earlier this year rejected <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>'s call for a new trial, and legislative leaders said Thursday they would turn over the new challenge to their lawyers. <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>'s lawyers had to wait until now to file the petition because the <ORGANIZATION> Arizona </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Constitution </ORGANIZATION> does not allow lawmakers to be sued while they are in session. The <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION>'s 1989 regular session ended last month. <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>'s ouster elevated elected Secretary of State Rose Mofford, a Democrat, to the governorship. Mrs. <PERSON> Mofford </PERSON>'s press secretary, <PERSON> Vada </PERSON> <PERSON> Manager </PERSON>, declined to comment on the petitions. `` We're not going to speculate that far in the future,'' he said.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Japanese leaders are urged in a new report to stress to their people that both sides have more to gain through cooperation than ruthless rivalry. `` But unless the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> can come to terms with its fear of ` being taken' by the Japanese'' and the Japanese abandon `` their mercantilist view of the world, such cooperation remains beyond reach,'' says the report published by the <ORGANIZATION> Johns </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hopkins </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advanced </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studies </ORGANIZATION>. Leaders of `` both <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> need to foster greater public understanding of the real issues,'' especially on defense, said the 68-page study issued this week, entitled `` The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> in 1989.'' Three previous reports in the annual series dealt in detail with individual economic disputes between the two countries. The latest study focused more on managing the relationship to prevent conflicts from overshadowing basic advantages. `` Political leaders in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> should take the lead in working to eliminate misconceptions and reaffirm the basic premises of U.S.-Japan cooperation, lest misunderstanding lead to bad legislation,'' the report said. `` Although fundamentals supporting the U.S.-Japan relationship are almost universally positive, these can be quickly forgotten in bouts of name-calling,'' it cautioned. The report voiced concern over `` the rapid growth of a cottage industry of Japan-bashers in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> who warn us that <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> represents a greater threat than the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> to our economic and security interests. ... Their various allegations, if left unanswered, can erode the relationship ... leading to the self-fulfilling prophecy syndrome.'' Tracing what it called `` real issues,'' the study said, `` Japanese political leaders will have to make unprecedented efforts to present <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s defense responsibilities in a straightforward manner and stress the importance of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> -LRB- military -RRB- bases to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. `` <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government officials must ... educate the American public on Japanese contributions to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> defense ... -LRB- and -RRB- make clear that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> for its own national security, not simply to defend <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>.'' The study said both countries should correct domestic problems creating U.S.-Japanese friction.

<HEAD>Blood Plasma With AIDS Virus Slipped Through Detection Tests</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By IRIS CHANG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Scientists have found the AIDS virus in blood plasma supplies that had slipped through standard blood screening procedures, according to a study released today. The discovery means that plasma tainted with the human immunodeficiency virus, or HIV, could infect recipients of transfusions, said Dr. <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> <PERSON> Pierre </PERSON> <PERSON> Allain </PERSON>, an author of a study published today in the Journal of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Allain </PERSON>, of <ORGANIZATION> Abbott </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratories </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, and fellow researchers have developed an HIV-antigen test that they say can cut the detection time in half, which can help minimize the number of HIV-infected blood plasma from leaking into commercial supplies. The scientists studied 35,000 blood plasma samples collected over two years at two plasma collection centers and found seven to be HIV-infected. <PERSON> Allain </PERSON> called the number `` fairly high.'' But experts with the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> said that although the threat of a transfusion recipient being infected by HIV-contaminated blood plasma is real, the risk is small. `` Of the 2,236 transfusion-associated cases of AIDS reported by the <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> in April 1989, only two cases resulted from transfusions given since the implementation of HIV-1 antibody screening in early 1985,'' <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Y. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dodd </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Lewellys </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Barker </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> said in an accompanying editorial. Acquired immune deficiency syndrome is caused by a virus that damages the body's immune system, leaving victims susceptible to infections and cancer. It is spread most often through sexual contact, needles or syringes shared by drug abusers, infected blood or blood products and from pregnant women to their offspring. The current, licensed test can not detect the AIDS virus until the body's immune system has produced antibodies to fight the virus, usually at four weeks after infection, <PERSON> Allain </PERSON> said. The new test, developed by <ORGANIZATION> Abbott </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratories </ORGANIZATION>, searches for viral particles known as antigens, which appear about two weeks after infection. `` At this stage, the HIV is highly infectious, higher than at any other stage,'' <PERSON> Allain </PERSON> said. Beyond that point, the immune system produces antibodies that repress reproduction of the HIV virus, <PERSON> Allain </PERSON> said. The test currently is awaiting approval by the <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>. The researchers said they knew of no deaths caused by HIV-contaminated blood plasma that had slipped through the screening process.

<TEXT>
 The bulls once again thundered through <LOCATION> Pamplona </LOCATION>'s cobblestone streets today, and police said 30 of the 1,000 daredevils who ran ahead of the animals suffered minor injuries in the race made famous by <PERSON> Ernest </PERSON> <PERSON> Hemingway </PERSON>. This year's running of the bulls came a day after two bombs exploded in the city, wrecking two cars but injuring no one. During the run 29 people suffered bruises and scrapes after falling or being trampled by the bulls and the steers guiding them through a half-mile of narrow streets in <LOCATION> Pamplona </LOCATION>'s old quarter. Police said one young woman fainted and hurt herself when she fell to the ground. The weeklong festival is held annually from July 6-14 in honor of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fermin </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pamplona </LOCATION>'s patron saint. <PERSON> Hemingway </PERSON>'s 1926 novel, `` The Sun Also Rises,'' describes in detail the rowdy, round-the-clock festival that starts daily with the morning runs of the bulls. Each evening, matadors kill the six bulls that ran that morning. In the first running today, the bulls covered the half-mile from their pens to the bull ring in three minutes, 10 seconds. Thursday's bombs wrecked the cars of two politicians who belong to the <ORGANIZATION> Popular </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> party, police said. The group is widely believed to be the political arm of the Basque separatist group <ORGANIZATION> ETA </ORGANIZATION>. No group claimed responsibility for the attacks. <ORGANIZATION> ETA </ORGANIZATION>, whose initials stand for <ORGANIZATION> Basque </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Homeland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberty </ORGANIZATION>, has killed more than 600 people since it began a violent campaign for independence for the northern, three-province Basque region in 1968. <LOCATION> Pamplona </LOCATION> is the capital of the autonomous region of <LOCATION> Navarre </LOCATION>, which borders the Basque region. <ORGANIZATION> ETA </ORGANIZATION> also seeks the annexation of <LOCATION> Navarre </LOCATION>. During the festival, the city's population of 200,000 balloons to double its size because of the influx of tourists from around the world. The event, first held in 1394, has been held each year since 1591. Since then, bulls have gored 52 people to death, including 13 since 1924, according to city records.

 Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> today criticized <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> party for imposing new restrictions on the holding of <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> elections in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> action was `` not helpful,'' but he noted the step was taken by a political party and was not a government action. Speaking to reporters at the conclusion of a meeting of key Southeast Asian nations, <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will continue to support the Israeli government's proposals for Palestinian elections in the occupied territories. Among other restrictions, the Likud resolution said there can be no such elections so long as the 19-month Palestinian `` intefadah,'' or uprising, persists. The elections would be for Palestinians to choose leaders for the purpose of opening settlement talks with <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> authorities. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> spoke to reporters after attending a meeting of the six-nation Southeast Asian Nations and other interested parties. He is to fly later today to the Arabian peninsula nation of <LOCATION> Oman </LOCATION>. Additionally, <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said he and his <ORGANIZATION> ASEAN </ORGANIZATION> colleagues agreed on the importance of maintaining open lines with <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. While denouncing the `` horrible'' actions of the Chinese in cracking down on pro-democracy demonstrators a month ago, <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said there was agreement that outsiders `` must encourage <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s full return to the international community.'' The principal topic of discussion was how next to deal with the situation in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> once <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> completes its scheduled troop withdrawal by the end of September. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said that he had received assurances from Soviet officials of their willingness to establish an international peacekeeping force to guard against the outbreak of war in that country once the Vietnamese are gone. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said it would be his preference that the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>, who ruled with a heavy hand from 1975-1978, not be represented in any provisional government that may form after <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION>'s forces withdraw. He acknowledged too that he is in disagreeement with former <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> head of state, Price <PERSON> Norodom </PERSON> <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON>, on this issue. <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON> has said that it is better to have moderate elements of the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> in government than to have the rebel movement to continue its armed struggle in the field. In earlier remarks to his <ORGANIZATION> ASEAN </ORGANIZATION> colleagues, <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said there is a critical need for <ORGANIZATION> ASEAN </ORGANIZATION> and western unity to insure the emergence and survival of a new independent <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>. `` This new <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> must be free to determine its own future and it must not be dominated by the murderous <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>,'' he said. He called for a comprehensive solution encompassing a cease-fire, measures to control the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> effectively, transitional power-sharing arrangements and free elections.

 Officials of <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> said today they are worried about the fate of Sudanese leaders who were toppled in a military coup last week. The London-based human rights group said it was seeking assurances `` that all those detained are not being ill-treated and that they are being allowed prompt access to legal counsel, relatives and independent medical examiners.'' It also said in its statement that if the detainees were not being charged with a crime, they should be released without delay. The Sudanese army said late Thursday that soldiers surrounded the hideout of ousted Prime Minister <PERSON> Sadek </PERSON> <PERSON> el-Mahdi </PERSON> and captured him when he tried to escape. <PERSON> El-Mahdi </PERSON>, who led a civilian government, went into hiding after the coup.

 A police chief says his plea for people to turn in weapons and ammunition brought an immediate response, and he hopes other police agencies will follow his lead. `` If by getting these weapons off the streets we save even one life, it would be worth it,'' said <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Reque </PERSON>, chief of police for the Town of Grand Chute, a rural community of about 11,200 people. Reque announced late last month he would accept any and all guns and ammunition, legal or illegal, no questions asked, from anyone who brought them to the police station during business hours from July 1-15. The goal, he said, was to get dangerous weapons out of homes where they can pose a lethal risk to children. <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> has had several cases in recent weeks of shootings involving children in their homes.

 <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> USA </LOCATION> said it will make employees available for questioning in the state investigation of how some copies of company records on the <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Valdez </ORGANIZATION> oil spill were destroyed Company officials said Thursday that the destroyed records were backup computer files and that `` all primary records and documents'' on the spill remained on other computer tapes in company possession. `` I can assure you of <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION>'s continued cooperation in assisting your office to fully understand the circumstances and insignificance of the computer backup-tape matter,'' <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> lawyer E.D. <PERSON> Ackerman </PERSON> wrote <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> Attorney General <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Baily </PERSON>. <PERSON> Baily </PERSON> demanded Wednesday that <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> allow the state to take depositions from employees involved in the records destruction, which <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> says was an accident. He termed it `` potentially a loss of devastating proportions.'' <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramseur </PERSON>, a spokesman for Gov. <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Cowper </PERSON>, said <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> had agreed to supply affidavits next week from employees who handled the records. <PERSON> Baily </PERSON> said he hoped to get the depositions under way within two weeks. <PERSON> Les </PERSON> <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON>, an Exxon spokesman in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>, said the affidavits are part of an internal company report on the tape incident, which will be provided to the state. The oil company is under state and federal court orders to preserve its records of the March 24 tanker spill in which nearly 11 million gallons of <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> crude oil fouled Prince <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sound </PERSON>. While the state has not yet filed any spill-related lawsuits against <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION>, it plans to by the end of summer, <PERSON> Baily </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Baily </PERSON> said he became aware of the records destruction when he was contacted by a <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> reporter who had interviewed the main <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> employee involved, <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>. <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> told the newspaper that he had inadvertently destroyed the files and feared he was being made a scapegoat to cover his superiors' negligence in protecting company records. <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> was fired June 8, the day after the damage was discovered, the Times reported. The destroyed material included internal memos and word-processing documents from <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shipping </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, which owns the <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Valdez </ORGANIZATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION>, the newspaper said. <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Ackerman </PERSON> said the records were lost when the computer tapes were inadvertently `` written over'' with other information. The tapes normally are kept for a time to restore the computer system should its primary tapes be damaged. `` These backup tapes normally would be recycled every few weeks and are not intended to serve as a permanent archive of <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> documents,'' he said. In <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION>, meanwhile, the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> said it will provide the <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Valdez </ORGANIZATION> with a protective escort Tuesday when the damaged tanker arrives at the the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shipbuilding </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> shipyard for repairs. <ORGANIZATION> Seven </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Harbor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> boats will maintain a 300-to 500-yard safety zone around the tanker as it travels through the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> bay to keep boat-borne gawkers and protesters from impeding the vessel, <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> Cmdr. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Scarborough </PERSON> said Thursday.

 Actor and announcer <PERSON> Vic </PERSON> <PERSON> Perrin </PERSON>, who provided the spooky voice that told viewers of `` The Outer Limits'' TV show that their sets had just been taken over by mysterious forces, has died of cancer. He was 73. <PERSON> Perrin </PERSON>, who died Tuesday at <ORGANIZATION> Cedars-Sinai </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, was known to millions in the 1960s for saying at the beginning of each `` Outer Limits'' show: `` There is nothing wrong with your television set. ... Do not attempt to adjust the picture. ... We are controlling transmission.''

 The <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> passed a resolution saying it `` deeply regrets'' <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s continued expulsions of Palestinians from the occupied lands. With the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> abstaining, the 15-nation council on Thursday voted 14-0 for the resolution that cites the deportations last month of eight Palestinians. `` This proves once again the irrelevance of the whole institution,'' Ambassador <PERSON> Johanan </PERSON> <PERSON> Bein </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> said after the meeting. `` On the day of a major terrorist attack, in which 14 people are dead and 27 wounded, the <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> finds fit to deal with expulsions.'' He was referring to an attack in which a Palestinian shouting `` God is great!'' seized the steering wheel of an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> bus on the highway outside <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> and caused it to veer into a ravine where it exploded in flames. <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pickering </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> opposes expulsions but abstained from voting on the resolution because it did not take into account the violence and security problems facing <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> has expelled about 55 Palestinians since the Palestinian uprising against <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> rule of the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> began 19 months ago. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s staunch ally, frequently votes in favor of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. By not exercising its veto power as one of five permanent members of the <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> delivered a rare, but mild, chastizing of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. The resolution was adopted after days of negotiations in which the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> succeeded in changing its language from `` deplores'' to `` deeply regrets.'' `` In the absence of incitement and violence, expulsions would not be necessary,'' <PERSON> Bein </PERSON> said. `` Should quiet be restored, the possibility of allowing the return of the expelled persons will be considered.'' Since the uprising began, 550 Palestinians and 23 Israelis have been killed. <PERSON> Bein </PERSON> said the expelled were involved in activities ranging from throwing fire bombs and hand grenades to planting bombs, possessing arms, blocking roads and imposing a reign of terror on the local population. `` Expulsions, therefore, were the only means left to curtail these activities,'' he said. The resolution, sponsored by <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION>, demands that <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> ensure the immediate return to the territories of deported Palestinians and stop deportations. It cites the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> Convention of 1949, which covers treatment of civilians in time of war and prohibits expulsions. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> says the convention permits limited deportations under special conditions, and that its expulsions qualify. Current members of the council are <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Finland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nepal </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Senegal </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> and the five permanent members: the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was nearing a final decision on a proposal that would give most senior federal officials pay increases of 25 percent, matching a salary hike he has already advocated for federal judges, White House officials said today. But while the announcement was expected by day's end, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> still had not signed off on details of the proposals, said one official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. `` It's still on his desk,'' the official said. Both The <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> reported that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> would formally ask <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> today for the pay raise for top officials and would couple it with a proposed ban on congressional honoraria. Sources said the proposal now on <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s desk does not contain a specific pay raise proopsal for <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to go along with the proposed limit on outside income. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has advocated pay raises in general for <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, but has decided to steer clear of becoming ensnared in what is always a poltically treacherous issue on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>, deciding instead to let <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> resolve the matter itself, the sources said. An announcement on the pay issue seemed likely today as the president sought to clear away unfinished business before embarking Sunday on a nine-day trip to <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> that will include the seven-nation economic summit in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s pay package would include increases of as much as 200 percent for a small number of `` critically skilled'' federal workers. However, sources said the increase for most other senior federal officials would be an across-the-board 25 percent. White House spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> on Thursday night said the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> expects to announce the president's decisions today. <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Shaw </PERSON>, counsel to the <ORGANIZATION> Senior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Executives </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, said he had heard the president's proposal would be for 25 percent but had not received definitive word on that point. `` We strongly support the raise,'' <PERSON> Shaw </PERSON> said. The association, however, has opposed larger increases for key specialists such as physicians the government is having trouble recruiting and training. The 7,200 members of the government's Senior Executive Service and 800 top presidentially appointed executives currently make $ 68,700 to $ 80,700. Their pay is tied to the $ 89,500 that members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> get, and the rejection of the congressional pay increase in February meant no raise for them or for judges. A private commission headed by former <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Volker </PERSON> recommended a 25 percent increase immediately followed by a similar amount in 1991, applying to judges, executive branch officials, members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and others such as top military officers. The newspaper said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had decided not to change his previously announced proposals for <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to decide its own pay increase and for a ban on honoraria, the fees members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> get for making speeches.

<HEAD>Louisiana Wants To Test 1973 Court Ruling On Abortion</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> <LOCATION> House </LOCATION> has asked district attorneys to enforce a criminal law that was on the books before the landmark 1973 <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> decision giving women the right to have abortions. The resolution, which does not have the force of law, was approved 81-13 Thursday night. It now goes to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, which will give speedy passage, said Rep. <PERSON> Woody </PERSON> <PERSON> Jenkins </PERSON>. `` This will allow the court to face squarely the issue of whether to uphold or overturn the 1973 <PERSON> Roe </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Wade </PERSON> decision,'' said <PERSON> Jenkins </PERSON>, who serves as floor leader for issues pressed by fundamentalist churches. <PERSON> Jenkins </PERSON> said Monday's <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruling, in which it upheld <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>'s right to regulate abortion, invited states to test the <PERSON> Roe </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Wade </PERSON> ruling. <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>, like <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>, prohibits the use of public funds, employees or facilities for abortions. A check with the <ORGANIZATION> Louisiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> showed that <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>'s pre-Roe statutes were never ruled unconstitutional, said <PERSON> Jenkins </PERSON>. The chief law, said <PERSON> Jenkins </PERSON>, prohibits anyone from performing an abortion and carries a penalty of up to 10 years in prison. `` We were enjoined by the federal courts from enforcing it because of <PERSON> Roe </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Wade </PERSON>,'' he said. `` Our resolution will have the effect of sending the district attorneys to federal district court, asking that the injunction be lifted.'' Opponents said <PERSON> Jenkins </PERSON> wanted <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> to flout the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. `` We are saying with this resolution that we are going to go above the court,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Kip </PERSON> <PERSON> Holden </PERSON>. `` This is not just to provoke a ruling from the court. This is asking district attorneys to throw doctors in jail.'' Rep. <PERSON> Alphonse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said the Monday ruling did not disturb a woman's right to have an abortion in the first trimester. `` Women have that right,'' he said. The <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> legislature is in special session to ratify the extension of a state sales tax. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> noted that Gov. <PERSON> Buddy </PERSON> <PERSON> Roemer </PERSON> did not include abortion legislation in his official call for the six-day session. Legislators can not draft laws on topics not covered in the official call. However, <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Speaker <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Dimos </PERSON> said the resolution was not a law. `` This urges district attorneys to act. We can offer urge and request resolutions in this session.'' <PERSON> Jenkins </PERSON> said he believes the district attorneys will cooperate in a state that has such strong anti-abortion sentiment.

 Riot troops stormed two university campuses today to break up rallies supporting a South Korean student who defied a ban on travel to communist <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. Also today, 20,000 anti-communist protesters scuffled with police who blocked their path to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>. About 1,500 riot police moved on <ORGANIZATION> Konkuk </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in eastern <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> after student leaders issued a joint communique with North Korean counterparts. Riot police searched school buildings and took away about 200 students. The protest was held to support Im Su-kyong, a <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> student who went to <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> for the 13th World Festival of Youth and Students. The festival ends Saturday, and the government has said she will be arrested and charged with national security violations when she returns home. Student leaders said their communique, announced simultaneously in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, urged <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> students to work together for national unification and removal of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops from the <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> peninsula. At nearby <ORGANIZATION> Korea </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, 1,000 riot police firing tear gas charged the campus and battled several hundred students who rallied in support of Ms. Im. Protesters armed with firebombs, rocks and clubs drove police back after about 20 minutes of fierce fighting. About 20,000 riot police sealed off all major universities in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> and guarded downtown streets to prevent other rallies. Police stopped pedestrians and cars around campuses for identification checks and took away some students. The <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> government has accused <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> of using the festival to dramatize calls for the withdrawal of 43,000 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops based in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> under a mutual defense treaty. <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> and dissidents in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> contend the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces hinder unification of the peninsula, which was divided at the end of World War II. The anti-communist protesters initially pushed their way through police lines to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>, denouncing an opposition lawmaker who visited the North. The protesters demanded punishment of leftists and pro-North Korean dissidents. They also urged the <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democracy </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s largest opposition group, to purge what they called `` pro-communist elements.'' Shouting `` Down with the PPD!'' and `` Destroy communists!'' the protesters scuffled with riot police who blocked the march in front of the assembly hall. Many were elderly people who escaped <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> before and during the 1950-53 Korean War. <ORGANIZATION> PPD </ORGANIZATION> lawmaker <PERSON> Suh </PERSON> <PERSON> Kyung-won </PERSON> is under arrest after turning himself in June 25 for traveling to see North Korean leader <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Il </PERSON> <PERSON> Sung </PERSON> in August 1988. <PERSON> Suh </PERSON> was charged with violating national security laws, which carries a maximum penalty of death. South Korean authorities have arrested eight party members and friends of <PERSON> Suh </PERSON> who were questioned in the case. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> says all contacts with <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> must be made only through official channels.

 A pilot who spent 11 days in detention in <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> after being intercepted on an around-the-world flight, accused of spying for flying in a restricted area, says he'll stay at home from now on. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Haile </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, 58, a pilot for 20 years, has flown around the world in a single-engine plane three times. He returned to <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> on Thursday to receive a warm welcome from about 15 family members and friends. He promptly vowed to `` never leave the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. again.'' `` When you leave the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, you're very vulnerable,'' said <PERSON> Haile </PERSON>, owner and president of a Dallas-based engineering firm. `` If you break a rule, you have no rights. They just lock you up.'' Haile's Beechcraft Bonanza V-35B was intercepted June 16 by Indian <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> planes and forced to land after the planes believed he had strayed into restricted air space near the India-Pakistan border. He and seven associates were flying in four planes from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dehli </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, to <LOCATION> Bahrain </LOCATION>. Dr. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Wisner </PERSON>, another of the pilots, said that because of bad weather, the group had to adjust its course, which took the planes `` skirting down the edge of the restricted area'' about 350 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Bombay </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Wisner </PERSON>, 62, said he heard Haile's co-pilot, <PERSON> Carson </PERSON> <PERSON> Gilmer </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Rocksprings </LOCATION>, say, `` A MiG fighter just passed so close it almost took the paint off my plane.'' <PERSON> Wisner </PERSON> said he then heard the Indian pilot radio <PERSON> Gilmer </PERSON> and two West Germans in a second plane to land or `` you'll have the consequences.'' <PERSON> Wisner </PERSON>'s plane and another managed to escape while the MiG pilots concentrated on the two other aircraft. <PERSON> Haile </PERSON> said the planes were forced down at an Indian air force base, where the base commander accused them of spying. `` We were kept in what was like a hotel room'' in the desert town of <LOCATION> Bhuj </LOCATION>, which <PERSON> Haile </PERSON> said was a poor but nice hamlet that improved after sundown when the `` flies would all go away.'' He said after countless interrogations, authorities were finally convinced they were not spies and allowed them to leave June 27. `` When this is all over, I just want to be normal,'' said <PERSON> Haile </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> `` I just want to relax.''

 <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> intensified its assault on <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> today, saying the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has repeatedly violated the human rights of its own people and therefore has no right to criticize <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s handling of demonstrators `` During the process of quelling the recent counterrevolutionary rebellion the American government and <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> under the pretext of ` protecting human rights' meddled with <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s domestic affairs,'' said the People's Daily, the official publication of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. `` When the Chinese government on June 4 used firm methods to quell the counterrevolutionary rebellion, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government became furious and was the first to impose ` sanctions' on <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> to exert pressure on us,'' the newspaper said in a commentary. `` But everybody can still remember -LRB- <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> -RRB- <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON>'s notorious anti-communist, anti-China legislation,'' the paper said `` And 100 years after the declaration of the emancipation of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s slaves, the discrimination faced by blacks and people of other colors is still serious.'' <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> suspended military sales and high-level governmental exchanges after the Chinese army's bloody suppression of protesters seeking democratic reforms. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> says 200 to 300 people died; <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> sources and Chinese witnesses say up to 3,000 people were killed.

In a separate piece titled `` How America Tramples On Human Rights,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> mouthpiece printed a chronology of civil rights and antiwar protests in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, complete with numbers of arrests and deaths of demonstrators. In another story, the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> said student leaders passed on state secrets to foreign journalists and received foreign passports so they could escape from <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. `` The autonomous student union, through the help of foreign powers, even obtained passports for some 40 of their members, so they could flee the country in the event things turned for the worse,'' newspaper said. It did not name any countries that provided passports but said considerable financial support came from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and said people from <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> operated from rooms at the <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> Hotel near the square to distribute money to students. `` The student leaders maintained illicit relations with traitorous organizations overseas, and themselves were traitors and collaborators,'' it said. The People's Daily also repeated charges that students received money from overseas, saying: `` When the student leader ` masterminds' finally went underground, each had tens of thousands of yuan -LRB- thousands of dollars -RRB-. Major Chinese papers also gave prominent play to a lengthy speech by <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>'s conservative mayor, <PERSON> Chen </PERSON> <PERSON> Xitong </PERSON>, attacking a wide range of intellectuals for contributing to the political environment that fostered the democracy movement. <PERSON> Chen </PERSON>'s speech, to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> a week ago but only released Thursday, took up three full newspaper pages and lashed out at a number of writers, editors and dissidents whose airing of political positions `` prepared for the turmoil that ensued.'' The spreading purge of intellectuals included news reports of the ousting of a deputy editor-in-chief of the Huayue publishing house in rural <LOCATION> Shaanxi </LOCATION> province and the burning of a book the firm published, `` The Story of a Chinese Who Never Lies,'' because it allegedly embraces bourgeois liberalism, or Western liberal ideas. He also leveled further charges at former <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> <PERSON> Ziyang </PERSON>, who was sacked last month for his pro-student views. He was replaced by <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION> party chief and political hard-liner <PERSON> Jiang </PERSON> <PERSON> Zemin </PERSON>.

<TEXT>
 A battle by musicians to block taped music in resort showrooms got a boost when several stars led by <PERSON> Sammy </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> rallied for live entertainment. `` We ca n't have this town, which was built on live entertainment, live music, go the other way,'' said <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>. `` Do n't let them do this thing to us.'' The entertainers show of support came Thursday for members of the <ORGANIZATION> Musicians </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Local </ORGANIZATION> 369 who are locked in a dispute with five major resorts. <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Goulet </PERSON>, <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Orlando </PERSON> and <PERSON> Shecky </PERSON> <PERSON> Greene </PERSON> turned out at a press conference called by the musicians to publicize a fight musicians say will cost them dozens of their jobs. `` I do n't want to see my friends _ the musicians _ go the way of dinosaurs,'' <PERSON> Goulet </PERSON> said. `` For all of our sakes, let's bend a little and come to a mutual understanding.'' Some of the entertainers, however, professed little knowledge of the details of the dispute, and some contradicted the union's staunch position against eliminating jobs in production shows _ shows that feature an ensemble rather than a visiting headliner `` I think that might be a concession the musicians can make,'' <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> said, referring to the idea of using taped music at the production shows. `` But do n't bring it into the celebrity rooms, where the Sinatras and the others perform.'' The union is fighting a July 26 deadline three resorts have set to eliminate musicians in production shows. The resorts, and two others, have also proposed hiring musicians playing for showroom singers only for the time they actually work instead of guaranteeing them a certain number of paid weeks a year. `` How do you throw 45 lives away?'' Union President <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Tully </PERSON> <PERSON> Massagli </PERSON> said of those employed full-time in production shows. `` We've learned to live with some taping in town, but for an entire production show to be put to a recording is not fair to the musicians or the public.'' Musicians went on strike last month against the Tropicana Hotel when talks stalled on the resort's plan to use tape in its `` Folies Bergere'' show and have warned of strikes against the <ORGANIZATION> Flamingo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hilton </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Caesars </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Palace </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Bally </ORGANIZATION>'s and the <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hilton </LOCATION>.

 A Palestinian who grabbed the steering wheel of a bus and forced the vehicle into a ravine, killing 14 people, rode the route several times to choose the moment for the attack, newspapers said today. The bearded attacker, identified only as a Palestinian refugee camp resident, told investigators he was avenging beatings of family members by soldiers, Israeli newspapers said. National Police Commissioner <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Krauss </PERSON> announced a second injured suspect was detained in connection with the bus crash Thursday, the bloodiest assault since the Palestinian uprising began 19 months ago. <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> radio identified him as the attacker's father, but a police source denied that. Anger in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> brought calls for imposing the death penalty on terrorists. Arab newspapers hailed the attack. At the funeral of one Israeli victim in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, security forces rescued Finance Minister <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON> <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> from hundreds of people shouting and pounding on his car. <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> heads the center-left <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, which calls for giving up occupied land for peace. Police on horseback dispersed supporters of the anti-Arab Kach movement at a <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> rally after 200 attacked officers arresting six unruly protesters. `` Kill those who come to kill you!'' American-born Kach leader Rabbi <PERSON> Meir </PERSON> <PERSON> Kahane </PERSON> told 1,000 supporters who screamed back, `` Death to Arabs!'' At another victim's funeral, Cabinet Minister <PERSON> Avner </PERSON> <PERSON> Shaki </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Religious </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> demanded harsh measures. `` We must make supreme efforts at the next Cabinet meeting to ... look for new, stubborn, non-routine and harsh ways so this filthy <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> terrorism will end,'' said <PERSON> Shaki </PERSON>, who has no portfolio. Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> said the attack was `` the fruit of a disgusting mind, wracked with hatred.'' <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>'s daily <ORGANIZATION> Haaretz </ORGANIZATION> said the attacker `` planned in detail,'' riding buses several times along route No. 405 from <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, studying the road and drivers' behavior. The daily <ORGANIZATION> Hadashot </ORGANIZATION> said the suspect `` caused the bus to swerve at a point in the road where the security barrier is the lowest and the drop is dozens of meters.'' Pro-government newspapers in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> praise the attack. <LOCATION> Bahrain </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Akhbar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> al-Khaleej </ORGANIZATION> said it was a `` unique and bold operation ... affirming that the Palestinian people will not be broken.'' <LOCATION> Qatar </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> al-Raya </ORGANIZATION> said, `` The bold guerrilla operation by a young Palestinian man affirmed to the Zionist enemy that ... the Israelis can not continue with their repressive practices and brutal oppression without a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> response.'' A senior <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> official in <LOCATION> Tunisia </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bassam </PERSON> <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharif </PERSON>, said the attack was `` a human reaction by someone who has had his children killed, seen families deported, houses demolished.'' The crash Thursday was the worst attack in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> since a <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> assault on a bus on March 11, 1978, that killed 33 people and wounded 82. The crowded state-owned bus plunged Thursday into a 200-foot ravine and exploded in flames after the attacker, shouting `` God is Great!'' grabbed the steering wheel. The phrase is a rallying cry for the uprising. The attacker was slightly hurt in the crash and arrested at the scene, seven miles west of <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>. Police said two of the dead were Canadians, the first foreigners killed since the uprising began. They were identified as <PERSON> Shelley </PERSON> <PERSON> Halpenny </PERSON>, a dentist in her mid-30s from <LOCATION> Vancouver </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Fern </PERSON> <PERSON> Rykiss </PERSON>, 17, of <LOCATION> Winnipeg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Manitoba </LOCATION>. Ten other fatalities were identified as Israelis. The nationalities of the remaining two were not known Thursday, but the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> said they were not believed to be American. Twenty-seven passengers were injured and 25 remained hospitalized today, five in serious condition, officials said. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> diplomats said eight Amnerican passport holders were among them but refused to identify the victims. Hospital officials identified four as <PERSON> Rita </PERSON> <PERSON> Levine </PERSON>, 39, in serious condition; <PERSON> Eliezra </PERSON> <PERSON> Ben-Yehuda </PERSON> <PERSON> Cassuto </PERSON>, 53, in moderate condition; and <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Fingersh </PERSON>, 25, and <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Assal </PERSON>, 24, with minor injuries. Hometowns were not available. Mrs. <PERSON> Cassuto </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> is the granddaughter of <PERSON> Eliezer </PERSON> <PERSON> Ben-Yahuda </PERSON>, a famous Jewish scholar who helped revive Hebrew as a spoken language. <PERSON> Reuven </PERSON> <PERSON> Hazak </PERSON>, former head of the Shin Bet security service, told <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> army radio the attack probably is linked to the Palestinian uprising against Israeli rule in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> reports said the assailant is believed to belong to either <ORGANIZATION> Hamas </ORGANIZATION> or Islamic Jihad, which are fundamentalist Moslem groups. Security officials told <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION> they suspect `` nationalistic-religious motives.'' Thursday's victims bring the toll in the uprising to 33 Israelis and two Canadians killed. At least 546 Palsetinian have been killed.

 The last of five cloistered Roman Catholic nuns has left her monastery after spending nine months barricaded in the infirmary to protest liberal changes. Sister <PERSON> Teresita </PERSON>, who with four others locked herself in the room on Oct. 4, left the Carmelite monastery Thursday, leaving no word on her destination, said <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> Manning </PERSON>, a spokesman for the diocese of <LOCATION> Paterson </LOCATION>. `` She indicated to another sister that she was going to a safe place and would be in touch with <PERSON> Mother </PERSON> <PERSON> Theresa </PERSON> <PERSON> Hewitt </PERSON>,'' the monastery's prioress, <PERSON> Manning </PERSON> said. Last Friday, three other nuns ended their self-imposed exile, leaving only Sister <PERSON> Teresita </PERSON> in the infirmary. The three left with an <LOCATION> Akron </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, priest, according to laywoman <PERSON> Betty </PERSON> <PERSON> Sutton </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the rebellious nuns. Neither Ms. <PERSON> Sutton </PERSON> nor <PERSON> Manning </PERSON> knew if Sister <PERSON> Teresita </PERSON> was to join the other three nuns or how to reach them, they said. The five nuns began their protest quietly last October at the monastery about 25 miles from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> but soon found themselves in a bitter struggle with Paterson Bishop <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodimer </PERSON> and their prioress. Reached by The Associated Press in March, Sister <PERSON> John </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION>, one of the five, said the group objected to reforms instituted by the newly appointed prioress. They included such things as candy, television and popular music that she said detracted from the prayerful atmosphere intended by the founders of the Carmelite order. The five held out through threatened evictions by <PERSON> Rodimer </PERSON>, hoping their appeal to the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> would overrule the bishop's order to leave the monastery. But in February, the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> affirmed <PERSON> Rodimer </PERSON>'s authority and the bishop ordered the nuns to leave The first of the five protesting nuns left the monastery in March, because of health problems.

<HEAD>FDA Banning Sale of Non-Prescription Creams Sold to Grow Hair</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> said today it is banning the sale of non-prescription creams and lotions whose manufacturers claim they grow hair or prevent baldness, because none has proven effective. The <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> said in today's Federal Register that no manufacturer has been able to show that such a product works. The ban applies to products available without a prescription that are used externally. These products are usually sold by mail or through barbers or beauticians. The ban will become effective in six months, the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> said. The <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> also said there is no evidence that vitamins, food supplements or other products taken orally retard baldness or grow hair. The agency said it will remove these products from the market on a case-by-case basis if their distributors continue to make such claims. The only product approved by the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> for stimulating hair growth on the crown of the head is a prescription drug that is a 2 percent solution of minoxidil, which is applied externally. The drug is manufactured by <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Upjohn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and sold under the name Rogaine. The <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION>'s ban is based on a recommendation of an advisory panel that evaluated a number of ingredients, including lanolin, olive oil, wheat germ oil and vitamins. The panel found none of these prevented baldness or promoted hair growth. The <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> said that once the ban is in effect, manufacturers of any non-prescription drug claiming to prevent baldness or grow hair will have to provide proof to the agency that it is safe and effective before it can be put on the market.

<DATELINE>FRIARS POINT, Miss. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 White residents are complaining about their lack of representation on the board of aldermen, so town leaders have asked their lawyer to study creation of a white-majority district. `` I'm in favor of this,'' Mayor <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Washington </PERSON>, who is black, said after hearing a petition read from white residents. They comprise about 15 percent of the 1,400 residents of the <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> town. The petition asked aldermen to create four wards, including one with a 65 percent white voting-age population, and a fifth at-large slot on the council. Over the past 10 years, federal lawsuits have forced more than 30 <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> cities to change the way they elect city government officials to allow for greater black representation. However, Friars Point is the first municipality to consider greater white representation. `` We do n't deserve to have three places, or even two on the board,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Yount </PERSON>, who presented the petition Wednesday. `` We just want to be involved in what's going on and have a voice to represent our interests.'' Friars Point had at least one white member on the board until new municipal officials took office Monday and the council became all black. Currently, all members of Friars Point's board of aldermen are elected at-large, meaning all voters cast ballots for each member. The petition claimed that at-large system discriminated against white residents and violated the one-person, one-vote principle. Board members voted unanimously to have the town attorney study the feasibility of drawing up districts and report the findings at an aldermen meeting July 13. `` The majority of the board were in favor of going to the ward system. An expert should be employed to study population demographics and ward lines,'' said the attorney, Hunter Twiford. If the council does vote to change, it would require federal court and <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> approval under the Voting Rights Act of 1965. <PERSON> Yount </PERSON> said he was pleased with the petition's reception. He said the aldermen's cooperation would save the taxpayers money. `` We do n't want a lawsuit,'' he said. `` If we went to court and won, the town would have to pay attorney's fees. We do n't want that. We just want someone to represent us.''

 Hotel maven <PERSON> Leona </PERSON> <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON> personally approved the reimbursement of cash from business accounts to pay for some expenses at the <ORGANIZATION> Helmsleys </ORGANIZATION>' country estate in <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>, a former employee testified. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Piacitelli </PERSON>, the first witness at Mrs. <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON>'s federal tax evasion trial, also said Thursday that the cost of renovations and other expenses, even groceries, were spread over several <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON> companies. <PERSON> Piacitelli </PERSON>, fired as controller of the Helmsley-controlled <ORGANIZATION> Hospitality </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, said Mrs. <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON> would obtain cash for the estate by having employees fill out business expense sheets. `` Who approved petty cash reimbursements?'' asked Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> DeVita </PERSON>. `` Mrs. <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Piacitelli </PERSON> responded. `` Personally?'' <PERSON> DeVita </PERSON> asked. `` Personally,'' he said. Mrs. <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON>, 69, is on trial in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> federal court charged with evading taxes by disguising $ 4 million in renovations and operating costs at her <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> mansion as business expenses. She also faces other fraud and extortion charges. <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON>, 80, who was indicted in April 1988 with his wife, was removed from the trial after <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> found him mentally incompetent. The <ORGANIZATION> Helmsleys </ORGANIZATION> head a $ 5 billion real estate and hotel empire. They purchased <PERSON> Dunnellen </PERSON> <PERSON> Hall </PERSON>, in <LOCATION> Greenwich </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, in the summer of 1983 for $ 11 million. The Harley Hotel chain paid for tens of thousands of dollars of landscaping work at the estate because the company had a hotel in <LOCATION> Enfield </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Piacitelli </PERSON> said. In other testimony, <PERSON> Piacitelli </PERSON> said his company used the initials `` D.H.'' in business records to indicate money paid out to <PERSON> Dunnellen </PERSON> <PERSON> Hall </PERSON>. He said when he was asked in 1983 by an outside accountant to explain what `` D.H.'' stood for, he responded, `` Do n't hask.'' Soon after, <PERSON> Piacitelli </PERSON> said <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Turco </PERSON>, his boss and a co-defendant at the trial, wrote a memo saying the money had `` inadvertently'' been paid out as a business expense and that the company should be reimbursed. `` Were any of these payments inadvertent?'' asked <PERSON> DeVita </PERSON>. `` No,'' <PERSON> Piacitelli </PERSON> said. `` They were done deliberately,'' <PERSON> DeVita </PERSON> said. `` Yes, they were,'' the witness said. <PERSON> Piacitelli </PERSON> said he was fired from his job as controller in February 1986 despite a personal plea to Mrs. <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON>. The defense said in its opening arguments that it will show that the expenses were lawful because the estate was used for business purposes.

 Several bottles of cheap wine tainted with a soapy solution or broken glass have been found recently in areas frequented by transients, but no one has been injured, police said. The tamperings might have been attempts to harm the homeless, but if so, they were clumsy ones, police said. Officers noted that the bottle seals had obviously been broken and the caps simply screwed back on. The bottles were full. `` No one, under any circumstances, would want to have anything to do with bottles like that,'' Sgt. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Glaus </PERSON> said. `` We made an assumption, and we think it's a big assumption, that there might be an intent to do harm.''

The three bottles of <ORGANIZATION> Boones </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farm </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Strawberry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hill </ORGANIZATION> contained a soapy liquid, <PERSON> Glaus </PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>'s supreme commander in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, Gen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Galvin </PERSON>, said today the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact's superiority in conventional weapons is much more of a threat than its superiority in short-range nuclear arms. <PERSON> Galvin </PERSON> also said that jumping into negotiations on reducing short-range nuclear forces could make it tougher to bring the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact to the bargaining table to discuss conventional weapons. `` If we get into the shorter-range nuclear forces too early, we're giving away the major motivating idea, because the Soviets do want to see us get rid of nuclear weapons,'' said <PERSON> Galvin </PERSON>. `` They are not so anxious to get rid of conventional weapons.'' He was commenting on Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s statement Thursday that the <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pact </ORGANIZATION> could agree on unilateral cuts in Soviet short-range nuclear missiles in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> if <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> would negotiate reductions on those weapons <PERSON> Galvin </PERSON> said the Soviets have 1,400 short-range missiles launchers compared with <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>'s 88. <PERSON> Galvin </PERSON> also said that despite the appeal of glasnost, or openness, he questioned whether <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> was safer because of the risk of Soviet instability. `` I applaud the way the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> is moving,'' said <PERSON> Galvin </PERSON>. `` But it's a rocky road they're heading down. They're saying they ca n't turn back, but they do n't know precisely where they're going.'' He also discussed the crash Tuesday of a Soviet MiG-23, which zoomed across <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, apparently missed by Soviet radar, after its pilot ejected over <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. The plane eventually crashed in <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>, killing a man in his house. <PERSON> Galvin </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> troops' ability to spot the jet on radar and follow it proved the Allied system works. `` <PERSON> Mathias </PERSON> <PERSON> Rust </PERSON> is one thing _ a little tiny plane flying at low altitudes.'' said <PERSON> Galvin </PERSON>. `` But this plane took off from their own airfield and was flying at high altitude.'' He was referring to West German teen-ager <PERSON> Mathias </PERSON> <PERSON> Rust </PERSON>'s ability to evade Soviet air defenses two years ago and fly a small plane into Red Square. Two <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> F-15 fighters scrambled from a <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> base in the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION> `` as a policing action'' as the Mig-23 crossed into <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> on Tuesday, said <PERSON> Galvin </PERSON>. They shadowed it, hoping it would crash into the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Galvin </PERSON> said he accepted <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s explanation that the incident was an accident. The pilot ejected after reporting the plane was smoking. The Soviets say their radar missed the MiG-23 as it flew on for 500 miles. <PERSON> Galvin </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> pilots did not shoot down the Mig-23 or move alongside and tip it over because it was flying over populated areas.

 Thousands of people today defied martial law and rallied in memory of citizens killed during military crackdowns, waving flags and shouting slogans, witnesses and diplomats said. Western diplomats said groups of up to several hundred students gathered in the center of <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION>. Official <ORGANIZATION> Rangoon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> said six students were arrested. Up to 1,000 students gathered outside the gates of <ORGANIZATION> Rangoon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in an attempt to lay a wreath, but armed troops forced them to leave, said one diplomat who asked not to be identified by name. Diplomats reported that soldiers blocked off some streets in an effort to control the sporadic protests. Leading opposition figure <PERSON> Aung </PERSON> <PERSON> San </PERSON> <PERSON> Suu </PERSON> <PERSON> Kyi </PERSON>, speaking to a crowd of several thousand in <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION>, repeated her denunciations of the ruling military for its refusal to hold talks with opposition groups, a witness said. She spoke during a ceremony to remember a massacre of students after the 1962 military coup and those killed during army crackdowns on pro-democracy protests last year. Dozens of students were killed when the military put down a demonstration at <ORGANIZATION> Rangoon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> 26 years ago and blew up the student union building. Several thousand were killed last year when troops crushed months of pro-democracy demonstrations. <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>'s former leader, Ne Win, is held responsible for ordering both the 1962 and 1988 massacres. He officially relinquished control in July 1988, but <PERSON> Suu </PERSON> <PERSON> Kyi </PERSON> has repeatedly charged that he is the power behind the nominal head of state, <PERSON> Saw </PERSON> <PERSON> Maung </PERSON>. <PERSON> Suu </PERSON> <PERSON> Kyi </PERSON>, general secretary of the largest oppostion group, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democracy </ORGANIZATION>, has drawn big crowds that have defied martial law to hear her speak in <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION>. Under existing military law, gatherings of more than five people are forbidden. `` General <PERSON> Saw </PERSON> <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> and U Ne Win have identical views in their disregard for dialogue and civil authority,'' <PERSON> Suu </PERSON> <PERSON> Kyi </PERSON> said. Residents said many people stayed indoors to avoid anticipated clashes and some shops in the city closed during the afternoon. But witnesses said the military appeared to be keeping a low profile and did not attempt to prevent political leaders from speaking. On Wednesday, more than 10,000 Burmese rallied to hear <PERSON> Suu </PERSON> <PERSON> Kyi </PERSON> speak in what Rangoon-based diplomats said was the largest political gathering since last September.

 Police today shot and killed three escaped convicts and captured three others after the group tried to rob a bank, then hijacked a bus and took a 12-year-old boy hostage, officials said. The shootout ended a chase that began Thursday when the six men tried to rob a branch of the <ORGANIZATION> Bahia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Uaua </LOCATION>, in northeastern <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>, said the head of the <ORGANIZATION> Bahia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Anselmo </PERSON>. The men, armed with revolvers and a shotgun, had escaped from the medium-security <PERSON> Lemos </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Brito </PERSON> penitentiary, <PERSON> Anselmo </PERSON> said by telephone from the state capital, <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>. The men stopped a bus carrying about 40 passengers and ordered the driver to head for <PERSON> Conceicao </PERSON> do Coite, a city of 60,000 people 200 miles away, <PERSON> Anselmo </PERSON> said. In Conceicao do Coite, scores of police surrounded the bus and exchanged gunfire with the hijackers. Three passengers were slightly injured, said a city official, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferreira </PERSON>. Before dawn today, the hijackers took several hostages from the bus and fled in a car provided by local authorities. Outside of town, they released all the hostages except a 12-year-old boy, then abandoned the car and fled on foot through the brush, <PERSON> Ferreira </PERSON> said. Police tracked the group to a remote cottage, surrounded it and opened fire, killing three of the escapees and capturing the others, <PERSON> Ferreira </PERSON> said. He said the hostage was released unharmed. `` This was a little paradise. There's never been anything like this here before,'' said <PERSON> Ferreira </PERSON>. `` Today's a holiday for the town's anniversary, but now the celebration is ruined.''

 Community leaders today broke ground for a memorial to 14 people who were killed in the collapse of a three-story department store during a torrential rain a year ago today. `` For a brief moment in our day-to-day lives, everybody in this community stopped ... to climb upon a rock pile and rub elbows with some of the people that they pass on a day-to-day basis without ever stopping,'' said <PERSON> Rusty </PERSON> <PERSON> Faulk </PERSON>, who was local disaster chairman for the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION>. Residents gathered this morning to remember the 14 people who died July 7, 1988, when the <ORGANIZATION> Amigo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Store </ORGANIZATION> collapsed in this border town. At least 47 other people were injured. The memorial, which includes a palm tree planted near the former store for each of the victims, was donated by the <ORGANIZATION> Rotary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brownsville-Sunrise </ORGANIZATION>. The memorial also honors the survivors and hundreds of people who joined the rescue effort. Mayor <PERSON> Ygnacio </PERSON> <PERSON> Garza </PERSON>, who in the past year has also led the city through a hurricane and a series of drug cult murders at nearby <LOCATION> Matamoros </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, said people from out of town most often ask about the Amigo Store disaster. `` They remember how the community responded, how we worked together to save lives,'' <PERSON> Garza </PERSON> said. Store owner <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Levin </PERSON>, who was in the building when it collapsed, escaped unscathed but said the thought of death and suffering remain. `` Naturally, I feel a little beat,'' <PERSON> Levin </PERSON> said Wednesday. `` It's very hard for me to keep going Like today, it poured down raining and I thought back to the Amigo Store.'' Dr. <PERSON> Carmen </PERSON> <PERSON> Rocco </PERSON>, who treated survivors and consoled families while rescuers clawed through the rubble, said she recalls events just before the disaster and after the site was cleared. `` In between, there was so much pain and so much tragedy that I really blocked it out,'' she said. `` All I really remember is an incredible thunderstorm, and today we had one of those.'' All that remains at the site a year later is vinyl flooring, the tiles at the entrance and a gaping hole in the downtown business district. <PERSON> Levin </PERSON> faces personal injury lawsuits seeking millions of dollars in damages. The city, <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Utilities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> and various construction firms and suppliers have been named as defendants, too. Among the survivors was 32-year-old Mexican <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Gaytan </PERSON> who suffered brain damage while trapped in the rubble and no longer is able to teach school, said <PERSON> Ernesto </PERSON> <PERSON> Gamez </PERSON>, his attorney. No official report has been released to explain what caused the three-story structure to collapse in a storm that dumped two inches of rain on the city in 30 minutes. The store was built in 1969 and the third floor added in 1975. Dr. <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> <PERSON> Pelly </PERSON>, who hitchhiked to the scene from <ORGANIZATION> Brownsville </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, said: `` The first thing I saw there was a guy who had his face crushed between a parking meter and a car parked there on the street.'' <PERSON> Pelly </PERSON> said the outpouring of volunteers from throughout the lower <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Grande </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> united the region, but he regrets the bickering among rescuers and the decision to dig instead of looking first for survivors. Survivors were not located until hours later.

 The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> uncovered more than a 1 -LCB- tons of cocaine in a hidden compartment of a Panamanian freighter in one of its biggest drug busts ever, a spokesman said today. `` This is a tremendous seizure for us. We're ecstatic,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> Lt. <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Karonis </PERSON>. The freighter <PERSON> Barlovento </PERSON> left <LOCATION> Tampico </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, earlier this week headed for the <LOCATION> Dominican </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> and following a major drug trafficking route. It was intercepted about 350 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> after <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Customs </ORGANIZATION> aircraft tracked it with the help of a ship-mounted radar balloon. `` The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> went to the <ORGANIZATION> Panamanian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and we were given approval to go ahead and board the ship,'' <PERSON> Karonis </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> cutters Shearwater and <PERSON> Citkinak </PERSON> failed to find contraband in their initial search so they brought the 162-foot vessel to <LOCATION> Key </LOCATION> <LOCATION> West </LOCATION>, he said. The cocaine was found Thursday night hidden between fuel and water tanks in a sealed compartment, <PERSON> Karonis </PERSON> said. `` They searched and searched and searched and finally found 3,359 pounds of cocaine,'' he said. `` That is a tremendous amount, one of the biggest the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> has ever made, if not the biggest. We're still trying to determine that. The Colombian master of the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> City-registered ship was arrested, along with another Colombian, one Panamanian and seven crew members from the <LOCATION> Dominican </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Karonis </PERSON> said. Other large seizures of cocaine in recent years include about 7,300 pounds that were found in hollowed-out lumber at a <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> area warehouse in the spring of 1988; 6,237 pounds seized on a Venzuelan freighter and in a container that had been removed from the vessel that docked in <LOCATION> Port </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Everglades </LOCATION> in October 1986; and more than 5,000 pounds seized from banana crates at a <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> produce market in July 1987.

 Moslem leaders said today they will ask <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> for surface-to-surface missiles and tanks to counter new missiles reportedly acquired from <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> by their <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> foes. Syrian artillery shells continued to besiege the coast of the Christian enclave north of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> today. Police said two people were killed and seven wounded. The deaths raise the toll to 404 people killed and 1,558 wounded since fighting erupted March 8 between the mainly Christian troops of Gen. <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s Lebanese army and Syrian-backed militiamen. Tension also heightened amid reports that 42 Christians were kidnapped in Moslem sectors after Syrian-backed Moslem forces lifted a land blockade of the Christian heartland two days ago. The <ORGANIZATION> An-Nahar </ORGANIZATION> newspaper reported the kidnappings, and <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s command said the report was true But police said they knew about no abductions. <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>'s barrage of Christian ports is to prevent <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> from receiving armaments, but <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Moslem </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Nabih </PERSON> <PERSON> Berri </PERSON> declared today that the Christians on Thursday received a shipload of Soviet-designed Frog-7 missiles and T-54 and T-55 tanks from <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Berri </PERSON>, leader of the mainstream <ORGANIZATION> Amal </ORGANIZATION> militia and <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>'s closest ally in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, was speaking in <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION>, after meeting with Lebanese Druse warlord <PERSON> Walid </PERSON> <PERSON> Jumblatt </PERSON>. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s command refused to comment on the report he has acquired the missiles, which have a range of 43 miles and can carry warheads containing 1,210 pounds of explosive. <PERSON> Berri </PERSON> charged the Christians will deploy the new armaments against Moslem forces. `` They're not to threaten <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> or any other country,'' he said. `` They're to be used against the Lebanese and the parties of the national coalition,'' an alliance of six Moslem parties. <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> this week charged Christian forces received six Frog-7 missiles in April and demanded they be removed because they could hit <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION> if fired from Christian-held positions in mountains northeast of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. The mountains are 40 miles from <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Berri </PERSON> claimed Christian missiles are `` aimed at my house, the house of <PERSON> Walid </PERSON> <PERSON> Jumblatt </PERSON> and at the Syrian headquarters'' in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. He said he has not officially asked <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> for the missiles and is waiting for President <PERSON> Hafez </PERSON> <PERSON> Assad </PERSON> to return from his summer residence `` in order to put this request to him.'' `` The Syrians must help us. We are their allies. If they can not, or will not, then it is our right to seek to purchase such advanced weapons from any source,'' <PERSON> Berri </PERSON> told reporters. A statement from his Amal militia published by <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> newspapers said acquisition of the missiles would `` lead to a destructive catastrophe that will not spare areas in east or west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>.''

 <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact nations today asked <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> to present President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s arms reduction initiatives at the East-West disarmament talks. Officials said they hope details of the proposal will be submitted before next week, when the current round of talks is to end. `` We're pressing strongly that they present the framework of the proposals by the end of this round on July 13,'' said <PERSON> Wlodzimierz </PERSON> <PERSON> Konarski </PERSON>, Polish delegation chief at the talks on conventional armed forces in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. In May, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> won <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> support for a proposal to reduce <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet troops in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> to 275,000 on each side. That would require the Soviets to withdraw and demobilize 325,000 Red Army soldiers. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also proposed limits on tanks, armored troop carriers and artillery pieces. And he said the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> is willing to expand its proposal to include, for the first time, land-based combat aircraft and helicopters from the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> to the Soviet Ural mountains. Western experts at the Western alliance headquarters in <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION> said last month they would formally present <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s proposals to the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact when talks open for their third round on Sept. 5. <PERSON> Konarski </PERSON>, speaking for the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc, was optimistic about progress but mentioned some differences. `` We all now agree that a future agreement should cover six categories of conventional armed forces even though a formal proposal of our Western partners to this effect has not yet been submitted,'' <PERSON> Konarski </PERSON> told reporters. He said if the main obstacles were overcome during the next round `` then the agreement could indeed be concluded within 12 months,'' the timetable suggested by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> opened the <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> talks on conventional arms reductions March 9 proposing each military bloc reduce three kinds of weapons _ tanks, artillery and armored personnel carriers. The Soviet military bloc countered with a far broader, less specific proposal to reduce six kinds of weapons 10 percent to 15 percent below present levels by 1994, then add a further 25 percent reduction by 1997 before moving to only defensive forces in 2000. Reductions in aircraft are among points of disagreement. Western delegates say aircraft are difficult to count and can be redeployed in any disarmed zone within hours. <PERSON> Konarski </PERSON> made clear the issue is of vital importance for the future of the talks. `` The issue of aircraft remains to be solved as a matter of priority,'' he said.

 Gunmen believed to be communist rebels killed a provincial police chief and a sergeant today, authorities said. The Philippine Constabulary said Capt. <PERSON> Nick </PERSON> <PERSON> Enterina </PERSON> and Sgt. <PERSON> Rogato </PERSON> <PERSON> Garido </PERSON> were shot to death as they were chatting in the street near the police station in <LOCATION> Iligan </LOCATION> city, 500 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>.

Also today, a general said he has ordered a closer guard on 31 soldiers held in the slaying of President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>'s husband, following reports that three had been seen at the airport. On June 24, a <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> tabloid newspaper, People's Tonight, said the defendants went to the airport to smuggle textiles, automotive parts and guns. Airport manager <PERSON> Eduardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Carrascoso </PERSON> and customs collector <PERSON> Zafiro </PERSON> <PERSON> Respicio </PERSON> told a special anti-corruption court today their subordinates reported the three soldiers had often been seen at the airport. The soldiers are supposed to be kept under guard at <ORGANIZATION> Villamor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Pasay </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> just outside <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>. The defendants are charged with killing <PERSON> Benigno </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> on Aug. 21, 1983. He was shot while under military escort as he left a jet that brought him back from three years of self-imposed exile in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The defendants' first trial ended in December 1985 with acquittals. However, after Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> took power in February 1986, the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> overturned the original verdict and ordered a new trial. Brig. Gen. <PERSON> Rogelio </PERSON> <PERSON> Estacio </PERSON>, the <PERSON> Villamor </PERSON> commander, denied the prisoners were allowed to leave their quarters, but he said controls had been tightened. `` Before, we checked the roll at 7 o'clock in the evening,'' he told reporters. `` Now, we do it every three hours.'' The retrial began in April 1987. A total of 37 people are accused of the murder, but six are free on bail or under house arrest.

 The <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> ruled today that a West German accused of killing two people in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> should not be extradited to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> because he could receive the death penalty. The court said the threat of the death penalty is a violation of <PERSON> Jens </PERSON> <PERSON> Soering </PERSON>'s human rights. Soering is being held in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. Rulings by the court do not technically bind the members of the Council of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, but they are rarely ignored. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> said it would study the ruling. Court officials called the judgment a landmark ruling because the court normally issues such decisions only after a human rights abuse has occurred. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Updike </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Bedford </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, prosecutor heading the case against Soering, said the decision was `` illogical.'' `` He is guilty of the extremely brutal murder of two human beings,'' <PERSON> Updike </PERSON> told The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. The court said if Soering is found guilty in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, he faces years on death row and capital punishment. Such punishment would breach his rights under the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Convention </ORGANIZATION>, it said. Article 3 of the charter says: `` No one shall be subjected to torture or to inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.'' Sending 22-year-old Soering to <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> `` would expose him to a real risk of treatment going beyond the threshold set by Article 3,'' the court ruled. It said a promise by <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> justice officials to ask the courts to spare his life if he is found guilty was insufficient because it `` did not eliminate the risk of a death sentence.'' Soering, who moved to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in 1977, was charged in the March 30, 1985, killings of <PERSON> William </PERSON> and <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Haysom </PERSON> in their <LOCATION> Bedford </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> home. They were the parents of <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Haysom </PERSON>, his girlfriend at the time. She is serving a 90-year sentence for her part in the killings. The parents of Soering's girlfried were stabbed to death in an argument over Soering's relationship with their daughter, which the parents opposed. Soering evaded arrest in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> but was arrested in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> in April 1986 on a check fraud charge. In 1988, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> agreed to extradite him, but <PERSON> Soering </PERSON> took his case to the human rights court, an arm of the 23-nation Council of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> is likely now to send Soering back to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, which requested his extradition in 1987 to let him stand trial there for the <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> murders. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, a spokesman for the Home Office, which handles law enforcement and immigration, said only that the ruling will be studied. `` We will need to consider the judgment fully and carefully,'' he said. One consideration for <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> is its interest in preserving the 1986 extradition treaty with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> is currently seeking extradition of an <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> member convicted of murder in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> who later escaped from prison and was arrested in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> did not say what <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> should do with Soering. But Judge <PERSON> Rolf </PERSON> <PERSON> Ryssdal </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION>, the court president who read the ruling, said trying Soering in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> `` would not involve suffering of such exceptional intensity or duration.'' <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> abolished the death sentence in 1949. Under its laws, nationals can be tried for crimes in another country. If convicted in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, Soering faces a maximum prison sentence of 10 to 15 years.

The <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> ruled <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> from 1975 to 1979, when it was ousted by a Vietnamese invasion. During that time, it killed hundreds of thousands of people. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, Western allies, and the regional association have been forging a common stand before an international conference on <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> to be held in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> tentatively starting July 30. They are urging a cease-fire, power-sharing, and an international body supervised by the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> to oversee elections and the transition to peace. <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> has opposed such a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> role. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> has confirmed it will send its foreign minister to the conference, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>'s Deputy Foreign Minister <PERSON> Edwige </PERSON> <PERSON> Avice </PERSON> announced. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s role is crucial because it is the main source of arms for the guerilla coalition. The <ORGANIZATION> ASEAN </ORGANIZATION> foreign ministers welcomed the news. `` This presence is one of the conditions of the success of the conference,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Avice </PERSON>. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> also said Vietnamese refugees are pouring into Asian nations because of conditions in their homeland. `` We should keep up pressure on it to reform its political and economic system,'' he said. The secretary of <ORGANIZATION> state </ORGANIZATION> also tried today to reassure the <LOCATION> Southeast </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> leaders who fear the major powers will dominate a proposed economic alliance for the region, officials said. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> gave the assurances in separate talks with Foreign Minister <PERSON> Siddhi </PERSON> <PERSON> Savetsila </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> and Foreign Minister <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Hassan </PERSON> <PERSON> Omar </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION>. The association comprises the non-communist, rapidly developing nations of <LOCATION> Brunei </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION>. The dialogue partners are the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION> and the 12-nation European Community. In the talks, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> have been seeking reactions to their separate proposals for a new forum on economic cooperation for the <LOCATION> Asia-Pacific </LOCATION> region. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> told <PERSON> Siddhi </PERSON> the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> does not intend to dominate the economies of the smaller countries because the purpose of any new group would be to stimulate the free flow of goods and commodities, according to <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Spokesman </ORGANIZATION> Jetn Sucharitkul of <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>. Some group members, including <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION>, also say they want to avoid sensitive political questions, such as whether <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> or rival <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> should be invited to join.

 A White House official has been told to stop dealing with certain aspects of the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION>'s budget because she is under congressional scrutiny for projects she handled while working at the scandal-scarred agency. <PERSON> Janet </PERSON> <PERSON> Hale </PERSON> was informed of the move late Thursday by budget director <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Darman </PERSON>, not long after she was notified that she would be asked to appear before a congressional subcommittee investigating allegations of mismangement at <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> during the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration. Ms. <PERSON> Hale </PERSON> works in the Office of Management and Budget and her duties, until Thursday, included oversight of the entire <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> budget. Before moving to the White House she worked for several years at <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION>, rising to deputy assistant secretary of housing. <PERSON> Darman </PERSON>'s action came a day after <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> announced the suspension of a third agency program, providing housing for low and moderate-income elderly people, as part of the probe of corruption and mismanagement at the department. <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Clay </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> OMB </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman, said today that Ms. <PERSON> Hale </PERSON> was told not to handle any <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> matters that relate to the investigation but can continue to work on other agency activities. Congressional investigators are looking into at least two projects Ms. <PERSON> Hale </PERSON> handled while at <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION>, including approval of a <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> project involving a longtime friend of former <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>. `` For the time being, any matters specifically involving the <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> investigation or the <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> actions under investigation should be handled ... without your involvement,'' <PERSON> Darman </PERSON> said in a note to Ms. <PERSON> Hale </PERSON>. He noted that Ms. <PERSON> Hale </PERSON> herself had suggested the reassignment after being summoned by the subcommittee. `` I have concluded that this is the the best interest of <ORGANIZATION> OMB </ORGANIZATION> _ and I'm inclined to think that for the periodf of the investigation it is also in your own best interest,'' the <ORGANIZATION> OMB </ORGANIZATION> director said. The memo was first reported in today's editions of The <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Globe </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>'s decision Thursday on the elderly-housing program follows a highly critical audit of the program by <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION>'s inspector general that said many of the projects were approved despite warnings by agency analysts that they were unnecessary or too large. The program already has cost the government $ 119 million in direct payments to cover defaults on HUD-insured mortgages, <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> said. The cost is likely to grow, he said, because defaults now total $ 250 million and are expected to continue. <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> also said the program was not serving those it was created to help, citing a HUD-backed project in <LOCATION> Palm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, that he said charged $ 2,100 a month rent for a two-bedroom apartment. He promised to revive the <ORGANIZATION> Retirement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Program </ORGANIZATION> after rewriting its guidelines to target resources to low-income elderly. `` Insured housing programs administered by <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> must by their nature take risks,'' <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> said. `` With this program costing $ 120 million to date, I would rather take these risks by targeting resources ... to lower-income people.'' <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> is reviewing <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> programs as <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and law enforcement officials investigate allegations of widespread mismanagement during the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration. Testimony and other evidence shows influential Republican consultants were hired by developers to win favor for <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> projects. Also Thursday, an aide to the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee investigating <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> and calling Ms. <PERSON> Hale </PERSON> to testify said several prior witnesses will be recalled, including former <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>. <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> earlier told the subcommittee he had no direct role in funding decisions. But a former agency official, <PERSON> Shirley </PERSON> <PERSON> McVay </PERSON> <PERSON> Wiseman </PERSON>, since has said <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> ordered her to approve funding for a <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> project involving a longtime <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> associate. Also among those to be recalled are <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Demery </PERSON>, former assistant secretary for housing; <PERSON> Lance </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>'s former top aide; and <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> political consultant <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Manafort </PERSON>, who has admitted `` influence-peddling'' to secure <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> funding for a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> project. The congressional investigation has focused largely on three programs: <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION>'s acquisition and sale of single-family property, its funding for rehabilitation of rental properties and its co-insuring of mortgages for certain housing developments. A dozen private closing agents contracted for the single-family program are under investigation for allegedly bilking the agency of $ 20 million or more. <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> has suspended the rehabilitation program and canceled another program in which <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> backed loans for such projects as a golf course-residential complex. Both involved lobbying by prominent Republicans. The five-year-old elderly housing venture involved 150 developments. <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> said he suspended it because 30 percent of the projects whose mortgages were fully backed by <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> and another 12 percent of those in which <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> guaranteed 80 percent of the loan were in default. The second default rate is expected to climb, officials say. The program was designed to provide housing to people over age 70 who can live on their own and afford market rents. The centers offer such services as central dining and recreation. An audit of 24 retirement centers in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> found six were in default or had their mortgages assigned to <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION>, and six were considered financially troubled. In most of those cases, <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> field offices approved the number of apartments sought by developers although agency economists warned the local housing market could not support the full project. In one case, <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> assumed mortgage payments for a <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> facility that <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> economists had recommended be rejected. Only 76 of the complex's 208 units were rented as of May 1988, 19 months after it opened. The economist who recommended rejection had noted the development would be in an isolated area overlooking a gravel pit, `` clearly remote from major population centers.'' The audit did not identify the project by name and <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> officials at the field office that handled the case did not return telephone calls Thursday. In another case, auditors said the <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> office agreed to insure a 254-unit development despite an agency economist's findings that the market would support just 125 units In May 1988, nearly three years after <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Village </LOCATION> opened, only 67 of the 254 units were occupied and the mortgage was in default. The report listed four projects in <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION> with mortgages totaling $ 35.2 million and two others in the Minneapolis-St. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> area totaling $ 17.9 million that were `` in default or considered financially troubled.

 The Secret Service searched the home of one of its White House guards after he acknowledged he escorted a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> businessman and his associates on late-night tours of the executive mansion. <ORGANIZATION> Secret </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Rich </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> today confirmed that the service, which protects President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and other high-ranking officials, searched the home of <PERSON> Reginald </PERSON> A. deGueldre Thursday night. <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> declined to provide details of the search. DeGueldre is a uniformed agent at the White House. `` There's been no arrest, so we ca n't release any information involving our investigation until that time,'' <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> has reported that deGueldre led businessman <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Spence </PERSON> and his friends on at least one late-night White House tour. The newspaper also has linked <PERSON> Spence </PERSON> to a police investigation of a male prostitution ring operating in the city. The <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>, in today's editions, said five agents searched deGueldre's <LOCATION> Oakton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, home and took dozens of photographs. In an interview with the newspaper, deGueldre said he had been asked by his superiors and the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney's office whether he had received gifts from or did private security work for Spence. He said he told officials that he received no gratuities from <LOCATION> Spence </LOCATION> and performed no favors other than arranging and conducting late-night tours of the White House during the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration. `` <PERSON> Spence </PERSON> was just a friend of mine,'' he told the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>. `` I took him and his friends on the tours. He never gave me anything. I never worked for him.'' The officer also confirmed that he was asked if he had any knowledge of the prostitution ring. He declined to elaborate. An unidentified <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> spokesman has said that private late-night tours of the executive mansion are not unususal and do not pose security risks.

 The father of two former <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> aides testified in their tax-evasion trial that they gave him and his wife a Cadillac, jewelry and furs, and trips to <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>. <PERSON> David </PERSON> and <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Taggart </PERSON>, friends of <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> founder <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>, are charged with failing to pay $ 487,000 in income taxes from 1984 to 1987. Federal prosecutors say they diverted $ 1.1 million of ministry funds to their personal use by taking cash advances on <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> credit cards and using blank ministry checks to pay the credit card bills. <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Taggart </PERSON>'s testimony established that the claims of family wealth recalled by his sons' co-workers at <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> were false. `` Let me put this to rest once and for all,'' <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Taggart </PERSON> said. `` I do not and never did own seven Cadillac dealerships. `` I did not and never did own one Cadillac dealership. I worked for a Cadillac dealer. That's it.'' Today, an attorney hired by <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> to fight an effort by the <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> to revoke the ministry's tax-exempt status testified that he was unable to obtain documents on credit card cash advances and <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> charges that dealt specifically with <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Taggart </PERSON>. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Wigton </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> specialist in exempt organizations who is now in private practice, was retained by <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> in late 1985 to fight the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION>'s proposed revocation of <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION>'s tax-exempt status. The <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> action stemmed from an audit of <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> of the years 1981-1983. In other testimony Thursday, <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> tax attorney <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gunst </PERSON> testified that <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Taggart </PERSON> bought $ 100,000 worth of jewelry and $ 400,000 in other purchases the same year he told the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> his taxable income was $ 107,000. `` Did the defendant ever tell you how he could purchase items worth $ 500,000 when his income was $ 100,000?'' prosecutor <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> asked. `` It looks like a mistake was made,'' said <PERSON> Gunst </PERSON>, who prepared <PERSON> Taggart </PERSON>'s 1984 tax return. Other purchases questioned Thursday included a one-bedroom apartment on the 57th floor of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s Trump Tower, which <PERSON> Gunst </PERSON> said the two brothers bought in 1986 for $ 640,000. <PERSON> Gunst </PERSON> also said that <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> approved using ministry funds to pay $ 52,000 in back taxes and penalties levied against <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Taggart </PERSON> following an audit of his 1981 and 1982 tax returns. <PERSON> Gunst </PERSON> said he found 25 to 30 boxes of credit card receipts during an <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> audit of the ministry, and was worried that spending by the <PERSON> Taggart </PERSON> brothers could threaten <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION>'s tax-exempt status. `` The receipts were there,'' <PERSON> Gunst </PERSON> said. `` The issue was whether there was substantiation.'' `` I told him the importance of keeping good records,'' <PERSON> Gunst </PERSON> said. `` I do n't know if he was the main problem. It looked to me that he had provided the documents to support his travel.'' Both <PERSON> Taggarts </PERSON> joined the ministry in the late 1970s as pianists. Within a few years, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Taggart </PERSON>, 32, had become <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>'s top aide and <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Taggart </PERSON>, 35, was the ministry's interior designer. Both were fired after <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> resigned in 1987 amid a sex and money scandal. If convicted, they each could face 25 years in prison and fines of more than $ 1 million. In his testimony today, <PERSON> Wigton </PERSON> described one incident in which he was unable to get his hands on <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> receipts. A set of copies he requested from the credit card company was lost at <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION>. A second set of copies also was reported lost by <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> officials, he said. `` They just disappeared,'' said <PERSON> Wigton </PERSON>. Most of the missing records had to do with travel expenses and other charges incurred by <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Taggart </PERSON>, he said. Without the records, <PERSON> Wigton </PERSON> said, his effort to fight the proposed <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> action was `` hampered significantly.'' Under cross-examination by defense attorney <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Cotten </PERSON>, <PERSON> Wigton </PERSON> acknowledged that other records were also missing.

<HEAD>Baltic Republic Steps Beyond Kremlin in Decollectivizing Land</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The parliament of Soviet <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION> passed a law this week that goes a step beyond national legislation in giving land back to farmers after decades of collectization, newspapers reported Friday. The law stops short of total decollectivization, but would _ without charge _ give farmers the land they farm now with the right to pass it on to heirs, according to <ORGANIZATION> Sovietskaya </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Litva </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Lithuanian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> daily. The law does not allow farmers to sell land, a step the <ORGANIZATION> Kremlin </ORGANIZATION> might view as a violation of the communist ban on ownership of major private property. Soviet farms have been owned by the state or by state-controlled collectives since 1929-30. The bill could strengthen efforts by the Baltic republics of <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Lativa </LOCATION> to become more autonomous. They were occupied and annexed by the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> in 1940. It was not clear whether the national legislature, the Supreme Soviet, would try to override the new Lithuanian law in the same way it vetoed a law passed by the legislature of <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION> last fall proclaiming autonomy in the republic. The Lithuanian law, which has not yet been published in full, went beyond national legislation passed in April allowing farmers to rent land on 50-year leases with a right to pass it on to descendants. Farmers have been slow to take out leases, fearing the reforms could be overturned, according to poll results published in April by the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> daily newspaper Pravda. The Lithuanian law, according to the newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Izvestia </ORGANIZATION>, said `` land, granted to the peasant for use with no fixed term, with rights of inheritance and without payment, does not include the right to sale.'' Activists in the Lithuanian grassroots political group <ORGANIZATION> Sajudis </ORGANIZATION> had been pushing for more radical legislation that would have granted farmers the right to buy and sell land, but a compromise was reached in the republic's legislature, said <PERSON> Zhilvenas </PERSON> <PERSON> Glebus </PERSON>, reached by telephone in the Lithuanian capital of <LOCATION> Vilnius </LOCATION>. The Lithuanian law will go into effect Aug. 1, according to <ORGANIZATION> Sajudis </ORGANIZATION> workers, quoting the Sovietskaya Litva article.

 When the British middle classes want to know how they're talking, dressing, loving and hating, they need only head for the latest <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Ayckbourn </PERSON> play. In three decades of playwriting, he has moved beyond his early acclaim as a clever farceur to become the voice of an age and a people.

The 1980s have <PERSON> Ayckbourn </PERSON>, dissecting the underside of the entrepreneurial society championed by Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> with his savagely witty depictions of the suburban nouveaux riches and his ear for the way middle-class Britons speak. His work has been performed in over 35 countries, and he was most recently seen in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> with the off-Broadway hit `` Woman in Mind'' last year. He also writes children's plays, mini-musicals and revues. He was <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Webber </PERSON>'s collaborator on the composer's one flop to date, `` Jeeves,'' and has directed as well, notably <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>'s `` A View From the Bridge. With the June 13 opening of `` The Revengers' Comedies,'' the 50-year-old playwright has arrived _ presenting a two-part, 5 -LCB- - hour morality tale that is winning rave reviews It's his 37th play, the same number <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Shakespeare </PERSON> wrote. But it is quality, not quantity, for which <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s busiest dramatist hopes to be remembered. `` I hope my plays hold up in 400 years. That's the real test,'' he said in an interview. The Independent in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> found it `` killingly funny ... masterly.'' The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> said `` <PERSON> Ayckbourn </PERSON> has outdone himself'' and paid tribute to `` the most extraordinary career in contemporary English playwriting.'' The play, which wo n't reach <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s West End until 1991, was launched at the <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Theater </PERSON> in the Round in the north <LOCATION> Yorkshire </LOCATION> seaside town of <LOCATION> Scarborough </LOCATION>, where it will run through Sept. 23. <PERSON> Scarborough </PERSON> is entirely in character with a man whose plays are rooted in a sense of place and who himself has little time for the pretensions of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s social circuit. <PERSON> Ayckbourn </PERSON> became the theater's artistic director in 1971. `` I'm a chronicler of small communities,'' he said. `` One sees events and people and the rise and fall of individuals in a town such as this.'' `` The Revengers' Comedies'' begins with a chance encounter by two people intent on suicide and examines the consequences of a revenge pact that leaves careers, houses, and people in ruins. As the plot thickens, the tone darkens, subverting any notion of <PERSON> Ayckbourn </PERSON> as a British <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>. A similar mix of comedy and tragedy characterizes `` Henceforward ...,'' his current West End hit, about a composer writing a symphony of love as the world around him slides into hatred, and `` A Small Family Business,'' which takes comic aim at the English bourgeoisie. Both plays have <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> productions on tap. `` Henceforward ...,'' which had a 1987 run at <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>'s Alley Theater, will be staged in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> next spring. `` A Small Family Business'' is headed for <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> in 1990. These works have led to a reassessment by critics who have tended to see <PERSON> Ayckbourn </PERSON> as little more than a laugh machine. The reappraisal became noticeable after `` Woman in Mind,'' his rending study of a housewife driven mad by her banal suburban surroundings. But the hand of a social anatomist can be seen as far back as 1972 in `` Absurd Person Singular,'' in which the vanities and class wars of three couples are traced over three Christmases. `` The Norman Conquests'' in 1973 showed his technical virtuosity, presenting the same story in three intricately linked plays, each time from the viewpoint of a different participant at a family gathering. His 1982 `` Intimate Exchanges'' had several different endings depending on the toss of a coin. <PERSON> Ayckbourn </PERSON> is celebrated for his craftsmanship _ `` I am interested in technique; I just do n't want it to show too much'' _ but says content is paramount. `` I think I'm a moral dramatist,'' he said. `` Absurd Person Singular'' was `` the first time I noticed it in myself ... the story of the triumph of Mammon, a theme that's cropped up a lot since.'' Although his characters never mention Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> by name, they are almost without exception steeped in her capitalist ethos. `` I'm alarmed and worried by some of the attitudes that have come out of that philosophy, but I think it's wider than her; she bears the title,'' he said. Less preachy than leftist colleagues <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Hare </PERSON>, <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Brenton </PERSON> and <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> <PERSON> Lucie </PERSON>, <PERSON> Ayckbourn </PERSON> calls himself `` a woolly liberal in the middle.'' `` It's a little like doing anti-Tory plays at miners' galas: There's no point,'' he said. `` I should be doing plays for Conservative clubs, but in order to do so, you've got to get in there with a slow-burning fuse.'' `` I hope in the end one says the right thing, if you like: that money and power are dangerous not inherently of themselves but in the using of them.'' This autumn will see the movie version of his 1984 play `` A Chorus of Disapproval,'' directed by <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Winner </PERSON> and starring <PERSON> Jeremy </PERSON> <PERSON> Irons </PERSON> and <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Hopkins </PERSON>. It's <PERSON> Ayckbourn </PERSON>'s debut as a screenwriter, but he remains committed to the stage. `` In the end, film does n't seem to add much to my work. It replaces my narrative with a narrative of its own,'' he said. `` Things inevitably disappear.'' `` The theater is where I get my buzz from. I just get excited with all the bricks and mortar of it.''

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> newspaper reacted angrily to remarks by <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s finance minister that <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> should be reunified within its 1937 borders, which include about a third of <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. Finance Minister <PERSON> Theo </PERSON> <PERSON> Waigel </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Hanover </LOCATION> on Sunday that the German Reich in its borders of 1937 did not cease to exist with the German army's 1945 capitulation to the Allies. <PERSON> Waigel </PERSON> said his party, the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, would never allow the demand for reunification of the two Germanies to be stricken from the West German Constitution. If the old German borders were recognized, <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> would lose some of its largest cities, such as Wroclaw and <LOCATION> Szczecin </LOCATION>, and its biggest industrial region in southeastern <LOCATION> Silesia </LOCATION>. `` Questioning at a revisionist rally the map of postwar <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and the irreversible character of the border on the <ORGANIZATION> Odra </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Nysa </LOCATION> rivers, Minister <PERSON> Waigel </PERSON>, as a government representative, strikes at our fundamental national and state rationale,'' said the editorial in the Polish <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Trybuna </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ludu </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday. `` Such a line ... is unacceptable for the Polish nation and for all Poles regardless of their political orientation.'' Although <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> has been the most active Western country in promoting relations with the communist countries of Central and <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, Polish-West German relations have been strained by a host of bilateral issues. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> wants better treatment for the German minority that remained in the former German territories after World War II, and there is resentment toward the flood of Polish emigrants or illegal workers who have taken advantage of liberalized passport laws to travel to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> has accused <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> of insensitivity to its sovereignty because of the calls by rightist politicians for old German territories and because of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s refusal to grant economic assistance unless <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> makes concessions on the minorities issue. In <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION> today, a leading Solidarity official urged Polish reconciliation with <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> but said his country should not give up any land. `` Those who question existing borders damage perspectives for stability in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Bronislaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Geremek </PERSON>, leader of Solidarity's deputies in the Polish parliament. <PERSON> Geremek </PERSON> also said he sees `` new chances for -LRB- closer -RRB- relations between Germans and Poles,'' and that problems holding up an agreement in ongoing bilateral talks `` are only of the second order.''

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>'s attorney general called today for a federal investigation of price-fixing by major oil companies, saying a state probe showed either greed or collusion is behind recent price increases. `` Greed is n't illegal, but price fixing is, and that has been the focus of our investigation here in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>,'' Attorney General <PERSON> Lacy </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburg </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Thornburg </PERSON> said the oil companies have blamed the wreck of the Exxon Valdez in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> and normal market forces such as increased summer demand and higher crude oil prices for the rapid increase in gasoline prices over the past four months. But <PERSON> Thornburg </PERSON> said <PERSON> Valdez </PERSON> spill `` was simply a small drop in a very large bucket.'' He said crude oil prices have not affected prices for other petroleum products, such as heating oil and diesel fuel. `` The oil companies have put forward other excuses for the simultaneous gas price increases, but their arguments have more holes than the hull of the Exxon Valdez,'' <PERSON> Thornburg </PERSON> said. He said investigators tracked prices for three months from retailers back through wholesale terminals and the major out-of-state suppliers, finding that price increases took place at the refinery level, while profits of wholesalers and retailers remained stable. <PERSON> Thornburg </PERSON> said he had forwarded the state's investigation and a formal request for a federal investigation to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney General <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> official said he also will ask his counterparts in other states at a meeting this weekend to form a task force to examine the price fixing allegations. `` I anticipate we will get a good response from the federal government,'' <PERSON> Thornburg </PERSON> said. `` We can demonstrate with other states a general outcry around the country, and when you have a widespread public outcry, you usually can get a positive response. `` It is awfully difficult to prove price-fixing. It always has been,'' <PERSON> Thornburg </PERSON> said. `` But we're certainly going to give it our best shot.''

 An international customs organization wants customs procedures around the globe automated through the use of electronic data systems, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Customs Service Commissioner <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> von </PERSON> <PERSON> Raab </PERSON> said Friday. <PERSON> Von </PERSON> <PERSON> Raab </PERSON> said the 104-nation <ORGANIZATION> Customs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cooperation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, at meetings here this week, also adopted resolutions urging strict enforcement of drug laws and encouraging member countries to sign a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> convention on illicit drug trafficking. He told a news conference that `` the council has approved a strategy through which customs administrations around the world can work toward electronic data interchange.'' `` When it comes, goods and services will move across international borders mostly without paperwork, and with the absolute minimum of human involvement. National laws and regulations that interfere with free movement of goods and services will give way to laws designed for modern trade and information concepts,'' <PERSON> von </PERSON> <PERSON> Raab </PERSON> said. He said that `` the bottom line will be less expensive international trade. Trade will be less expensive for the business community, which means lower prices for us all.

On drugs, the international organization adopted a resolution urging member nations to `` focus attention on the smugglers of small quantities of illicit drugs as well as on the smugglers of large quantities.''

 A Cuban military court today condemned a former army general and three other former officers to death by firing squad for drug trafficking, the official Cuban news agency <ORGANIZATION> Prensa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Latina </ORGANIZATION> said. The tribunal handed out sentences ranging from 10 years to 30 years in prison to 10 other defendants, <PERSON> Prensa </PERSON> <PERSON> Latina </PERSON> said in dispatches monitored in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. The news agency said all were convicted of collaborating with <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> cartel, the world's biggest cocaine trafficking outfit, in a scandal that reached into the highest ranks of the military and the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>. They were found guilty early Thursday by the special three-man military tribunal, <PERSON> Prensa </PERSON> <PERSON> Latina </PERSON> said. All the defendants are former military officers who were stripped of their ranks and thrown out of the Cuban <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> in June. The tribunal gave the death penalty to former Division Gen. <PERSON> Arnaldo </PERSON> <PERSON> Ochoa </PERSON>, the alleged ringleader of the smuggling ring, and to ex-Col. <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> la </PERSON> <PERSON> Guardia </PERSON>, ex-Capt <PERSON> Jorge </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> and ex-Maj. <PERSON> Armado </PERSON> <PERSON> Padron </PERSON> <PERSON> Ochoa </PERSON>, 57, fought alongside President <PERSON> Fidel </PERSON> <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> in the <LOCATION> Sierra </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Maestra </LOCATION> in the 1950s and earned the prestigious Hero of the Republic of <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> medal for his command of troops in <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION> in 1978 and in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> in 1987-1988. He was head of a group of Cuban military advisers to <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s leftist Sandinista government in 1985-1986 <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> has been identified as <PERSON> Ochoa </PERSON>'s right-hand man.

The tribunal sentenced <PERSON> Eduardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Diaz </PERSON>, <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanchez </PERSON> and <PERSON> Alexis </PERSON> <PERSON> Lago </PERSON> to 30 years in prison. The prosecutor had asked for the death penalty for them. <PERSON> Patricio </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> la </PERSON> <PERSON> Guardia </PERSON>, <PERSON> Rosa </PERSON> <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> Abierno </PERSON> and <PERSON> Miguel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruiz </PERSON> also were sentenced to 30 years in prison, five more than the prosecution had requested. <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> Abierno </PERSON> was a captain and de la Guardia was a brigadier general. The ranks of the other defendants were not known. <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> was sentenced to 10 years in prison, the agency said. The prosecution had requested a 15-year sentence for <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON>. <PERSON> Prensa </PERSON> <PERSON> Latina </PERSON> said three other defendants were given 25-year sentences.

<TEXT>
 Buoyed by the promise of billions in foreign aid, President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> leaves Saturday on a three-nation West European tour in search of financial and political support for her troubled country. Philippine officials say Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> will try to exploit her image as savior of Filipino democracy to encourage greater trade and investment to help cope with problems of poverty, communist insurgency and a $ 28 billion foreign debt. She also hopes to dispel European fears that her government has been laggard in fulfilling the pledge to protect human rights made when she was swept to power in the 1986 uprising that toppled <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' authoritarian administration. `` I would like to deliver to the people and countries of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> the message that the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> is committed to democracy, which our people restored in a very unique way, by peaceful means,'' she said in a radio broadcast this week. Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> will travel to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, then to <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> to join bicentennial celebration of the French Revolution, and finally to <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>. Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>'s trip, her second to <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> as president, follows a commitment Wednesday by industrial countries and international financial institutions to provide $ 3.5 billion in 1989 in aid for the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>. As part of the program, the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> promised to triple its aid to about $ 350 million a year. The visit represents another step in <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>'s efforts to expand trade and contacts with <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and broaden its foreign policy, which traditionally focused on its former colonial power, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. In February, the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> expressed support for Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> but added it was concerned about mounting human rights violations. Human rights groups, including <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>, accuse the military and government-backed vigilante groups of widespread torture, assassinations and illegal abductions of suspected rebels on flimsy evidence. Officials say Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> will argue her government is committed to human rights but faces a serious threat from the 23,000-member communist <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, which has been waging a 20-year war to establish a Marxist state. Ten policemen and soldiers have been slain in the <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> area in the last two weeks in attacks which the military blames on communist rebels. Opposition Sen. <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Ponce </PERSON> <PERSON> Enrile </PERSON> said Friday that Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>'s trip will reinforce the country's image as a borrower and a beggar He said Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> was leaving behind a nation in turmoil. On the eve of her departure, the government announced the arrest of a soldier in the 1988 murder of a left-wing activist and the attempted slaying of a companion in one of the country's best-known human rights cases. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investigation </ORGANIZATION> said Constable 2nd Class <PERSON> Dioscoro </PERSON> <PERSON> Ambagay </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, was arrested and warrants have been issued for two more soldiers in the slaying of leftist <PERSON> Reynaldo </PERSON> <PERSON> Francisco </PERSON> and an attempt on the life of <PERSON> Hilario </PERSON> <PERSON> Bustamante </PERSON> in March 1988.

 A man was arrested on charges of stealing two pounds of cattle gallstones valued at $ 20,000 from a meat packing company where he worked.

<TEXT>
 Killer whales have been sighted in the <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> for the first time in 40 years, according to a marine biologist who reviewed videotape shot by fishermen. `` We do n't know how they got here, but they are a migratory species,'' said <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Shipp </PERSON>, a marine science professor at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alabama </ORGANIZATION> in Mobile. `` It's possible they migrated to the warm water in the winter and got trapped here when they turned back to head north.'' <PERSON> Shipp </PERSON> said Thursday that he had been skeptical about the sighting of the whales, which have distinctive black and white coloring and are commonly found in colder waters. But he changed his mind after watching the 10-minute tape that included three minutes of what he called good footage of the whales ranging in size from about 6 feet to 20 feet long. The film was shot during a fishing tournament last weekend. Fifteen to 20 species of whale inhabit the gulf, with pilot and beach whales the most common, <PERSON> Shipp </PERSON> said. There was an unconfirmed sighting of killer whales last year near the <LOCATION> Chandeleur </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION> off the <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> coast. `` It appears that they have taken up residency and are actually surviving in the gulf,'' said <PERSON> Skip </PERSON> <PERSON> Grizzle </PERSON>, who was on the charter boat when the video was made.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> has halted refugee flights to the capital of <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> because resettlement camps are overflowing, a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said Friday. The refugees, most of them supporters of the guerrilla movement that fought for 23 years against South African rule, have stayed in the camps around <LOCATION> Windhoek </LOCATION> longer than the seven days the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> High Commissioner for Refugees had planned on. <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Eckhard </PERSON> said the refugees are reluctant to leave and go to their home villages in the north, where the <ORGANIZATION> South-West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> has most of its support, because they fear Namibian police will harass them. Refugees who have been flown into northern cities have moved out of the temporary settlement camps and those flights will continue, <PERSON> Eckhard </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> has arranged for representatives in the camps near <LOCATION> Windhoek </LOCATION> to travel to the north, see the situation and report back, with the hope that the refugees in the camps will be persuaded to leave. The <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said 16,244 of the 41,000 Namibians registered with the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> High Commissioner for Refugees have returned so far, mostly from <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> camps in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Zambia </LOCATION>. All refugees are to return by Sept. 15, the end of the registration period for voting in elections planned for November. He said two planeloads of Namibians from <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> were due to arrive on July 18 and July 24, and that small groups have returned from <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> said before the independence process began that it was caring for some 80,000 refugees with <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> aid, but there has been no explanation for the change in numbers. About 150 refugees who returned this week had been held prisoner by <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> in Angolan camps. In response to their tales of torture and allegations that <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> is holding hundreds more prisoners, <PERSON> Martti </PERSON> <PERSON> Ahtisaari </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> special representative in <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>, appealed Friday for all prisoners on both sides to be freed under terms of U.N. Resolution 435. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> has withdrawn all but 1,500 of its troops from the territory it has ruled since 1915 and has agreed to grant <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> independence. But <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Pienaar </PERSON>, the South African administrator of the territory until it becomes independent, said Wednesday he will not free about 30 <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> prisoners held by the police until a full accounting is made of all prisoners who may still be in the hands of the guerrilla movement.

<HEAD>Drunken-Driving Roadblocks Unconstitutional, Rhode Island Court Says</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Drunken-driving roadblocks violate the <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> constitution even if they are operated under guidelines the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> has implied are acceptable, the state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruled Friday. The roadblocks are an invasion of privacy under the state constitution's declaration of rights, which is stricter than the federal <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> of Rights, the high court said in a 3-2 decision. Police officials said the ruling would have little practical effect because few <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> police departments use roadblocks. But one police chief who favors them said the ruling could lead to more injuries and deaths from drunken drivers. `` How about the innocent people's rights?'' said <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Falls </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> Chief <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Choquette </PERSON>, who used the roadblocks until doubts about their constitutionality arose last summer. `` I do n't think it's giving a fair shake to the innocent person walking down the street.'' Narragansett Police Capt. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Donnell </PERSON> said his department abandoned the practice a couple of years ago because roadblocks were not cost-effective, and <LOCATION> Providence </LOCATION> Police Capt. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Devine </PERSON> agreed that his officers could catch more drunken drivers by patrolling than by setting up a fixed roadblock. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kingstown </LOCATION> Police Chief <PERSON> Vincent </PERSON> <PERSON> Vespia </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Rhode </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Island </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chiefs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, said he does not use roadblocks because he agrees with the court's reasoning. `` The concept of reasonable grounds to stop someone is n't there when you set up roadblocks to stop everybody,'' he said. The ruling voided the conviction of <PERSON> Joao </PERSON> <PERSON> Pimental </PERSON>, who was found guilty of refusing to submit to a chemical test after he was stopped by <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> police during a roadblock Oct. 10, 1986. Although the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> has not ruled on drunken-driving roadblocks, it did imply in a 1979 ruling that they would be acceptable under certain limited conditions. The justices agreed that the <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> roadblock would probably pass federal muster because police gave adequate notice, conducted it with minimal interference to the public and had limited discretion in deciding which cars to stop. However, Chief Justice <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Fay </PERSON> and two other justices said the state constitution bars roadblocks no matter how carefully they are operated. `` It is well beyond dispute that drunk drivers are a grave menace to the public and that stronger measures are needed to cope with this problem,'' <PERSON> Fay </PERSON> wrote. `` However, it would shock and offend the framers of the <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> constitution if we were to hold that the guarantees against unreasonable and warrantless searches and seizures should be subordinated to the interest of efficient law enforcement.'' Justice <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shea </PERSON>, in dissent, said the majority did not have the `` justifiable and principled rationale'' it needed to depart from previous <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> rulings. `` The minimal intrusion on the driver's privacy rights is reasonable and fully within the safeguards provided by ... the <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> constitution,'' <PERSON> Shea </PERSON> wrote.

 Three F-16 fighter jet engines worth about $ 2 million apiece have disappeared from <ORGANIZATION> Hill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION>, a spokeswoman said today. The missing engines are 17 feet long and weigh 3,500 pounds apiece.

The <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> had said Thursday that at least one engine was missing, and then confirmed this morning that three were missing.

 Zoo officials are hoping a blind date between two mateless gorillas will blossom into romance _ and a baby gorilla.

Hercules never mated with any of the gorillas he lived with at the <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION> Zoo and National Zoo. <PERSON> Zakula </PERSON> lived for 19 years with <PERSON> Sultan </PERSON>, who died of a heart attack in October.

 Conservative fundraiser <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> ` </PERSON> <PERSON> Spitz </PERSON>'' <PERSON> Channell </PERSON> was placed on two years' probation today for illegally using a tax-exempt foundation to raise donations to help arm the Nicaraguan Contras. <PERSON> Channell </PERSON> was sentenced by U.S. District Judge <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> on his guilty plea to conspiracy to defraud the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Channell </PERSON> had admitted raising $ 2 million to help arm the Contras from private donors who were told they could deduct from their income taxes money given to the tax-exempt <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Endowment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Preservation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberty </ORGANIZATION>. Weapons purchases are not a deductible purpose of a tax-exempt foundation. <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> said it was `` very difficult'' to impose a sentence `` when crimes have been committed by someone so firmly dedicated to furthering the interests of the country.'' The judge said that because of <PERSON> Channell </PERSON>'s early cooperation with Iran-Contra prosecutors he was placing him on probation. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Bromwich </PERSON>, an associate independent counsel, told <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> that <PERSON> Channell </PERSON> `` has fully lived up to the terms of his cooperation agreement.'' `` Malice never entered my decisions, my heart or my mind because I love this country,'' <PERSON> Channell </PERSON> told <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>. `` I suffer more because I have committed a crime against the country which I love so much,'' said <PERSON> Channell </PERSON>. <PERSON> Channell </PERSON>'s sentencing came a day after his former associate, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, was placed on two years' probation and ordered to perform 120 hours of community service for his inolvement in the fundraising effort. <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> did not explain why he did not order <PERSON> Channell </PERSON> to perform any community service. <PERSON> Channell </PERSON> and <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> both cooperated with independent counsel <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON>'s investigation of the Iran-Contra affair and testified as prosecution witnesses at the trial of former <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> aide <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON>. They both entered guilty pleas early in the investigation to charges of conspiring to defraud the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> by using a tax-exempt foundation to raise money for the non-deductible purpose of buying weapons for the Contras. <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> admitted helping raise $ 3.2 million to help the rebels. Both <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> and <PERSON> Channell </PERSON> could have been sentenced up to five years in prison and fined up to $ 250,000. <PERSON> Channell </PERSON> and <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said <PERSON> North </PERSON> was part of their conspiracy to use the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Endowment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Preservation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberty </ORGANIZATION> to raise money for the Contras from such private donors as <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> billionaire Nelson Bunker Hunt. At the time, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military aid to the rebels was banned by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. North was acquitted of the tax conspiracy charge by a jury that convicted him of trying to cover up the Iran-Contra affair and of illegally accepting a home security system from arms dealer <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Secord </PERSON>. On Wednesday, <PERSON> North </PERSON> was fined $ 150,000, placed on two years' probation and ordered to perform 1,200 hours of community service During Thursday's proceeding, <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> said <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> had suffered a number of adversities as a result of his guilty plea. `` I need not impose more for justice to be served,'' the judge said. <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> told <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>: `` I let my guard down.

He said helping the Contras `` was a cause that meant everything to me and in that fervor I turned a blind eye to the excesses of others and I crossed the line myself.'' Outside the courthouse, associate independent counsel <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Zornow </PERSON> said <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> `` came forward at a very early stage of the investigation to admit his wrongdoing, pleaded guilty to a very serious charge and agreed to cooperate with the government.'' `` He lived up to his agreement with the government,'' <PERSON> Zornow </PERSON> said. `` This closes the chapter on Mr. <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>.''

<HEAD>Thousands Commemorate Army Killings; Students Defy Troops</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RANGOON, Burma (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Hundreds of students shouting slogans and waving banners on Friday defied troops in the center of the capital for the first time since the military crackdown in September 1988. Leading opposition figure <PERSON> Aung </PERSON> <PERSON> San </PERSON> <PERSON> Suu </PERSON> <PERSON> Kyi </PERSON>, addressing a crowd of several thousand in the western part of the city, repeated her denunciations of the ruling military for its refusal to negotiate, a witness said. Rallies for Ms. <PERSON> Suu </PERSON> <PERSON> Kyi </PERSON> this week, including the largest since September, were held despite martial law, which forbids gatherings of more than five people. Diplomats have said the price of rice, which has doubled in the past year, and shortages have prompted more calls for democratic reform in the country the government has renamed <LOCATION> Myanmar </LOCATION>. Western diplomats said groups of up to several hundred students chanted slogans from last year's national uprising and, bearing red `` fighting peacock'' flags, dodged armed troops. Up to a thousand students gathered outside the gates of <ORGANIZATION> Rangoon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> to try to lay a wreath but were forced to turn back by armed troops, said one diplomat who spoke on condition of anonymity. Authorities arrested six student demonstrators, said government-run Radio <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION>. Residents said many stayed indoors Friday for fear of violence, and some shops in the city closed during the afternoon. But witnesses said the military appeared to be keeping a low profile and did not attempt to prevent political leaders from speaking. Ms. <PERSON> Suu </PERSON> <PERSON> Kyi </PERSON>, head of <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democracy </ORGANIZATION>, spoke during a ceremony to remember the killings of students after the 1962 military coup and those who died during army crackdowns on pro-democracy protests last year. Dozens of students were killed when the military put down a demonstration at <ORGANIZATION> Rangoon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> 26 years ago and blew up the student union building. In September, several thousand were killed in a series of crackdowns by troops. Socialist strongman Ne Win is held responsible for ordering the killings in 1962 and 1988. He officially relinquished control a year ago, but Ms. <PERSON> Suu </PERSON> <PERSON> Kyi </PERSON> repeatedly has said he is the power behind nominal head of state <PERSON> Saw </PERSON> <PERSON> Maung </PERSON>. `` Gen. Saw <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> and U Ne Win have identical views in their disregard for dialogue and civil authority,'' Ms. <PERSON> Suu </PERSON> <PERSON> Kyi </PERSON> told the crowd Friday. On Wednesday, <PERSON> Saw </PERSON> <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> insisted Ne Win retired but added: `` We are all here today because of him, he taught us like a parent.'' Ms. <PERSON> Suu </PERSON> <PERSON> Kyi </PERSON>, has drawn big crowds which have defied martial law to hear her speak in <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> in the past week. On Wednesday, more than 10,000 Burmese rallied to hear Ms. <PERSON> Suu </PERSON> <PERSON> Kyi </PERSON> speak in what Rangoon-based diplomats said was the largest political gathering since September. Diplomats said she addressed more large crowds Thursday. `` We want dialogue, not confrontation,'' she told The Associated Press Thursday. `` There is room for dialogue. It is a great pity that he -LRB- Saw <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> -RRB- appears to have rejected the idea.'' Outside the capital Friday, a bomb exploded at an oil refinery, killing two people, <ORGANIZATION> Rangoon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> reported. There was no immediate claim of responsibility.

<HEAD>Bulgaria Decrees Conscription for Emergencies as Ethnic Turks Leave</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The government has issued a decree empowering authorities to conscript civilians to work in `` emergencies'' threatening the economy, apparently to counter a massive exodus of ethnic Turks. Authorities can send civilians to work anywhere in the country under the decree. Western diplomats and journalists who have visited areas where ethnic Turks lived say many towns and villages are nearly empty and fields remain unharvested. Austrian TV showed footage this week from <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION> of fields strewn with unharvested fruit and rotting vegetables. About 100,000 ethnic Turks have fled to <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> in recent months, claiming they have been victimized by an assimilation campaign begun in 1984 which bans them from using their Turkish names, speaking Turkish or practicing Islamic rites. <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> issued the decree on June 30, but it was not published until this week, Western diplomats said. Excerpts were made available to The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> on Friday. According to the decree, men aged 18 to 60 and women 18 to 55 can be mobilized nationwide or on a regional basis. It did not say for how long. People can be called up `` to ensure the necessary manpower and equipment in emergencies or natural calamities presenting considerable difficulties to the national economy and to the country.'' Invalids, pregnant women and mothers of children under 7 are exempt. `` Those who evade civilian mobilization or without a plausible reason fail to fulfill their assignments will be fined'' up to $ 3,000, the decree said. Mobilized civilians will be paid according to undisclosed norms established by the <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministers </ORGANIZATION>, it said. Diplomats in <LOCATION> Sofia </LOCATION> said they have no information that any mobilization has begun, and the decree does not say when it takes effect. Ethnic Turks make up the main workforce in parts of eastern and southern <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION>, especially in agricultural, tobacco and food production. Turkish Premier <PERSON> Turgut </PERSON> <PERSON> Ozal </PERSON> said earlier this week that <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION> is suffering labor shortages and economic hardships as a result of the exodus. <PERSON> Mesut </PERSON> <PERSON> Yilmaz </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>'s Foreign Minister, said last week the flow would increase immensely if <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION> signs an immigration agreement with <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>. Turkish officials say as many as 300,000 ethnic Turks could arrive from <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION>. About 1 million of <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION>'s 9 million people are ethnic Turks.

 The director of <ORGANIZATION> Iran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> demanded the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> pay compensation for a jet shot down a year ago by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>, the official <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> reported Friday. <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Reza </PERSON> <PERSON> Majidi </PERSON> also demanded that <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> compensate the families of the 290 people who were killed when the A300 <ORGANIZATION> Airbus </ORGANIZATION> plunged into the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> on July 3, 1988, according to the news agency, monitored in <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Majidi </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> recently announced it was willing to pay compensation directly to relatives of the victims, <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION> said. But `` this is not acceptable to us, and the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> must pay for the downed plane in addition to the compensation,'' he said. He did not cite a dollar amount. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> has been seeking a World Court verdict against the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, and relatives of many victims are suing the designers and manufacturers of the radar system of the <ORGANIZATION> USS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Vincennes </ORGANIZATION>, the ship that shot down the plane. One of those named in the suit is <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> said the crew of the <LOCATION> Vincennes </LOCATION> mistook the jetliner for a fighter jet coming in for an attack. The cruiser had been in action against Iranian gunboats in the southern gulf earlier that day. Shortly before it was hit by missiles from the <LOCATION> Vincennes </LOCATION>, the jetliner had taken off from <PERSON> Bandar </PERSON> <PERSON> Abbas </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> for a flight to <LOCATION> Dubai </LOCATION>, in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Emirates </LOCATION>. All 290 people on board were killed. Also Friday, <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>'s mass-circulation <ORGANIZATION> Kayhan </ORGANIZATION> daily quoted <PERSON> Majidi </PERSON> as saying <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> was making efforts through the foreign ministry, the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> to make <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> return an <ORGANIZATION> Iran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> plane hijacked to <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION> in 1984. Three Iranians, opposed to the Islamic government in <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>, commandeered the <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 707 and forced the crew to fly it to a military base in southern <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, where they were offered political asylum. The 71 hostages aboard the aircraft were released, but the aircraft remained in <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>.

 Security forces armed with emergency laws arrested at least 49 suspected Sinhalese radicals as continuing civil unrest claimed 25 lives, the government said Friday. Military and police, operating under new shoot-on-sight orders, killed eight radicals in skirmishes when they made the arrests, the information department said. Ten radicals were injured, it said. Extremists of the left-wing <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> killed 12 civilians, three soldiers and a police officer since Wednesday, the statement said. No further details were given to the press, working under strict censorship laws clamped Thursday to coincide with a government crackdown on the anti-government extremists. A nationwide emergency was imposed June 20. The country's two main newspapers Friday warned that censoring the news fuels rumors. Critical editorials in <LOCATION> The </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> and The Sun newspapers were submitted to government censors. Sources at the dailies said the editorials were approved without changes. `` Tongues wag in <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION> ... censorship will be of no avail,'' said The Island. `` The danger of censorship is that all fantastic rumors tend to gain more credibility.'' The Sun said: `` What must necessarily be stressed is the futility of the exercise, as censorship often in the past turned out to be counterproductive. With the technical stoppage of news and views, the flow of rumor, gossip and electronic tele-talk takes over with no holds barred.'' Police in <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION>, meanwhile, said leading human rights activist and criminal lawyer <PERSON> Charita </PERSON> <PERSON> Lankapura </PERSON> was shot and killed Friday by two unidentified men. No details were released. Sinhalese radicals launched a campaign to topple the government two years ago to protest peace overtures being made to Tamil rebels demanding an independent nation in the northeast. The Sinhalese front says too many concessions are being made to the minority Tamils, who make up 18 percent of <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>'s 16 million people. Sinhalese make up 75 percent of the population. The front has been blamed for killing 3,500 people in two years, mostly government officials, governing party members and security force personnel. The government says the radicals instigated an ongoing strike by public transport workers that has been crippling the economy for four weeks.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> today asked <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to give some 7,200 federal executives pay increases of 8 percent to 25 percent, with even higher raises going to a selected 200 with special skills. However, the president coupled his pay-raise plan with a proposal that the officials justify their right to the higher salaries every three years to be able to keep receiving them. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s proposal would give full 25 percent hikes to just the most senior officials, matching a salary hike he has already advocated for federal judges. More junior officials would get smaller increases, at least initially, under the plan. The president also called for a phaseout of congressional peechmaking honoraria over a two-year period and said it should be linked to a pay raise for lawmakers. But he stopped short of recommending a specific level. Presidential press secretary <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> wanted <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to take the initiative on that politically touchy subject itself, but that he was ready to work with congressional leaders on a complete package. The plan would raise the pay of top federal officials, including <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> members, to $ 124,400 from the present $ 99,500. It would also raise the salary of Vice President <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> from $ 115,000 to $ 143,000. But it would not affect <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s $ 200,000 salary. The total pay package would cost taxpayers $ 101 million in the fiscal year that begins next Oct. 1; and $ 147 million in the following fiscal year, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. He said the increases would be in addition to a 3.6 percent cost-of-living increase the president is seeking for 2.2 million federal workers. The package would, for the first time, set up a special super category for federal employes with special talents, enabling them to get salaries up to the $ 124,400 top level. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said 200 individuals would qualify for these special salaries, to be determined at a later time. He suggested that nuclear scientists, physicians or others with special talents would be the type of individual considered for the special salaries. The most controversial part of the new package, however, may be the requirement that all members of the <ORGANIZATION> Senior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Executive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> undergo a re-certification process every three years to keep their higher salaries. The procedure is designed to `` assure that these people perform at a level that justifies the higher salary. We do not believe it would weaken their rights,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. He said the certification would not apply to the government's 700 high-level political appointees _ like <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> members and others appointed by the president and confirmed by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> _ because they `` can be removed at any time without appeal'' by the president. The 7,200 members of the <ORGANIZATION> Senior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Executive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> and 700 appoint executives currently make $ 68,700 to $ 80,700. Their pay is tied to the $ 89,500 that members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> get, and lawmakers' rejection of a proposed 51 percent congressional pay increase in February meant no raise for them or for judges. A private commission headed by former <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Volker </PERSON> has recommended a 25 percent increase immediately followed by a similar amount in 1991, applying to judges, executive branch officials, members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and others such as top military officers.

<HEAD>US to Forgive Debt to 16 African Countries</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s decision to forgive some African debt includes 16 nations and totals about $ 1 billion, officials said Friday. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s announcement Thursday will ease the debt burden starting Oct. 1 for <LOCATION> Benin </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cameroon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ghana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Guinea </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ivory </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Madagascar </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Malawi </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mali </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Niger </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nigeria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Senegal </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Somalia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tanzania </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Uganda </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Zaire </LOCATION>. One official estimated the face value of the loans at $ 590 million to $ 600 million. The rest would be interest already due or expected to become due over the life of the loans. An additional $ 400 million will be forgiven to seven other countries if they adopt new economic policies to put themselves into better financial shape, in cooperation with the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> and the International Monetary fund, the officials added. But they said some of the seven, such as <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION>, are not likely to adopt such programs. The others are: <LOCATION> Zimbabwe </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Liberia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Botswana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Zambia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Swaziland </LOCATION>. The officials from the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> spoke on condition that their names not be used. Though <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> has much heavier debt than <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, the burden on many <LOCATION> African </LOCATION> countries is considered heavier because their populations are much poorer and smaller. The forgiveness was announced Thursday by President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> at a news conference for non-American reporters and stems from last year's economic summit. The leaders of the seven major non-Communist governments, including <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, will meet in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> next week for a meeting. One State Department official said the other nations already have forgiven most of such debt owed to them, and so have some other creditors including the Nordic countries and the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION>. One AID official explained that many of the debts to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> go back as much as 30 years. More recently aid to the poorest countries has been given in the form of grants, as it was when major <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid programs began in the 1940s. `` Some of the grants have been going to pay interest on the old loans,'' the official added. Some debtor governments have not been paying for years, so that forgiving their debts will not have much practical effect for them. The loans to be forgiven were made for development projects and as economic aid to countries considered strategically important to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The officials said there would be no effect on loans given by the government's <ORGANIZATION> Export-Import </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> to encourage the sale of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> industrial products, by the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> to encourage the sale of farm products or by the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> for weapons and training.

 Tomatoes soon may become deadly enemies of the caterpillars that love to gnaw on them. A gene from bacteria researchers say ca n't hurt other living things will be inserted in tomato seeds, letting plants and fruit that germinate from those seeds ward off caterpillar-type insects without use of artificial pesticides. `` When the insect eats the plant, it ingests that bacterium and dies,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hulst </PERSON>, director of <ORGANIZATION> Hulst </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farm </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>, where a field trial on caterpillar-resistant tomatoes is being conducted this summer. The bacterium, Bacillus thuringiensis, is fatal only to organisms with a specific alkaline level in their systems, making it dangerous only to the caterpillar family, <PERSON> Hulst </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Hulst </PERSON> said the bacterium is nature's way of controlling the number of caterpillar-type insects. `` It's one of those antagonisms put in nature to reduce populations of certain insects,'' <PERSON> Hulst </PERSON> said during a tour of the test field. `` It is possible that without -LRB- this bacteria -RRB- in the environment, the insects might eat everything around.'' The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> agreed to the field test at <ORGANIZATION> Monsanto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> last month, but approval for general use is several years away, said <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Fuchs </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Monsanto </ORGANIZATION> researcher who directed the lab work that prepared the way for field tests. Researchers predict widespread use of this biological control because of growing concern about environmental effects from pesticides that do n't always keep insects at or below acceptable levels, <PERSON> Fuchs </PERSON> said in a telephone interview from his office in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>. He cited <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> statistics that farmers spend $ 150 million annually on chemical insecticides, yet caterpillar-type insects alone cause $ 450 million damage a year. `` There's a real need for alternatives,'' <PERSON> Fuchs </PERSON> added. `` That's what will make or break the technology for farmers _ to see a real benefit, and we're confident they will when they have a chance to look at ... insect-tolerant plants. A big advantage of the bacteria approach is `` that it has a very long history of safe and effective use in agriculture,'' said <PERSON> Trevor </PERSON> <PERSON> Suslow </PERSON>, spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> DNA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Plant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technologies </ORGANIZATION>, a pesticide laboratory that is not directly involved in the tomato research. However, he said one major concern is that widespread use of bacterial pesticides will cause insects to develop resistance more quickly. Field tests are being conducted at four locations by independent contractors to give <ORGANIZATION> Monsanto </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> researchers a broad geographic spectrum of the types of caterpillars the new tomatoes will kill. Tests began in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> two years ago and have spread to <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> to see if they will halt tomato pinworms and to <PERSON> Hughson </PERSON> 100 miles southeast of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> to determine the effect on tomato fruit worms and beet armyworms. The protein also has been tested on tobacco plants. <PERSON> Fuchs </PERSON> said taste tests will be conducted later, but he does n't think the protein will alter the flavor of the tomato <ORGANIZATION> Monsanto </ORGANIZATION>, which hopes to begin licensing the results of its gene research to seed companies by the mid-1990s, also is studying its use to control cotton bollworms and is looking into its possibilities with other vegetables. `` Any vegetables that have caterpillar insect problems could benefit from this technology,'' <PERSON> Fuchs </PERSON> said.

 Former leader <PERSON> Janos </PERSON> <PERSON> Kadar </PERSON> will be buried July 14, a day after President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> ends his visit to <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, state radio reported Friday. The funeral for <PERSON> Kadar </PERSON>, who died Thursday, comes less than one month after an elaborate reburial ceremony for <PERSON> Imre </PERSON> <PERSON> Nagy </PERSON>, the leader of the failed 1956 uprising who was executed on charges of high treason under <PERSON> Kadar </PERSON>'s leadership in 1958. <PERSON> Kadar </PERSON> will be interred at the Imre Mezoe cemetery in <LOCATION> Budapest </LOCATION>, where senior communist leaders traditionally are buried. The radio gave no other details. According to a medical report issued by <ORGANIZATION> MTI </ORGANIZATION> state news agency Friday, <PERSON> Kadar </PERSON> died of respiratory and circulatory failure after suffering increasing respiratory difficulties for 15 years. Only a few hours after <PERSON> Kadar </PERSON> died, the <ORGANIZATION> Hungarian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> declared <PERSON> Nagy </PERSON> innocent of all the charges against him. Hundreds of thousands of Hungarians turned out for <PERSON> Nagy </PERSON>'s funeral June 16 _ the 31st anniversary of his execution It was seen as the end of <PERSON> Kadar </PERSON>'s era _ a period marked by relative prosperity in the 1970s, fostered by cautions economic reforms <PERSON> Kadar </PERSON> endorsed, and ensuing stagnation as the reforms were stalled and foreign debt mounted. Many people stopped on <LOCATION> Budapest </LOCATION> streets seemed relieved at his passing. The <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> daily <ORGANIZATION> Nepszabadsag </ORGANIZATION> carried interviews Friday with the four members of the ruling <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> presidium who in a leadership reshuffle in May 1988 removed <PERSON> Kadar </PERSON> from the post he had held for 32 years and embarked on wide-ranging political and economic reforms. <PERSON> Karoly </PERSON> <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON> described <PERSON> Kadar </PERSON> as `` a man of extraordinary decency,'' and said he continued to consult the former leader daily for months after he took over from him as party general secretary last year. <PERSON> Imre </PERSON> <PERSON> Pozsgay </PERSON>, the party's leading reformer, told the newspaper that <PERSON> Kadar </PERSON> had done what he could under the circumstances, a clear reference to the orthodox <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> leadership of <PERSON> Leonid </PERSON> <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON>. `` It was the constraint of the given circumstances that unavoidably led to <PERSON> Kadar </PERSON>'s weakness showing as he continued to serve the cause of the nation,'' <PERSON> Pozsgay </PERSON> said.

 When it comes to aerobic exercise, most Americans apparently say no sweat. Also no running, walking, swimming or other strenuous activity, federal health officials have found. The <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> reported Friday that at least five of 11 physical fitness goals for 1990, which it outlined at the beginning of the decade, probably wo n't be met. `` Evidence indicates that regular physical activity reduces the incidence of ... many medical conditions,'' the <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> said in its weekly report, citing the benefits of exercise in fighting heart disease, colon cancer, diabetes and obesity. Nonetheless, the agency concluded, `` objectives for participation in regular physical activity will not be fully met.'' Here are some of the the government's 1990 `` Objectives for the Nation,'' published in 1980, and the progress _ or lack thereof _ that's been made: _ The proportion of adults ages 18-65 participating three times a week in vigorous, 20-minute exercise should exceed 60 percent Unlikely to be met; a 1984-87 survey shows that only about 8 percent of adults exercise regularly at such a level. _ Half of Americans 65 and older should walk, swim or engage in other `` appropriate'' aerobic exercise at least three times a week Not likely; a 1985 survey showed that while 46 percent of older Americans said they walked for exercise, only 8 percent met the three-times-a-week, 20-minute level. _ More than 90 percent of kids ages 10-17 should participate three times a week in 20-minute sessions of vigorous exercise Not likely; a 1984 survey found only 66 percent of children exercised at that level. _ More than 60 percent of children 10-17 should participate in daily school physical education programs Not likely; a 1984 survey placed the figure at 36 percent, only up by 3 percent from a 1974 survey. _ More than 70 percent of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> adults ought to know that cardiovascular health is best promoted by exercising at least three times a week, for 20 minutes or more, and at a level that makes heart rate and breathing `` a lot faster,'' but not so much that talking is impossible Not likely; a 1985 survey found that fewer than 40 percent got those questions right. The only goal deemed likely to be met: having more than 25 percent of large companies offer some kind of fitness program. A 1985 survey found that 32 percent of work sites with 250-749 employees, and 54 percent of those with 750 or more, offered fitness programs. One other goal may be achieved: having more than half of doctors include exercise history in their initial examinations of new patients. A 1981 check in two states, <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>, found that 47 percent of doctors routinely asked about exercise. Other goals involved more technical matters of health services and fitness evaluation techniques. `` There are a number of avenues of research attempting to get at the answers ... why exercisers exercise and why non-exercisers do n't,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Heath </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> researcher. Among the reasons being studied, he said, are ignorance of exercise's benefits, poor access to exercise opportunities and attitudes against exercise <PERSON> Heath </PERSON> noted that exercise at lower levels of intensity, while not matching the official fitness goals, can still bring fitness and health benefits. The goals for the year 2000, now in the works, may allow for people who prefer less vigorous exercise, he said.

 <LOCATION> STRASBOURG </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> _ In a landmark ruling Friday, the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> said a West German must not be extradited to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> because he could face execution if he is convicted of a double murder. <PERSON> Jens </PERSON> <PERSON> Soering </PERSON>, 22, who is jailed in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, is wanted for the stabbing deaths of a girlfriend's parents in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> in 1985. The British government agreed last year to his extradition. But the court in <LOCATION> Strasbourg </LOCATION> said if Soering is sent to <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, the prospect of execution violates his rights under the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Convention </ORGANIZATION>, whose charter bans `` inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.'' `` The applicant's extradition to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would expose him to a real risk'' of treatment banned under the European human rights charter, the court ruled. The court said if Soering were sent instead to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, which also has asked for his extradition, he would not face the death penalty and would not serve years on death row, which the court said also violates the charter. Court officials said the ruling broke new ground because it involved human rights abuses that had not yet occurred. `` Normally the court has the power to rule only on ... violations of human rights,'' said <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahoney </PERSON>, a lawyer at the court. Rulings by the rights court, a branch of the 23-nation Council of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, are not binding on the 23 council nations but are rarely ignored. Soering was arrested in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> on a check fraud charge in April 1986 after evading arrest in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, where he is charged in the March 30, 1985, slayings of <PERSON> William </PERSON> and <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Haysom </PERSON> in their home in <LOCATION> Bedford </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Haysom </PERSON>, his girlfriend at the time, is serving a 90-year sentence for her part in the killings The court did not address Soering's guilt in the deaths of the parents, opposed Soering's relationship with their daughter. <PERSON> Mahoney </PERSON> said <PERSON> Soering </PERSON> has admitted to participating in the killings but has given differing accounts of the circumstances. Sending Soering to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> `` would not involve suffering of such exceptional intensity or duration,'' said <PERSON> Rolv </PERSON> <PERSON> Ryssdal </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION>, the court's president. The ruling noted inmates spend between six and eight years on <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>'s death row as their cases go through a lengthy review process. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> abolished the death penalty in 1949. If convicted in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, Soering faces a maximum prison sentence of 10 to 15 years. <PERSON> Ryssdal </PERSON> said the court's ruling against extradition also took into account Soering's state of mind and that he was 18 at the time of the killings. Psychiatrists have said he `` had lost his personal identity in a symbiotic relationship with his girlfriend _ a powerful, persuasive and disturbed young woman.'' The court ordered the British government to pay Soering's legal costs of about $ 42,720. It dismissed minor claims by Soering, including the allegation he did not get a fair hearing in British courts that considered the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> extradition request.

 Former Gen. <PERSON> Arnaldo </PERSON> <PERSON> Ochoa </PERSON>, who fought alongside <PERSON> Fidel </PERSON> <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> and became one of <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>'s best-known war heroes, was sentenced to death by firing squad Friday for helping smuggle tons of cocaine into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, the official Cuban news agency said. Three other former officers also were condemned by a court-martial, which handed out prison sentences ranging from 10 years to 30 years to 10 other defendants, <PERSON> Prensa </PERSON> <PERSON> Latina </PERSON> said in dispatches monitored in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Castro </PERSON>'s regime launched an unprecedented and highly publicized investigation into <PERSON> Ochoa </PERSON> aimed at erasing a stain on the nation and the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Ochoa </PERSON>'s actions constituted an attack on `` the credibility of President <PERSON> Fidel </PERSON> <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> and weakened the prestige and defense of the Cuban revolution,'' prosecutor Brig. Gen. <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Escalona </PERSON> said in his summation Wednesday. For years, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> had been accusing <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> of allowing drug traffickers to operate, an accusation <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> indignantly dismissed as a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> plot to discredit <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>. But, embarrassingly, the accusations turned out to be true. A military hearing and the separate court-martial revealed details of an operation that used <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> as a way station for smuggling cocaine from <LOCATION> Colomba </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> cartel into southern <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. The court-martial, made up of three senior generals, sentenced <PERSON> Ochoa </PERSON>, ex-Col. Antonio de la Guardia Font, ex-Maj. <PERSON> Armado </PERSON> <PERSON> Padron </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jorge </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> to death. All were stripped of their rank and expelled from the party last week after the hearing before a 47-officer court of honor. The prosecutor had asked for the death penalty for three other officers, <PERSON> Eduardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Diaz </PERSON>, <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanchez </PERSON> and <PERSON> Alexis </PERSON> <PERSON> Lago </PERSON>, but the tribunal sentenced them to 30 years in prison. <PERSON> Prensa </PERSON> <PERSON> Latina </PERSON>, hailing the verdicts as a `` reflection of the exercise of democracy and legality in <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>,'' said appeals to <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>'s supreme military court and the council of state were being expedited It said the defendants had admitted guilt but were asking for mercy based on their records and contrition. The fall of <PERSON> Ochoa </PERSON> was most impressive because of his background and standing. He fought alongside <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> in the <LOCATION> Sierra </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Maestra </LOCATION> in the 1950s, battling and eventually defeating the forces of dictator <PERSON> Fulgencio </PERSON> <PERSON> Batista </PERSON>. <PERSON> Ochoa </PERSON> earned the prestigious Hero of the Republic of <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> medal for his command of troops in <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION> in 1978 and in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> in 1987-1988. He also headed <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>'s military advisory mission to <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s leftist Sandinista government in 1985-86. Prosecutor <PERSON> Escalona </PERSON> told the court that <PERSON> Ochoa </PERSON> robbed the Nicaraguans `` of big sums of money,'' betrayed the Angolans with black market deals, and planned `` to build a mansion with fine woods from the Angolan jungles.'' `` He profited from the hunger of the Angolan people with the flour, salt and fish that hungry Angolan stomachs clamored for and thousands of children died, simply because they lacked these items,'' <PERSON> Escalona </PERSON> said in his summation. The smuggling ring apparently was centered in an <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> unit headed by <ORGANIZATION> de </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> la </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guardia </ORGANIZATION> and dedicated to circumventing the 1963 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade embargo on <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>. In addition to drugs, the officers were convicted of smuggling diamonds, ivory, sugar, manufactured goods and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollars. Confessions and testimony showed the ring worked with the <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> cartel for at least 2 -LCB- years and allowed tons of cocaine from <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> and shiploads of Jamaican marijuana to pass through Cuban waters and airspace into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Prensa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Latina </ORGANIZATION> said $ 1.2 million and 423,000 pesos in cash were seized along with 39 expensive automobiles, a motorcycle and 186 firearms. <PERSON> Ochoa </PERSON> also had a secret bank account in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, it said. Defense Minister <PERSON> Raul </PERSON> <PERSON> Castro </PERSON>, <PERSON> Fidel </PERSON>'s brother, told the court <PERSON> Ochoa </PERSON> had been `` spreading around gifts and handing out objects of value, mainly to officers, ... in a delirious excercise of self-indulgence, of the creation of an image and links of gratitude to his person.'' That seemed to imply that <PERSON> Ochoa </PERSON> was building his own power base, perhaps to challenge or gain a measure of independence from the <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> brothers. <PERSON> Rosa </PERSON> <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> Abierno </PERSON>, <PERSON> Miguel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruiz </PERSON> and <PERSON> Patricio </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> la </PERSON> <PERSON> Guardia </PERSON>, <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON>'s twin brother, also were sentenced to 30 years in prison, five more than the prosecution had requested, <PERSON> Prensa </PERSON> <PERSON> Latina </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> Abierno </PERSON> was a captain and de la Guardia was a brigadier general. The ranks of the other defendants were not known. The prosecution had requested a 15-year sentence for <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON>, but the tribunal reduced that to 10 years because there was no evidence he took part in the drug smuggling, the agency said. <PERSON> Prensa </PERSON> <PERSON> Latina </PERSON> said three other defendants were given 25-year sentences. In earlier dispatches, it had identified them as <PERSON> Leonel </PERSON> <PERSON> Estevez </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Pineda </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gabriel </PERSON> <PERSON> Prendes </PERSON>. Gen. <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Abrantes </PERSON> <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON> was sacked as Interior Minister for failing to detect the smuggling ring in his department. The court-martial and military hearing included publicity about the participants' own guilty feelings for betraying the revolution. Defendants were shown on Cuban TV with heads bowed as they were denounced as traitors. <PERSON> Ochoa </PERSON> was shown saying he deserved to die.

 Syrian troops shelled the Christian coast Friday, and the head of a Moslem militia said he wants missiles to counter those reportedly acquired by <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> forces and `` aimed at my house.'' Also Friday, scattered clashes between rival Moslem militias left two people dead and four wounded, police said. The shelling _ a daily effort to keep ships from supplying the Christian enclave _ killed three people and wounded seven, police said. The casualties from the shelling raised the overall toll to 405 people killed and 1,558 wounded since March 8, when the fighting started between the Christian forces loyal to the government led by Gen. <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> and Syrian troops backing a rival Moslem Cabinet. <PERSON> Nabih </PERSON> <PERSON> Berri </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Moslem </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Amal </ORGANIZATION> militia, said in the Syrian capital, <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION>, that he wants to match a shipload of Soviet-designed Frog-7 missiles as well as T-54 and T-55 tanks he said the Christians received Thursday from <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. `` They're not to threaten <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> or any other country,'' he said. `` They're to be used against the Lebanese and the parties of the national coalition,'' an alliance of six Moslem parties. His vow threatened to escalate the conflict that the <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> has been trying to halt. Amal had stayed out of the fighting over the past 16 weeks. Christian sources reported in April that <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> _ <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>'s main Arab foe _ delivered six Frog-7s to the Lebanese Forces, the Christians' main militia <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>, which maintains 40,000 troops in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, demanded that the missiles shipped in April be removed because they can hit <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION>, 40 miles from Christian positions in mountains northeast of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> has linked the issue to lifting the naval blockade. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> has not confirmed that his 20,000 mainly Christian troops possess Frog-7s and his aides have been vague in answering questions about the missiles. <PERSON> Berri </PERSON> made his comments after meeting with Druse Moslem chieftain <PERSON> Walid </PERSON> <PERSON> Jumblatt </PERSON>, who heads the <ORGANIZATION> Progressive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> party militia. <PERSON> Berri </PERSON> said he had told Syrian officials that the Christians' missiles were `` aimed at my house, the house of <PERSON> Walid </PERSON> <PERSON> Jumblatt </PERSON> and at the Syrian headquarters'' in Moslem west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> `` The Syrians must help us. We are their allies. If they can not, or will not, then it is our right to seek to purchase such advanced weapons from any source,'' <PERSON> Berri </PERSON> said. He said no official request has been made to the Syrians, but that he was waiting for President <PERSON> Hafez </PERSON> <PERSON> Assad </PERSON> to return from his summer residence in the coastal city of <LOCATION> Latakia </LOCATION> to make the request. Pro-Iranian militiamen of <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>, or Party of God, and fighters of the Syrian-backed <ORGANIZATION> Amal </ORGANIZATION>, the mainstream Shiite Moslem militia, fought scattered gunbattles in south <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>'s seaside <LOCATION> Ouzai </LOCATION> district Friday. Police reported two people killed and four wounded. Police said the fighting broke out after <ORGANIZATION> Amal </ORGANIZATION> militiamen tried to sell their weekly magazine in <LOCATION> Ouzai </LOCATION>, a <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> stronghold. Syrian soldiers `` are trying to separate the combatants,'' said a police spokesman, who can not be named in line with standing rules. The two groups, vying for dominance of the 1.2 million Shiites who make up <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s largest single sect, battled for two days in Moslem west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> early this week. Three people were killed and 11 wounded, by police count. In another development, a source at <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s headquarters said <LOCATION> Syrian </LOCATION> intelligence agents captured 32 <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> civilians and 10 of <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s soldiers in Moslem sectors of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> on Thursday. The source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the soldiers were released Friday. `` Efforts are under way to obtain the release of the civilians,'' he said.

 The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration today slapped a permanent import ban on 43 types of assault-style firearms whose shipment into the country has been suspended since spring. <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alcohol </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tobacco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Firearms </ORGANIZATION>, said the government had studied 50 styles of semiautomatic weapons imported in the country and had decided to ban all but seven of them permanently. The bureau has been studying the use of the suspended weapons to determine if they fit the requirement that they be used for sporting purposes. The Gun Control Act of 1968 bans the importation of weapons that are not used for legitimate sporting purposes. `` The study was undertaken because of the dramatic increase in the number of these weapons being imported and police reports of their use in violent crime,'' <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> said. As a result of the study, 43 of the weapons were classified officially as semiautomatic assault rifles and as such were barred from further importation. <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> said in April that the weapons under study were `` basically paramilitary in appearance, they are large-capacity magazines.'' Of the seven models exempted from the import ban, six are .22 rimfire caliber rifles and the other a gun called the <ORGANIZATION> Valmet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hunter </ORGANIZATION>, which had been considered an AK-47 type of weapon during the suspension. The seven models may be imported again, <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> said. The ban will affect about 750,000 weapons that importers wanted to bring into the country, he said. The suspension had covered new import permits as well as those weapons for which permits already had been granted and which were en route to this country. <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> estimated that the <ORGANIZATION> Customs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> has seized about 20,000 of the weapons and that those will not be allowed into the country unless purchased by law enforcement agencies. Asked at a news conference whether the government will pay damages to importers, he said, `` That's something the court would decide.'' Three importers already have brought suit against the government over the suspension. Although a federal court has upheld the government in one of the cases, <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> ATF </ORGANIZATION> would accept comments on the permanent ban from any importers for 30 days. The final regulations would be issued `` very quickly'' after that, he said. The bureau, which has the power to control imports, does not regulate domestic manufacture of weapons, so similar weapons made in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would not be affected by the action. Several bills pending in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> would control or eliminate many of the U.S.-made assault-style weapons. <ORGANIZATION> ATF </ORGANIZATION> has estimated that domestic makes account for three-quarters of the 3 million semiautomatic rifles now owned by Americans. <ORGANIZATION> Colt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION> suspended sales of its AR-15, the most popular of the domestic assault-style semiautomatic rifles, in March. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, a hunter and a lifetime member of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rifle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> which opposes limits on weapons, came into office opposing any bans on the assault-style weapons. A public outcry over the availability of the weapons was triggered in January, when a man opened fire with an AK-47 and other weapons on a schoolyard in <LOCATION> Stockton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, killing five children. The man, <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Purdy </PERSON>, later killed himself. Semiautomatic versions of assault weapons such as the AK-47 and the Uzi carbine have become popular with drug gangs, and their use in illegal activities has skyrocketed in the past year, according to law enforcement officials. The <PERSON> Uzi </PERSON> carbine has been imported since the late 1970s. A study by The Atlanta Journal-Constitution found that an assault-style gun is 20 times more likely to be used in crime than a conventional firearm. <PERSON> Sarah </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>, chairwoman of <ORGANIZATION> Handgun </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, today praised the <ORGANIZATION> ATF </ORGANIZATION>'s action, saying it `` confirms what was long known: that these imported assault weapons do not serve a legitimate sporting purpose. `` I commend President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> for his leadership in working toward reducing assault weapon violence by stopping the import of these weapons of war,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>, whose husband, former White House press secretary <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>, was severely wounded in the 1981 assassination attempt on President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. `` ... It is no more acceptable to have citizens being gunned down by killing machines wearing a `` Made in the <LOCATION> USA </LOCATION>'' label than by those made abroad.'' The <ORGANIZATION> NRA </ORGANIZATION> declined to comment on the action until it was formally announced, but <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Snyder </PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Citizens </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> for the Right to Keep and Bear Arms, denounced it in advance. `` I think that it shows that the undependability of government, because originally, the <ORGANIZATION> ATF </ORGANIZATION> had certified that these rifles could be imported because they are suitable for sporting purposes,'' <PERSON> Snyder </PERSON> said. `` I think it also tends to further undermine whatever credibility President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has left with the firearms-owning community in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.'' The <ORGANIZATION> NRA </ORGANIZATION> has opposed limits on the rights of law-abiding citizens to own the weapons, saying the solution to any problem is to lock up criminals. <ORGANIZATION> NRA </ORGANIZATION> members noted that <PERSON> Purdy </PERSON> had been convicted of numerous offenses but spent relatively little time in custody and was able to evade regulations in order to buy the guns he used in his murderous attack on the school yard. The <ORGANIZATION> NRA </ORGANIZATION> has argued that the inner workings of the weapons in question are identical to those of weapons that have been around for decades, and that limits on them could adversely affect those who own semiautomatic hunting rifles. The study to determine how the imported weapons were being used began in March when <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>, who oversees the <ORGANIZATION> ATF </ORGANIZATION>, imposed a suspension on imports of five categories of the weapons, including the semiautomatic version of the AK-47 and Uzi carbines. <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> took the action at the urging of <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>, the director of national drug control policy, who had been told by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to determine what should be done about the weapons. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> widened the suspension on imports a month later to include two dozen additional styles of guns. At the same time, he called for a limit on magazine size to 15 shots. Legislation introduced by Sen. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Metzenbaum </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ohio </LOCATION>, called for a magazine limit of 20 shots. The weapons on the original suspension list come primarily from <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>. Others are made in <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>, among other countries.

<TEXT>
 A senior <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official joined <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> colleagues Friday to monitor the progress of U.S.-brokered peace accords on <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, as doubts clouded the future of talks to end <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>'s civil war. <PERSON> Herman </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON>, assistant secretary of state for <LOCATION> African </LOCATION> affairs, is expected to meet separately with Angolan officials to discuss bilateral relations and a cease-fire agreed to June 22 by President <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Eduardo </PERSON> <PERSON> dos </PERSON> <PERSON> Santos </PERSON> and Angolan rebel leader <PERSON> Jonas </PERSON> <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON>. Both <PERSON> dos </PERSON> <PERSON> Santos </PERSON> and <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON> have denounced violations of the truce that was to silence guns in this southern African nation on June 24. Both indicate they want peace talks to go forward, but <PERSON> dos </PERSON> <PERSON> Santos </PERSON> is believed to be having trouble selling the pact to Marxist hard-liners in his government. A sign of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> support would strengthen <PERSON> dos </PERSON> <PERSON> Santos </PERSON>' position, diplomats say. <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON>'s deputy, <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON>, would only say on arrival Friday: `` It's inevitable we'll discuss bilateral relations with the Angolans.'' <PERSON> Dos </PERSON> <PERSON> Santos </PERSON> has donned the cloak of pragmatism, tempering Marxism in return for Western aid to rebuild a war-shattered economy bolstered by earnings of an Angolan-U.S. oil consortium and Soviet aid. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pretoria </LOCATION> have backed <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> for the Total Independence of <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> since Portuguese colonizers abandoned the country to the warring factions in 1975. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> has no diplomatic relations with <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> and currently gives the guerrillas $ 15 million a year in military aid. In accords signed in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> on Dec. 22, <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> agreed to the withdrawal of 50,000 Cuban troops from <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> in return for <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s granting independence to <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> and halting aid to <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, which has backed <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> since 1975, are observing a meeting of the commission monitoring the accords. Opening the commission's fourth two-day session Friday, Angolan Foreign Minister <PERSON> Pedro </PERSON> <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> <PERSON> van </PERSON> <PERSON> Dunem </PERSON> said members can `` congratulate ourselves, particularly because of the political will demonstrated by all parties who have really backed the possibility of peace in our region.'' Col. <PERSON> Arvid </PERSON> <PERSON> Geirulv </PERSON>, deputy commander of the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Angolan Verifying Mission, said 13,360 Cuban troops left <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> between Jan. 10 and Wednesday, keeping the withdrawal on schedule. Cuban troops remaining in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> are to withdraw north of the 15th parallel by Aug. 1 and be out of the country by mid-1991. `` I believe the meeting will be calm and productive and that we'll be able to find solutions to pending problems,'' said <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> van </PERSON> <PERSON> Heerden </PERSON>, secretary-general of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>. Cuban Deputy Foreign Minister <PERSON> Ricardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Alarcon </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Quesada </PERSON> is heading his country's delegation and Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister <PERSON> Anatoli </PERSON> <PERSON> Adamishin </PERSON> was expected in <LOCATION> Luanda </LOCATION> later Friday. Observers say the commission's problems are manageable, concerning isolated cross-border incidents and the return of Namibian refugees from <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Zambia </LOCATION>. Not so clearcut is the future of peace talks <PERSON> dos </PERSON> <PERSON> Santos </PERSON> broke off last week in <LOCATION> Zaire </LOCATION>, saying they could not continue `` in a climate of war.'' <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>'s official news agency reported Friday that <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON>'s guerrillas killed six people in attacks on civilian vehicles in southwestern <LOCATION> Benguela </LOCATION> province It said this brought the toll to 20 people killed by the guerrillas since the cease-fire took effect. <PERSON> Dos </PERSON> <PERSON> Santos </PERSON> has described the June 22 summit of African leaders in <LOCATION> Gbadolite </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Zaire </LOCATION>, as `` hurried,'' and it now appears several people, including <LOCATION> Zambian </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaunda </PERSON>, jumped the gun in reporting <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON> had agreed to go into temporary exile _ an Angolan government pre-condition for negotiations. <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON>, who operates from <PERSON> bush </PERSON> headquarters in southeastern <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>, says he has no intention of going into exile.

<TEXT>
 Convicted heroin trafficker and reputed mobster <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> Gotti </PERSON> was sentenced Friday to the maximum 50 years in prison by a judge who condemned his long involvement in `` gangland-type activities and lawlessness.'' <PERSON> Gotti </PERSON>, younger brother of <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Gotti </PERSON>, the man law enforcers call the head of the Gambino crime family and one of the nation's most powerful criminals, showed no reaction as <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bartels </PERSON> sentenced him. Co-defendant <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Carneglia </PERSON> also was sentenced to 50 years, and both men were fined $ 75,000. They were convicted May 23 of running a multimillion-dollar heroin ring. `` These are very serious crimes,'' said <PERSON> Bartels </PERSON>. `` The government has proved these defendants are members of the Gambino crime family and that their allegiance is placed above the laws of this country.'' Defense lawyers said they were shocked by the severity of the sentence, but confident the conviction would be overturned on appeal. <PERSON> Gotti </PERSON> and <PERSON> Carneglia </PERSON> will remain at the <ORGANIZATION> Metropolitan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Correctional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> at least until fall, pending the outcome of their appeals. <PERSON> Gotti </PERSON>, 42, of <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Stream </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Carneglia </PERSON>, 44, of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, would likely spend 25 years in jail before becoming eligible for parole, said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Maloney </PERSON>. Authorities describe <PERSON> Gotti </PERSON> as a Gambino capo, or captain, and <PERSON> Carneglia </PERSON> as a soldier in the family reputedly involved in loansharking, extortion, labor rackets, gambling and drug dealing. Defense attorneys <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Shargel </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Fischetti </PERSON> argued for lighter sentences, saying their clients have wives and children and have been convicted of no crimes since their arrest on the drug charges in August 1983. <PERSON> Gotti </PERSON> and <PERSON> Carneglia </PERSON> have been jailed since June 29, the day after <PERSON> Bartels </PERSON> revoked bail because he found they had continued to deal drugs and associate with other mobsters after their conviction. At the bail hearing, an <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agent testified that <PERSON> Gotti </PERSON> helped his brother <PERSON> John </PERSON> plan the assassination of the former Gambino boss, <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Castellano </PERSON>, to escape a possible mob death sentence for dealing heroin. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Gotti </PERSON> took command of the <PERSON> Gambino </PERSON> family after <PERSON> Castellano </PERSON> and his bodyguard were shot Dec. 16, 1985, outside a restaurant, law-enforcement officials say. Under <PERSON> Castellano </PERSON>'s rules for his crime family, trafficking in heroin was punishable by death, the agent testified. <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> Gotti </PERSON> and <PERSON> Carneglia </PERSON> had remained free on $ 1 million bail each while the case made its way through the courts. The case resulted in two mistrials and became one of the oldest cases on the federal docket.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s program to inoculate prison inmates against German measles involves a choice: be vaccinated or isolated. Prison system spokesman <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Flateau </PERSON>, who has characterized the program as `` voluntary'' for the past several days, said Friday that 12 inmates at Downstate prison have refused vaccinations and have been kept in isolation `` for about a week.'' He said the dozen inmates would probably remain isolated several more days until doctors are sure they are n't going to get measles. <PERSON> Flateau </PERSON> continued to describe the rubella inoculation program, stemming from a German measles outbreak in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Rikers </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> jail complex, as voluntary. `` It is voluntary,'' he said. `` There's a medical problem out there and you've got to address the medical problem. One way of addressing the medical problem is to receive the inoculation; the other way of addressing it is for us to be sure, if you're not inoculated, that you have n't been exposed.'' <PERSON> Flateau </PERSON> said the resulting quarantines were `` for medical purposes, not punitive.'' The prison system spokesman said that about 20 guards have also refused to be vaccinated. He said they are being `` counseled'' and that if they continue to refuse vaccinations they will be required to sign a waiver indicating they have been informed of the risk they face. Having signed the waiver, they will be allowed to continue to work `` because they really only present a danger to each other,'' said <PERSON> Flateau </PERSON>. The rest of the staff and all the inmates, except those who accepted isolation, will have been vaccinated. Medical isolation, according to <PERSON> Flateau </PERSON>, means prisoners are confined to quarters and ca n't participate in group activities. Meals are brought to the prisoner. <PERSON> Flateau </PERSON> said that about 5,000 inmates and prison staff have thus far been inoculated at five prisons that health officials think might be at risk because they had accepted prisoners recently from the <LOCATION> Rikers </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> complex. In all, about 7,000 doses of vaccine, costing the state $ 16 per dose, have been sent to the prisons, said <PERSON> Flateau </PERSON>. The state has refused to accept inmates from the two affected sections of <LOCATION> Rikers </LOCATION> since June 29. He said the state will begin taking prisoners again from those sections over the next few weeks.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> brushed aside the sight of fancy cars and expensive shops and savored what he found most precious in this affluent city. The retired coal miner took a deep breath. `` The air is so clean.'' `` If you stood in my town, after a while you'd look like you were working in a coal mine,'' said <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>, from <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION> `` The coal dust really flies,'' agreed his wife, <PERSON> Mavis </PERSON>. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>, 54, has a keen appreciation for clean air. He suffers from black lung disease, a debilitating ailment that forced him to retire from the mines nine years ago. He was in <LOCATION> Greenwich </LOCATION> on Friday with his wife, his wife's sister and his brother-in-law to picket one last day outside the corporate headquarters of the strike-bound <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> before heading home. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>'s benefits have been wiped out and his brother-in-law is out of work as a result of the strike by about 1,700 coal miners in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> that began in April. As part of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION>' strike strategy, the union has been bringing up groups of a dozen or so miners and their families to picket outside <LOCATION> Pittson </LOCATION> headquarters. Although violence has erupted elsewhere, the <LOCATION> Greenwich </LOCATION> picket lines have been peaceful. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> and his family were part of a group of 13 visiting <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>. On the way north, they participated in rallies held by labor unions in <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J </LOCATION>. The group was divided in three teams upon arrival in <LOCATION> Greenwich </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> and his family formed one team, and they worked three-hour shifts on the picket line daily this past week. `` I would like to live here, if I could afford it. It's a clean town, a nice town,'' said <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>'s brother-in-law, <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Blakenship </PERSON>, from <PERSON> Rowe </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION> `` But I like my job. We like the family ties we have down there.'' `` We know everybody by name,'' added his wife, <PERSON> Marie </PERSON>. They said <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Rowe </PERSON> have about 10,000 residents each. <LOCATION> Greenwich </LOCATION>, with 60,000 residents, is one of the nation's wealthiest communities and home to many celebrities and top business executives who commute to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. Mrs. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> and Mrs. <PERSON> Blakenship </PERSON> said they were impressed by the beautiful homes and the variety of shops, although the prices were dismaying. The average sale price of a home in <LOCATION> Greenwich </LOCATION> last year was $ 800,000, while Mrs. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> said her home _ `` one of the nicest homes in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'' _ is on the market for $ 135,000. Mrs. <PERSON> Blakenship </PERSON> said everyone in <LOCATION> Greenwich </LOCATION> drives a nice car, while back home pickups and huge coal-hauling trucks predominate. Despite the differences, the four said they found <LOCATION> Greenwich </LOCATION> residents to be friendly. They said motorists blew their horns and gestured support. The foursome's only hostile words were for <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> officials, who've declined to meet with strikers. No new contract talks are being held and replacement workers hve been trying to mine the coal. `` They think we're a bunch of dumb hillbillies, but we're not,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Blakenship </PERSON>.

 Angry Israeli mourners demanded vengeance and a harsh crackdown on the <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> uprising at funerals Friday for those killed when a bus was forced into a ravine by an Arab assailant. Police used tear gas to break up a crowd of stone-throwing Israelis in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> protesting the attack that killed 14 people Thursday. At another rally in the capital, officers on horseback dispersed about 200 people chanting `` Kill the Arabs!'' A policeman was slightly injured in one clash. A Palestinian from the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> was seriously injured in an apparent revenge attack when his car was stoned as he passed a Jewish settlement in southern <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. Hospital officials said he was unconscious and suffering brain damage. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio reported at least three other stoning attacks on Arab cars across the country. Arab sources said three Palestinians were hurt in the attacks. In <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, militants chased Finance Minister <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON> <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> from a funeral by shaking their fists, banging on his car and screaming, `` Go home, maniac!'' <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> heads the left-leaning <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, which calls for giving up occupied land in exchange for peace. At another funeral, Cabinet Minister <PERSON> Avner </PERSON> <PERSON> Shaki </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Religious </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, vowed to seek `` new stubborn, non-routine and harsh ways to end this filthy Arab terrorism.'' An <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> judge, meanwhile, ordered an Arab man from the occupied <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> held an additional 15 days on suspicion of staging the attack on a bus on the <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv-Jerusalem </LOCATION> highway. He was injured in the crash and arrested immediately afterward. Two of those killed were Canadian tourists _ the first foreign victims of the uprising _ and at least 10 were Israelis. Eight of the 27 injured were Americans. It was the worst attack on Israelis during the 18-month uprising, which has claimed the lives of 546 Arabs and 33 Israelis. The Moslem fundamentalist group <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jihad </ORGANIZATION> claimed responsibility for the attack in a communique issued in <LOCATION> Amman </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>. `` One of our mujaheddin -LRB- freedom fighters -RRB- carried out an operation and there will be other operations ... All aggressive Jews should quickly leave the holy land or they will confront their fate,'' it said. Police would not release the suspect's name or give details of the investigation. A senior police official identified the suspect as a 28-year-old man from a refugee camp in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> and referred to the incident as a `` terrorist suicide attack for nationalist reasons.'' Police were investigating whether the suspect acted on his own or on orders from a guerrilla group, officials said, adding that a second suspect also had been questioned in the case. <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> police spokesman <PERSON> Uzi </PERSON> <PERSON> Sandori </PERSON> said both the driver and passengers told police the suspect grabbed the steering wheel of the bus, shouting in Arabic: `` God is great.'' Israeli newspapers said the Palestinian told investigators he acted in revenge against beatings of relatives by <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers. The reports also said the suspect carefully planned the attack, riding on the bus route several times to choose the deadliest location. Three of the bus victims were buried Friday. <PERSON> Shaki </PERSON>, a minister without portfolio, spoke at the burial of lawyer <PERSON> Mordechai </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosenberg </PERSON>, 50, in Holon, near <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION>. He said outside the cemetery that he would press for a crackdown on the uprising and added: `` It is not possible that they will kill us and spill our blood almost every week.'' The most tumultuous funeral was that of <PERSON> Miriam </PERSON> <PERSON> Tzarafi </PERSON>, a 40-year-old secretary and mother of three. Several dozen mourners descended on <PERSON> Peres </PERSON>, who was swiftly ushered by secret service guards back to his car before the funeral began. Many of the 200 mourners at the <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Shaul </LOCATION> cemetery wept loudly. Relatives poured cold water on her 17-year-old daughter, <PERSON> Orit </PERSON>, to keep her from fainting, Two men propped up her husband, <PERSON> Aziz </PERSON>, as a rabbi recited the Jewish burial prayer, or Kaddish, which is Hebrew for sanctification. `` Mommy, you loved me. I want to see my mommy,'' screamed Mrs. <PERSON> Tzarafi </PERSON>'s 5-year-old son, <PERSON> Orit </PERSON>, who was kept away from the funeral. `` It's hard to part from you <PERSON> Miriam </PERSON>. I wish they had taken me instead,'' said her elderly father-in-law, <PERSON> Zion </PERSON> <PERSON> Tzarafi </PERSON>, a retired postal worker. Several mourners said after the funeral they hoped the government would take harsher measures against Arabs. `` We have to make sure that no Arab is allowed to travel freely in our country without special passes,'' said a cousin, <PERSON> Shmuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Turkiya </PERSON>, 55.

 Leftist guerrillas who kidnapped a Norwegian anthropologist last year said Friday they will kill him because he exploited Indians. The rebel communique, released to newspapers and radio stations in the capital, said the decision to kill <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Olson </PERSON> was taken after rebels talked with settlers, peasants and others living in the <LOCATION> Catatumbo </LOCATION> area near the Venezuelan border. It did not say when he would be killed. <PERSON> Olsen </PERSON>, who has lived in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> for 29 years, had been working with Indians in the <LOCATION> Catatumbo </LOCATION> area. He was kidnapped in October 1988 by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, a group that has attacked foreign companies, especially oil interests. The president of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Indian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Leaders </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Anatolio </PERSON> <PERSON> Quira </PERSON>, urged that <PERSON> Olson </PERSON> be released.

The labor organization has been the backbone of the <ORGANIZATION> Peronist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> for four decades and held 13 general strikes during the five-year term of President <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON>, whom <PERSON> Menem </PERSON> replaces. <PERSON> Menem </PERSON> said publicly that <PERSON> Ubaldini </PERSON> wanted to leave the labor federation and had been offered a diplomatic post abroad. <PERSON> Ubaldini </PERSON> denied it and refused the job. `` He tried to get rid of <PERSON> Ubaldini </PERSON>; that's very interesting,'' <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> Esquivel </PERSON> said. `` He is trying to increase his room to maneuver and part of that means getting rid of people who might be political opponents.'' The new president, elected May 14, faces economic problems that are immediate and enormous. Inflation in June alone exceeded 100 percent, unemployment is about 10 percent, the currency has lost 97 percent of its value since February and the deficit has grown to an estimated 12 percent of the $ 80 billion gross national product. Arrears of $ 4.5 billion in payments on the $ 60 billion foreign debt make it impossible to obtain new loans. The central bank holds about $ 1 billion worth of gold, but virtually no foreign currency. Real wages have shrunk by at least 40 percent since January. Shantytowns and malnutrition are spreading. Supermarkets in <LOCATION> Cordoba </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Mendoza </PERSON> and <PERSON> Rosario </PERSON> cities were looted this week in a minor replay of the food riots six weeks ago. `` We're starting from nothing,'' <PERSON> Menem </PERSON> said in an interview published Sunday in <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cronista </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Comercial </ORGANIZATION>, a financial daily. `` We're going to do major surgery,'' he declared in reference to the telephone, railway, oil and other state companies that lose money and siphon off funds from the budget. Leaders of <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Paraguay </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> arrived Friday for the ceremony. <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Julio </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanguinetti </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Uruguay </LOCATION> were expected later. Former Secretary of State <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Kissinger </PERSON> arrived as a special guest of <PERSON> Menem </PERSON>. The leader of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> delegation, <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Mosbacher </PERSON>, arrived Thursday. <PERSON> Menem </PERSON>'s economic plan centers on making state companies private to attract foreign capital, voluntary price controls to curb inflation, low-interest business loans to maintain production and jobs, incentives for farm production and exports, and wage raises to increase consumer demand. To reduce the deficit, <PERSON> Menem </PERSON> plans to cut subsidies, enforce tax laws and raise utility rates. Unions oppose the sale of state companies for fear of mass layoffs, businessmen oppose price controls and wage increases, and workers are against higher utility rates. With his conservative appointments and policies, <PERSON> Menem </PERSON> is turning away from the <ORGANIZATION> Peronist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> rank and file who elected him. <PERSON> Mora </PERSON> y <PERSON> Araujo </PERSON> said: `` He wants to do something that has n't been done in <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> since the 1930s: govern to the political right, but with popular support.'' <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON>, whose <ORGANIZATION> Radical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> party lost the May 14 election, tried many of the same measures and was blocked. He also faced three rebellions by soldiers pressing the view that trials of officers for human rights abuses during the dictatorship must end. <PERSON> Menem </PERSON> is said to favor an amnesty, which would anger human rights groups. A commission appointed by <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON> documented the cases of nearly 9,000 people who disappeared in 1976-83 and were presumed killed. Estimates by human rights organizations range up to 30,000.

 A violent storm that swept through southwestern <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> caused extensive damage to grapevines that produce some of the world's finest wines, vintners said Friday. The storm, which hit Thursday night, also was blamed for two deaths. Two men in a small plane were killed when they crashed while trying to land in <LOCATION> Pau </LOCATION>, 480 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>. The storm knocked down power lines, flooding factories, and shredding corn and tomato crops as well as the precious grapes of the Sauternes region. Many Sauternes were damaged, and some devastated. At Chateau d'Yquem, which produces a prized sweet white desert wine, proprietor <PERSON> Alexandre </PERSON> <PERSON> Lur </PERSON> <PERSON> Saluces </PERSON> said half his 1989 production was wiped out. Normally, Chateau d'Yquem produces about 75,000 bottles of wine from its 250 acres of vines in production. A bottle of 1983 Chateau d'Yquem, considered a top vintage by connoisseurs, sells for $ 150 to $ 225 in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>. `` More than 50 percent of the 1989 harvest has been wiped out, and I have to say a part of the 1990 harvest seems to be in question,'' said <LOCATION> Lur </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Saluces </LOCATION>, whose family has owned Chateau d'Yquem since 1786. Some other vineyards in the area lost up to 100 percent of their grapes for this year.

 <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> leaders wound up a week of talks Friday on how to integrate their economies and prepare the region for 1992, when trade barriers go down in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. Members of the 13-nation Caribbean Community and Common Market, or <ORGANIZATION> Caricom </ORGANIZATION>, said they took the first steps toward creating a <ORGANIZATION> Caribbean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, a <ORGANIZATION> Caribbean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> and an emergency fund for disaster relief. They also plan to ask the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> for an international conference on drugs and emphasize the need for a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> task force to combat drug trafficking in the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION>, a key transit route to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and European markets. A statement on <ORGANIZATION> Caricom </ORGANIZATION>'s position on drugs was expected after the five-day conference was scheduled to end Friday night. <LOCATION> Jamaica </LOCATION> Prime Minister <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Manley </PERSON> has urged the group to take action before 1992, when <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> is to form a single trading market that could affect trade protection the region currently enjoys on many of its exports. Among the key exports that could be adversely affected are sugar, bananas, rice and rum. <LOCATION> Jamaica </LOCATION>, along with <LOCATION> Trinidad </LOCATION> <LOCATION> and </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Tobago </LOCATION>, have the largest economies of the <ORGANIZATION> Caricom </ORGANIZATION> states and their leadership is seen as crucial to the success of the group. The meeting also included heads of government from <LOCATION> Antigua-Barbuda </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Bahamas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Barbados </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Belize </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Dominica </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Grenada </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Guyana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Montserrat </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kitts-Nevis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lucia </LOCATION> and <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> Vincent </PERSON>.

<HEAD>Brady Says Summit Unlikely to Change Economic Direction</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SALLY JACOBSEN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Treasury Secretary <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> said Friday leaders of the major industrialized nations are unlikely to shift economic direction at next week's summit in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>. `` We should bear in mind the economies of the world are doing very, very well,'' he told reporters in a satellite broadcast from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. `` I do n't think anybody's talking about changing the throttle settings at this particular point in time,'' he said. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and the leaders of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> will make their annual examination of their economies' health. <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> said officials probably will reiterate the statement issued last spring by finance ministers saying an excessive rise or fall in the value of the dollar would be counterproductive. He turned aside criticism that industrialized nations' spring efforts to stem the sharp rise in the dollar against other major currencies had been futile. `` I do n't subscribe to the line of thought that says that either policy coordination or intervention is a thing of the past,'' he said. `` I would only point out that markets do have from time to time volatile periods,'' he said. `` We had one this spring.'' He noted the dollar's value had come down in recent weeks and currency markets were quiet. `` I think the process is working very well,'' he said. Central banks of leading industrialized nations mounted an expensive campaign last spring to drive down the value of the dollar. They intervened heavily in the currency markets by selling dollars to try to change its value. Finance officials of the seven major industrial powers have pledged to work together to keep the dollar stable. <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> said there was no need to make the nations' cooperation on exchange rates more formal, as some European officials suggest. `` We do n't see any reason to change things in any material way and that would include a more rigid approach to exchange rates,'' he said. `` We think the market is doing its job, and we would feel very uneasy about tinkering with success.'' He also said the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration does not expect the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economy to slip into a recession but rather have a `` soft landing.'' `` Our economy has been going forward on an upward plane for the last seven years, so if that plane changes its slope a little bit ... then that is what we think is a soft landing _ growth at slower rate,'' he said. There have been growing fears of recession in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Analysts predicted the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> likely will loosen its credit policy further in an effort to drive down consumer and business interest rates. The Federal Reserve in March 1988 began a credit-tightening drive that lifted interest rates, a move designed to dampen inflationary pressures by reducing demands for borrowing. But the central bank, in a major policy shift, last month lowered a key interest rate, and analysts believe it shortly will reduce that rate again.

<HEAD>Tass Reports New Ethnic Clashes in Nagorno-Karabakh</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Members of two ethnic groups fought gunbattles Friday and tried to set buildings on fire in <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION>, one of the country's most volatile ethnic regions, the official <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> news agency said. The news agency said Armenians and <PERSON> Azerbaijanis </PERSON>, who have been feuding for 1 -LCB- years, shot at each other with hunting rifles in <LOCATION> Kirkijan </LOCATION>, a suburb of <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION>'s principal city, <LOCATION> Stepanakert </LOCATION>. `` A real likelihood of massive clashes between the Armenian and Azerbaijani populations was created,'' <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. The shooting lasted several hours and was accompanied by attempts to set private and public buildings ablaze with signal rockets, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. The report said some people had fled the village and hid in a forest. An Armenian and Azerbaijani were slightly wounded before police and <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> forces ended the clash, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. The dispatch also said hooligans were disrupting food supplies and telephone and telegraph service and staging demonstrations and sit-ins. Rumors are sweeping through <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION> that attacks on innocent residents are imminent, according to <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION>. Since 1923, <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION> has been part of the republic of <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION>, but Armenians, who make up three-quarters of the region's 162,000 inhabitants, claim that Azerbaijanis discriminate against them. They want the region to be annexed to the neighboring republic of <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> has refused, and in January, authorities in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> placed <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION> under <ORGANIZATION> Kremlin </ORGANIZATION> management. Strikes and demonstrations flared in the region and in <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> in February 1988 and continued sporadically throughout the year. More than 90 people were killed in the unrest. A general strike has been under way in the region since May 3, and <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> reported Tuesday it has cost <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION> $ 53.5 million in wages. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said the latest disturbances appeared designed to disrupt a visit to <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION> by a commission of the national parliament, the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deputies </ORGANIZATION>. The commission was formed last month to try to work out a compromise between Armenians and Azerbaijanis. Armenians have accused Soviet authorities of trying to increase the number of <LOCATION> Azerbaijans </LOCATION> in the district.

<TEXT>
 Moslem guerrillas said they stalled a government offensive Friday after losing a strategic garrison on the outskirts of the eastern city of <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION>. The guerrillas blamed the loss of the Samarkhiel garrison Thursday on a shortage of weapons and manpower. <PERSON> Abdul </PERSON> <PERSON> Kabir </PERSON>, a rebel spokesman, said Afghan government troops plowed through guerrilla-held positions before being halted about seven miles east of <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION>, in eastern <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. `` We could n't hold on,'' said <PERSON> Azim </PERSON> <PERSON> Nasser-Zia </PERSON>, whose guerrillas had held <PERSON> Samarkhiel </PERSON>. `` The mujahedeen did n't even have enough weapons for their own defense.'' <PERSON> Kabir </PERSON> agreed. `` We have a problem with this. We have only small weapons or ones that are not in good working condition.'' <PERSON> Nasser-Zia </PERSON> said the loss of <LOCATION> Samarkhiel </LOCATION>, which had been captured by the U.S.-backed guerrillas early in March, was a crushing blow. `` The only victory since the Russian withdrawal, and we lose it,'' he said. The Soviet army pulled the last of its troops from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> in February, ending a nine-year military involvement in the civil war. The guerrillas have been fighting 11 years to oust <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s Marxist government The insurgents, who call themselves mujahedeen, or Islamic holy warriors, launched an attack on <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION> in early March. After a month of some of the bloodiest fighting in 10 years of war, the offensive ended in a stalemate. The battle for <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION> destroyed predictions that the <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> government would collapse soon after the Soviet troop withdrawal. <PERSON> Nasser-Zia </PERSON> also blamed the defeat on the interim guerrilla government, saying it has drained many of the will to fight. The government was formed with the idea it would replace the <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> government, but it only has representatives from the guerrilla parties based in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>. It does not include representation for guerrillas based in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>.

 The head of the Iranian organization that arranges pilgrimages to <LOCATION> Mecca </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Medina </PERSON> said Friday that Iranians can skip the ritual for 10 years to protest Saudi control of the shrines, Iranian media reported. `` We are n't afraid if they do n't let us into Mecca to make the pilgrimage to the house of God for another 10 years,'' <PERSON> Mahdi </PERSON> <PERSON> Emam </PERSON> <PERSON> Jamarani </PERSON>, head of the Hajj organization, the official <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> reported. <PERSON> Jamarani </PERSON>, in a sermon in <LOCATION> Zahedan </LOCATION>, capital of southeastern <LOCATION> Sistan-Baluchestan </LOCATION>, said Iranians had been refused entry into <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> for two years already for the annual pilgrimage or hajj. Traveling once to the holy shrines at <LOCATION> Mecca </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Medina </PERSON> is one of the five basic duties of all Moslems.

More than 400 pilgrims, most Iranians, died in 1987 when <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> troops quelled a riot in <LOCATION> Mecca </LOCATION>. Last year, <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> imposed a quota of 1,000 pilgrims per 1 million population for all countries. The usual Iranian contingent of 150,000 would have been cut to a third that, and the Iranians stayed away in protest.

 <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, former baseball coach, took time out Friday from preparing for his trip to communist <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> to talk baseball with 4,000 Little Leaguers. `` In Little League all that matters is the size of your heart and of your dreams,'' he said to the kids.

The purpose was to mark the founding of <ORGANIZATION> Little </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> 50 years ago in <LOCATION> Williamsport </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa </LOCATION>.

You've got to start from way down when you are 6 or 7 years old and if you try hard enough you're bound to come out on top.'' With those words, said the president, <PERSON> Ruth </PERSON> `` defined why Little League baseball has become an American, indeed, an international institution. `` My four boys played it, I coached it, and <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> _ not many non baseball players could properly score a baseball games, but <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> did that, inning after inning,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` Like you, I know what makes Little League so special. It's a feeling of sportsmanship, generosity, teamwork, a feeling of family, fathers and daughters, mothers and sons.'' He said in the 50 years, 20 million youngsters had played Little League _ more than 2.5 million in 33 nations this year alone. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told the crowd that when he is in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> next week, he will have the pleasure of helping import Little League. And he said he will tell about <PERSON> Musial </PERSON> and <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Yastrzemski </PERSON>, both baseball greats of Polish extraction. `` In Little League all that matters is the size of your heart and of your dreams and ask these kids about it,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` Dreams are the essence of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and of baseball and Little League can propel those dreams. `` In the end what matters is how we conduct ourselves on as well as off the field. That's where Little league really connects, by building courage and character. It belts a grandslam home run by doing those two things.''

 A Solidarity official on Friday opposed any suggestions <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> should give up land that was in German hands before World War II. `` Those who question existing borders damage perspectives for stability in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Bronislaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Geremek </PERSON>, leader of Solidarity's deputies in the Polish parliament.

The impasse forced <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> to call off a visit to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> he had tentatively planned this month. <PERSON> Geremek </PERSON> said he sees `` new chances for -LRB- closer -RRB- relations between Germans and Poles,'' and that problems holding up the agreement `` are only of the second order.'' Relations were cooled further by <PERSON> Waigel </PERSON>'s comment on Sunday that Germans still have a legal right to parts of <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> _ including large sections of <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> _ that once belonged to <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. `` The German Empire did not cease with the capitulation of the German army on May 8, 1945,'' <PERSON> Waigel </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Hanover </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> reacted angrily to <PERSON> Waigel </PERSON>'s remarks, and his comments drew negative responses from <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> and <PERSON> Genscher </PERSON>. <PERSON> Genscher </PERSON> said in a radio interview Friday that current frontier agreements `` are accepted by everybody'' and `` leave no room for discussion.'' <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> said on West German television Thursday night: `` No one in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> must fear that we Germans are revisionists.'' In his talks with <PERSON> Geremek </PERSON> and other Solidarity leaders, <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> said he considers closer ties with <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> `` a special matter, in view of the burden and tragedy of our common history,'' said the chancellor's spokesman, <PERSON> Hans </PERSON> <PERSON> Klein </PERSON>. `` The chancellor said he considers the situation is ripe now for a major step in creating friendly relations'' between the two countries, <PERSON> Klein </PERSON> told reporters. <PERSON> Geremek </PERSON> said Solidarity agrees with the West German position that any new financial credit for <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> must be linked to definite projects, which was not the case with aid to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> in the 1970s. He also said any new credit to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> should be based on successful economic reforms in his homeland. `` <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> does not want to be <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s beggar,'' he said. `` We want to underscore that only a reformed economy is worthy of asking for support. That would ensure not only that the credit would be paid back'' but also that countries that invest in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> can make a profit, he said.

<HEAD>Oil-Eating Microorganisms May Munch on Alaskan Oil Spill</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Officials of the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said Friday they are optimistic that oil-eating microorganisms may soon become valuable tools in cleaning up the Exxon oil spill in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> Administrator <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Reilly </PERSON> said preliminary findings from an experiment in which nutrients were used to enhance the growth of such organisms on small sections of <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>'s contaminated beaches appear to show success. In some cases, the number of organisms multiplied 100-fold only a week into the experiment and even in the early stages some beaches treated with nutrients showed `` a striking disappearance of the oil from rock surfaces,'' the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> said. <PERSON> Reilly </PERSON> said that the results were `` potentially good news'' and that if the preliminary findings hold up <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> may begin later this summer to treat large sections of beach with nutrients to enhance oil-eating microorganism growth. <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Brathauer </PERSON>, assistant administrator for research and development, said it will be several weeks before some remaining questions about the experiment will be resolved. The <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> began using nutrients to enhance microrganism growth on six test plots along <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>'s contaminated <LOCATION> King </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> beaches June 8 in hopes the growth would spur oil degredation. Some degredation has been observed in untreated areas, but in many cases there are too few microorganisms to make a significant impact. But <PERSON> Brathauer </PERSON> said the nutrients acted as a fertilizer and brought about significant increases in levels of oil-eating organisms in the test areas. He said so far there have been no signs of any side effects detrimental to the environment. In addition to the rapid growth of the microorganisms in the test areas, there has been a noticeable cleaning of rock surfaces that had not been anticipated so early, said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Valentinetti </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> official involved in the project. Rock surfaces on which the nutrients were applied became much cleaner shortly after contact similar to soap releasing dirt from an object. But the officials warned that the cleaning may have been a physical reaction and not biological. <PERSON> Valentinetti </PERSON> said in an interview that the agency hopes to learn more about the cleansing action within the next few weeks and determine whether it was a biological reaction. He said it remains uncertain whether the oil that came off the rocks actually degraded or was simply transported. The <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> estimates that anywhere from 700 miles to 1,200 miles of <LOCATION> Alaskan </LOCATION> coastline _ much of it shear rock and boulders _ have been contaminated by the March 24 <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Valdez </ORGANIZATION> spill in Prince <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sound </PERSON>. <PERSON> Valentinetti </PERSON> said use of the oil-eating microorganisms is expected to be most productive along about 100 miles of shoreline where there is sand and sediment. He said <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> has estimated it would cost about $ 5 million to treat 50 miles of beach with the nutrient fertilizer to enhance microorganism growth. Most areas likely would require more than one treatment, officials suggested. That cost would be only a small portion of the overall cleanup costs facing Exxon.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>'s supreme commander in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, Gen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Galvin </PERSON>, said Friday that Western tracking of the pilotless MiG-23 that zoomed across <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> undetected by Soviet radar proved the allied alert system works. On another issue, <PERSON> Galvin </PERSON> reacted coolly to Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s offer in <LOCATION> Strasbourg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, Thursday to make another unilateral cut in short-range nuclear missiles. `` The main thing threatening us is overwhelming -LRB- Soviet -RRB- conventional forces,'' <PERSON> Galvin </PERSON> told a meeting of American reporters. `` I question whether or not we are in a safer world in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> today than we were, say, 10 years ago.'' On the runaway plane, <PERSON> Galvin </PERSON> said two <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> F-15 fighters scrambled from a <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> base in <LOCATION> The </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION> `` as a policing action'' as it crossed into <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> Tuesday. They shadowed it, hoping it would reach the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION>, but it crashed in <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>, killing a man. <PERSON> Galvin </PERSON> said he accepted <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s explanation that it was an accident. The pilot ejected over <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> after reporting the plane was smoking. The Soviets say their radar missed the MiG-23 as it flew on for 500 miles. The incident recalled the failure of Soviet air defenses to detect a small plane flown by German amateur pilot <PERSON> Mathias </PERSON> <PERSON> Rust </PERSON>, who landed in Red Square. `` <PERSON> Mathias </PERSON> <PERSON> Rust </PERSON> is one thing _ a little tiny plane flying at low altitudes.'' said <PERSON> Galvin </PERSON>. `` But this plane took off from their own airfield and was flying at high altitude.'' A Soviet officer, Lt. Col. <PERSON> Anatoly </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Balikin </PERSON>, said in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> it was not practical or economical to monitor every plane. <PERSON> Galvin </PERSON> said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> pilots did not shoot down the MiG-23 or move alongside and tip it over because it was over populated areas. Regarding <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s offer, he said that although the Soviets had 1,400 short-range missiles launchers compared with <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>'s 88, <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s conventional superiority was a bigger threat. `` If we get into the shorter-range nuclear forces too early we're giving away the major motivating idea because the Soviets do want to see us get rid of nuclear weapons,'' said <PERSON> Galvin </PERSON> `` They are not so anxious to get rid of conventional weapons.'' Last month <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> told <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> he will withdraw 500 short-range missiles unilaterally. They have a range of up to 310 miles. <PERSON> Galvin </PERSON> said that despite the appeal of glasnost, or openness, he questioned whether <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> was safer because of the risk of Soviet instability. `` I applaud the way the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> is moving,'' said <PERSON> Galvin </PERSON>. `` But it's a rocky road they're heading down. They're saying they ca n't turn back but they do n't know precisely where they're going.''

<DATELINE>MADRID, Spain (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION>'s chief guardian of doctrine Friday praised last week's <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruling that allows states to restrict abortion. `` The decision is a sign of the birth of a new moral consciousness on abortion,'' Roman Catholic Cardinal <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Ratzinger </PERSON> said at a news conference at <ORGANIZATION> Madrid </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. `` It is a kind of move away from earlier attitudes, where I see a reflection that weighs more on the side of the value of human life,'' said the prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, which makes sure that church officials adhere to Catholic doctrine. <PERSON> Ratzinger </PERSON> made the comments after delivering a lecture titled `` Jesus Christ Today'' at a university seminar. In its decision issued on July 3, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> voted 5-4 to give the states broad powers to restrict the availability of abortions. The ruling narrowed the court's 1973 decision legalizing abortion. On another topic, <PERSON> Ratzinger </PERSON> denied a recent Brazilian newspaper report that the church had decided to order new sanctions against the Rev. <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> <PERSON> Boff </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>, a leading proponent of liberation theology. In 1985, the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> sentenced <PERSON> Boff </PERSON> to nearly a year of `` obedient silence'' because of books he wrote that criticized the <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> for not doing enough to aid the poor in the Third World. Liberation theology stresses social activism by <PERSON> Catholics </PERSON> on behalf of the oppressed. Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> has objected to forms of liberation theology that embrace Marxist theory. <PERSON> Ratzinger </PERSON> said the <PERSON> pope </PERSON> believes the theology to be `` useful and necessary at times.'' `` But other aspects that present deviations motivated by politics are not very correct,'' he said. <PERSON> Ratzinger </PERSON> also denied that the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> had been more severe with liberal theologians than with ultra-conservative church figures such as French Archbishop <PERSON> Marcel </PERSON> <PERSON> Lefebvre </PERSON>, who was excommunicated for challenging the pope's authority.

<HEAD>FAA Toughens Policy On Security Bulletins</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BRISCOE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The government announced a stricter policy Friday to deal with threats against aviation, including a system that requires airlines to take countermeasures and imposes fines for disclosing security alerts. A <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> order, which will go into effect Monday, replaces the system of issuing security bulletins, which was criticized after the bombing of <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> Flight 103 over <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION> last December that killed 270 people. Notices of threats against <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> airlines on the flight's route were posted in at least one foreign embassy but not distributed to the general public. Under the new order, individuals or airlines that disclose information from government security alerts without <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> authorizaton will be fined _ up to $ 1,000 for individuals and $ 10,000 for airlines. <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Leyden </PERSON> said the system for alerting airlines will now include two types of adivsories: information circulars and security directives. The information circulars will deal with general threats of hijackings, bombings or other terrorist actions, <PERSON> Leyden </PERSON> said. `` They are basically a heads-up warning and would require no particular action,'' he said. The security directives, however, would require countermeasures by an airline, such as additional baggage inspections, <PERSON> Leyden </PERSON> said. These would be in response to specific threats against an airline, an airport or an individual flight and might include such information as the threatened time and method of attack, he said. Previously, airlines were not required to take any specific actions in response to security bulletins. The <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION>, in a news release on the new order, said airlines have been responsive to actions suggested in security bulletins but making compliance mandatory will strengthen security. Since 1986, the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> has issued 93 security bulletings, about one-third of them warning of specific threats. In the case of Flight 103, an <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> advisory had been issued about the threat of a bomb aboard a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> airline flight from <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> flight originated in <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> with a different plane, but <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> authorities said they concluded that the threat was not related to the bombing of Flight 103. Other warnings were issued about the possibility of plastic explosives concealed in a radio-cassette player. Investigators said that such a bomb caused the <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> explosion, although they have not found who planted the device. Relatives of Americans killed in the Pan Am bombing have called for public advisories whenever there is a threat against aviation, saying passengers have a right to know when they are boarding an aircraft that has been threatened. Transportation Secretary <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> has rejected the suggestion, saying it would disrupt aviation and compromise intelligence gathering. On Thursday, the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> announced new rules requiring airlines to install units that can detect plastic explosives in checked luggage at 40 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and foreign airports. It did not list the airports, except for <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gatwick </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, and said it would take two or three years before all the units are installed.

 A woman will spend 45 days in jail for serving food to the city's street people. <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Loranger </PERSON>, 49, of <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cruz </LOCATION> who was charged with not having a permit to provide the food, was given the jail term Thursday by <ORGANIZATION> Municipal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Atack </PERSON>. <PERSON> Loranger </PERSON>, standing outside the courtroom, promised to keep feeding hungry people in <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cruz </LOCATION>, a popular coastal city about 70 miles south of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. `` I fully intend to keep on doing it,'' said <PERSON> Loranger </PERSON>, who does not have to begin her jail term until next week. She added she would stop her activities `` only if unconditional food is made available -LRB- to the poor -RRB- on a daily basis ... but not until.'' She was sent to jail because she refused to accept probation, under which she would be required to `` obey all laws.'' <PERSON> Loranger </PERSON>, a partner in an antique store, is the first of the activists working for the city's homeless population to receive a jail term for handing out food. She was cited Feb. 21 during one of the meals the activists served at the Town Clock in downtown <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cruz </LOCATION>. The city began requiring the permits earlier this year because too many homeless persons were gathering in a busy section of town where the activists were serving them meals.

<TEXT>
 Guerrillas ambushed a police patrol and started a gun battle in which seven rebels, six policemen and a civilian were killed, the government said Friday. In <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION>, guerrillas planted eight bombs at banks and private companies, four of which exploded, police reported. An <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> statement said members of <ORGANIZATION> Shining </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Path </ORGANIZATION>, a Maoist guerrilla group, ambushed the patrol Thursday in the <LOCATION> Puno </LOCATION> region, 600 miles southeast of the capital near <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Titicaca </LOCATION>. The report said one policeman was wounded in the half-hour battle, which ended when police reinforcements arrived. The civilian killed had been hitching a ride on the police vehicle when it was attacked, police said. Guerrillas of the pro-Cuban Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement were responsible for the bombs in <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION>, the police said. Four of bombs went off simultaneously at about 10:30 p.m. Thursday at offices of the <ORGANIZATION> Peru </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Construction </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> and the Grana y Montero construction company, a tile factory and an auto parts store. Bomb squads defused the others, which were planted near downtown banks. Construction workers went on strike Monday for higher wages, and their union held violent demostrations Wednesday and Thursday in downtown <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION>. Four members of the construction union were wounded and one was killed Thursday in a confrontation with police after a march. A policeman was wounded when a stick of dynamite was thrown from a crowd of workers. Police did not comment on whether the explosions were related to the strike. Shining Path began fighting nine years ago in the Andes and its insurgency has spread to other areas. The Tupac Amaru group made its appearance in 1984, and generally carries out bombings in cities. More than 15,000 people have been killed since the guerrilla war began, according to government figures.

The Los Angeles-based center is an international organization whose goal is combating prejudice.. On June 14, <PERSON> Samuels </PERSON> sent a letter to <ORGANIZATION> Michelin </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Michelin </PERSON> asking that the map be withdrawn and reprinted `` At the very best we think this map is a blight on the reputation for geograhical accuracy of <ORGANIZATION> Michelin </ORGANIZATION> guides and maps,'' he said in a telephone interview from <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. The front cover of the map of `` <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>'' displays a small section of the full map. The cutout omits <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and shows instead a dotted line frontier running between <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>, which occupied the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> from 1948 to 1967. The full map avoids the issue by placing in the area where <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> would be located a small inserted map of the entire African continent with the phone number for the <ORGANIZATION> Michelin </ORGANIZATION> company. A spokesman at <ORGANIZATION> Michelin </ORGANIZATION>'s office here said the letter was received two days ago by the department responsible for cartography, which intended to respond. The spokesman, who spoke anonymously in keeping with company policy, said the response `` will be private and not given in the press.''

Blacks comprise about 21 percent of <LOCATION> Dade </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>'s 1.85 million residents, the bulk of whom live in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>.

City Manager <PERSON> Cesar </PERSON> <PERSON> Odio </PERSON> said he `` agreed with the general tone of the report'' to be discussed by city commissioners next week. But Police Chief <PERSON> Perry </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> criticized most of the panel's suggestions as unnecessary He said internal police investigators do an adequate job following up citizens' complaints and the 24-hour operation of the substation is not needed even though the police shooting that triggered the riots occurred across the street from the station when it was closed. Three nights of looting and arson in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>'s black neighborhoods were triggered by the fatal shooting of a black motorcyclist by a Hispanic police officer Jan. 16. `` The whole incident was spontaneous,'' said <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>. `` The results would have been exactly the same if the mini-station was open.'' <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> also defended the equality of the department's hiring practices. `` What we need to do is generate enough black recruits to go through the system,'' he said. The panel found that between 1974 and March 1989, 46 percent of the black candidates failed to complete the five-month program at the <ORGANIZATION> Southeast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Criminal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>. The panel claims 37 percent of Hispanic candidates and 17 percent of Anglos dropped from the program during the same period. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Stinchcomb </PERSON>, director of the institute, says the current attrition rate is only 3 percent to 4 percent for all applicants and the panel's figures may reflect some problems during the 1970s. <PERSON> Stinchcomb </PERSON> said dropout rates declined after the institute revamped its firing range test and some academic exams in 1981. `` The numbers the panel is throwing out is no reflection on the current situation,'' he said.

 <LOCATION> PORT-AU-PRINCE </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- _ A prominent politician said Friday that gunmen fired on his home in an attack that came one day after gunmen burglarized the home of another politician and killed his brother. <PERSON> Jean-Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Roy </PERSON>, head of the small centrist Union of Haitian Constitutionalists party, said that at midnight Thursday three or four gunmen began shooting at his house from his driveway in suburban <LOCATION> Freres </LOCATION>, east of <LOCATION> Port-au-Prince </LOCATION>. He said he and his three private security guards shot in the air and scared them away. On Thursday, Dr. <PERSON> Turneb </PERSON> <PERSON> Delpe </PERSON>, a critic of <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION>'s military government, said two gunmen burst into his <LOCATION> Port-au-Prince </LOCATION> home and shot to death his younger brother <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON>. <PERSON> Delpe </PERSON>, head of the small leftist <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Progressive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, said the gunmen stole $ 4,000. <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION>'s ruler, Lt.

<HEAD>Pentagon Announces B-2 Flight Test For Next Week</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> announced on Friday that the long-awaited first flight tests for the B-2 stealth bomber will be held during a 15-day period beginning Sunday. The controversial plane, which is the most radical and expensive bomber ever built, has become the target of budget cutters on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>. Critics in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> have expressed opposition to footing the bill for planes that could cost anyhwere between $ 500 million and $ 750 million a copy before the first plane has ever gotten off the ground. The plane, described as resembling a `` flying wing'' without conventional fuselage, is designed to penetrate Soviet borders without being detected by radar. The plane has no sharp angles and relies on the use of radar-absorbing coatings on its surface. In total, the program is expected to cost taxpayers some $ 70 billion. To date, the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> has invested $ 22 billion into the program. In a statement issued late Friday afternoon, the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> said that the plane is scheduled for `` outdoor tests and the first flight'' during a 15-day period beginning July 9. The plane has been undergoing a final check at an <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> plant in <LOCATION> Palmdale </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif </LOCATION>. The plane has been built and manufactured by <ORGANIZATION> Northrop </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. During the 15-day period, the plane is expected to be rolled out of its hangar and undergo a series of dress rehearsal tests that include turning on its engines, slow and high-speed taxi tests on the runway and then, a full flight test For its initial flight, the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> plans to take the plane from <LOCATION> Palmdale </LOCATION> for an approximately 2 -LCB- hour test flight, landing at <ORGANIZATION> Edwards </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION>, about 40 miles away, said Capt. <PERSON> Tess </PERSON> <PERSON> Taft </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman at <LOCATION> Palmdale </LOCATION>. The tests may take several days, but there can be no exact date given for the test flight, Capt. <PERSON> Taft </PERSON> said. `` Only after it looks perfect, and everything looks right, will they take it up. And you never know what day that will be,'' she said. While the news media will be allowed to observe the outdoor tests, the public `` is not invited,'' the statement issue at the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> said. The specific date and time of the tests will not be announced in advance, but the media will be informed by midmorning if no tests are scheduled for a particular day, the statement said. The <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> will hold a news conference following the first flight, the statement said. While the B-2 has not been operationally tested in the field yet, individual systems were tried out along the way. The <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> says the B-2 will not be deployed before 1991.

 The Democrats' national chairman on Friday accused the Republicans of merely paying lip service to Hispanics and pledged grass-roots efforts to give Spanish-speaking Americans more political clout. `` We Democrats know that empowerment begins not with political tokenism at the top, but with a commitment at the local level,'' <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> told the annual convention of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Latin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Citizens </ORGANIZATION>. Labor Secretary <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> spoke to the group later, emphasizing a pending jobs bill rather than politics. Mrs. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said her No. 1 priority is to reduce minority youth unemployment and she asked the group's support for a <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration bill that would refocus the government's job-training program. She said minority youth unemployment is a staggering 32.4 percent, while the jobless rate for young Hispanics averages 22 percent. The nation's overall unemployment rate is 5.3 percent. Mrs. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said Hispanic employment at the <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> rose by 25 percent while she was secretary during the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration, and `` I intend to get the same results at the Department of Labor.'' <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> told the group earlier, `` You'll hear about President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> appointing <PERSON> Lauro </PERSON> <PERSON> Cavazos </PERSON> secretary of education,'' he said. `` You wo n't hear about the cuts in Secretary <PERSON> Cavazos </PERSON>' budget or about Republican support for ` English only' education.'' He said the Democrats are `` committed, absolutely committed to bilingual education and committed to defeating ` English only' amendments no matter what state they appear in. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> also said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> `` just said no'' when the Democratic-controlled <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> requested $ 81 million in additional funding this year for combating drugs. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> took particular aim at <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s budget proposal for Head Start, saying `` more than three out of four needy kids still wo n't get help.'' `` Thousands of children in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> L.A. </LOCATION> are on the slow track before they get to Mr. <PERSON> Escalante </PERSON>'s classroom,'' he said, referring to <PERSON> Jaime </PERSON> <PERSON> Escalante </PERSON>, the dynamic teacher who inspired the movie `` Stand and Deliver'' and has become a hero of the administration. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> addressed the scandal in the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> as well, saying, `` When people in ` colonias' -LRB- shanty towns -RRB- go without running water and plumbing while -LRB- former <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> Secretary -RRB- <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Watt </PERSON> makes $ 300,000 for a few hours work as a housing consultant, something is out of kilter. In his speech and in remarks afterward, <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> repeatedly criticized the Republicans as masters of a Madison Avenue approach to politics, while he said the Democrats are still close to the people. But he also acknowledged the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> has made inroads with Hispanic voters, especially in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. Addressing the fundamentals of building party strength, <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said after the speech, `` there is nothing more crucial than the 1990 census'' for the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and its efforts to reach minorities. Census data are used to draw congressional districts. Census officials say they could have missed as many as 3.5 million blacks and Hispanics in the 1980 census, while `` we think it's about twice that amount,'' he said. He said the party will `` make sure the <ORGANIZATION> Census </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> knows they are watched.'' <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> also said the party needs to do more to register Hispanic voters, and he acknowledged that Republicans have done a better job of winning the allegiance of resident aliens in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> by courting them in the years before they become citizens. About 60 percent of eligible Hispanics have not registered to vote, he said. The <ORGANIZATION> Census </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> estimated the Hispanic population at 17.5 million in 1985. Mrs. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, talking about jobs for minorities, said she and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> crafted legislation that redirects the Job Training Partnership Act from merely a `` training for a job'' program to one that will provide skills training, literacy and remedial education and counseling. `` Each individual in the program will be assessed for his or her particular needs, and goals will be set to meet those needs _ in short, a total support system will be available. Funding will depend not on how many kids are trained and pushed into jobs slots _ but on achievement and longer term evaluation. There will be follow-up after six months on the job, and a year later, to determine progress.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> urged members of the group, billed as the largest and oldest Hispanic organization in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, to attend a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee markup of the bill next Wednesday.

 Veterans officials were unable to prove they had checked the licenses of more than half the doctors they hired from 1986 to 1988, according to a published report Friday. According to a draft of a <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> study obtained by The <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>, officials in the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Veterans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> have failed to verify credentials for doctors and medical residents at the nation's 172 VA hospitals. `` By not following applicable procedures, <ORGANIZATION> VA </ORGANIZATION> medical centers could unknowingly hire ` problem' physicians and-or be allowing physicians with sanctions against their licenses to treat veterans,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> quoted the report as saying. The VA, declining direct comment on the report, issued a statement Friday saying: `` Secretary -LRB- <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> J </PERSON>. -RRB- <PERSON> Derwinski </PERSON> views <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> studies as an effective, independent management guide aiming for better quality care for veterans. <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> is concurrently conducting major management studies at <ORGANIZATION> VA </ORGANIZATION> at <PERSON> Derwinski </PERSON>'s request. VA and <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> are partners in seeking and delivering quality care for vets.'' The Vietnam Veterans of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> said the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> report and an earlier report on mortality rates at <ORGANIZATION> VA </ORGANIZATION> hospitals show that veterans with service-connected disabilities should be allowed to seek health care from the provider of their choice. `` If the government is unable to provide acceptable health care through the veterans hospital system, then these veterans should have the right to seek medical treatment elsewhere,'' said <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stout </PERSON>, president of the 35,000-member group. <ORGANIZATION> VA </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Donna </PERSON> <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> John </PERSON> said the group is making a false comparison. `` Any attempt to connect the mortality review or the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> report with the quality of care is totally inappropriate,'' she said, explaining that mortality rates fail to reflect the condition of the patients who enter a particular hospital. Hospices, for example, have reported 100 percent rates. She noted that the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> report, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>, said: `` The conditions cited do not mean that the medical services provided by the <ORGANIZATION> VA </ORGANIZATION> are substandard or that <ORGANIZATION> VA </ORGANIZATION> physicians are incompetent.'' The <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> study was requested two years ago by Sen. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Murkowski </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Alaska </LOCATION>, ranking minority member of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Veterans </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> His staff said it could not release a copy of the report because it was in draft form. The <ORGANIZATION> VA </ORGANIZATION> said it could not release the draft report, either. The full report, with <ORGANIZATION> VA </ORGANIZATION> comment, is due for release in August. <PERSON> Murkowski </PERSON> wrote a 1985 law telling the VA to act on those problems after the American Medical Association found 87 doctors were working for the agency even though their licenses had been revoked, suspended or restricted. VA officials said they could prove they had checked the licenses of only 105 of the 207 physicians hired from 1986 to 1988, the report said. The report also said the <ORGANIZATION> VA </ORGANIZATION> had not fulfilled promises to ensure that its doctors are qualified to practice their particular specialties. A further problem was detected with medical residents who work at VA hospitals, according to the draft report. The government watchdog agency said a records check with the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> found that 165 of the 16,756 residents had been charged with criminal offenses between the early 1970s and May 1987, the Post reported. Among the more serious offenses were 68 charged with drunken driving and 67 charged with drug violations, five with vandalism and five with burglary. The records did not indicate how many charges led to convictions.

 A millionaire who handed out $ 10,000 checks on the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> floor while legislation that interested him was pending said the checks were political contributions, not an attempt to bribe lawmakers. `` It would be difficult to make it into a bribery case,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Travis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> Attorney <PERSON> Ronnie </PERSON> <PERSON> Earle </PERSON>, who believes it's time to change <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>' loose campaign finance laws. `` In <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, it's almost impossible to bribe a public official as long as you report it. The $ 10,000 personal checks, with the payee's name left blank, were offered by <PERSON> Lonnie </PERSON> `` Bo'' Pilgrim, an East <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> chicken processor, to nine of the 31 senators two days before Friday's vote on a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> workers' compensation bill. Business interests have favored the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> plan, but senators rejected it. <PERSON> Pilgrim </PERSON> said he was concerned about the high cost of workers' compensation in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and that he would like a law that would be a `` win-win situation for all of us. `` The common practice of mine is to give large contributions to people _ preachers, educational institutions and politicians _ and $ 10,000 or $ 100,000 is a common practice with me,'' Pilgrim said. `` It's primarily just for the name identification with the politicians ... They will answer your calls and give you an appointment and listen to you describe an issue. It does not infer a bribe,'' Pilgrim said. Most lawmakers said they returned the checks _ or planned to. But Sen. O.H. `` Ike'' <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> said he saw nothing wrong with accepting the money. Blank payee lines like those on Pilgrim's checks are common _ because many people do n't know the formal name of a politician's campaign committee, <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> said `` I've received campaign contributions that size before. If the principle's wrong, it do n't matter if it's a dollar or a million, right? Everybody's got a different style,'' <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> law does not limit campaign contributions, although officeholders are barred from raising money during regular legislative sessions. There is no such prohibition on special sessions, and the <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> has been in special session for three weeks. `` I think it's outrageous. It offends the integrity of the whole process,'' said <PERSON> Earle </PERSON>. `` It looks horrible,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Kent </PERSON> <PERSON> Caperton </PERSON>. `` When I first heard it, I thought they were joking. It's just so outrageous. The law needs to be changed,'' said <PERSON> Caperton </PERSON>. `` We need more limits about when we can take money and how much.'' Rep. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON> said he was introducing a bill to prohibit campaign contributions on the Capitol grounds. `` Such overt attempts to influence the way laws are made should be stopped,'' <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON> said.

 <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> told the other Soviet bloc leaders Friday they are free to pursue their own views of communism, but suggested his own program of economic and social reform as a guide. `` Each country and each party has its own specifics and can continue its own individual road to socialist democracy and progress,'' he said in a dinner toast after the first day of a <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact summit. His host at the banquet was President <PERSON> Nicolae </PERSON> <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>, the most vocal critic of <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s reforms. The alliance's seven members are divided over the new policies, with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> on the liberal side and <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> sticking to the orthodox course. Their purposes at this summit are to discuss Western arms-reduction proposals and the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact's role in a new world where <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> speaks of a `` common European home'' with no threat or fear of war. In his dinner toast, the Soviet president said: `` We took new steps today toward <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> security, rapprochement and East-West dialogue.'' He also condemned unspecified `` forces'' that want military confrontation. <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON> renewed what he described as the Soviet bloc's `` appeal to <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> to give up its policy of nuclear deterrence.'' Neither he nor <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> mentioned what was decided Friday. Reporters were barred from the conference itself, but were admitted to the banquet hall in the former royal palace long enough to hear the brief dinner toasts. Soviet <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Gennady </PERSON> <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON> told an earlier news briefing <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and his colleagues discussed <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> proposals for reducing conventional forces, and how the Soviet bloc `` should change, adapt ... become contemporary.'' `` Everybody would agree there are vast changes, in our country, in the world,'' <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON> said. `` They are talking about the role of the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact in these changing conditions.'' <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON> was evasive about whether the topics at the two-day summit would include political divisions within the bloc. <PERSON> Ion </PERSON> <PERSON> Diaconu </PERSON> of the Romanian <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> refused comment on a report by the Soviet news agency Novosti that the leaders were discussing creation of a <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact `` political commission'' to arbitrate disputes between members. <PERSON> Diaconu </PERSON> denied reports that <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> had requested a discussion at the summit of its feud with <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> over <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>'s alleged mistreatment of its 1.7 million ethnic Hungarians. <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON> said disputes within the bloc were not on the agenda, but `` each delegation can say a few words about its own problems.'' He said <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and other leaders addressed the meeting Friday, but gave no details of the deliberations. Reporters were admitted to the palace for a few minutes while <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON> greeted his guests. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> last month that the <LOCATION> Bucharest </LOCATION> summit would respond to President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s proposal May 29 for a joint reduction in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet troops stationed in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> to 275,000 for each side by 1993, accompanied by cuts in combat aircraft and other conventional weapons. The Soviet leader said the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> proposal, which will not be on the table until September, had increased chances for quick agreement at <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> negotiations on conventional forces. He also is pushing for talks with <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> on reducing tactical, or short-range, nuclear weapons in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, but the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> wants the issue tied to cuts in conventional forces. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, where most of <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>'s battlefield nuclear weapons are stationed, favors talks. The disagreement between the two allies subsided after <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> made his conventional disarmament offer and said it could be agreed within a year. On Thursday, during a visit to <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> again tried to push the Western alliance into talks on the short-range weapons, offering the possibility of more unilateral cuts in the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION>'s nuclear arsenal if <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> agreed His last offer to scrap nuclear weapons _ about 500 warheads _ came in May during a visit to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> by Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, while <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> was arguing about short-range missiles. There was unconfirmed speculation in <LOCATION> Bucharest </LOCATION> that documents released after the summit ends Saturday might include numbers for the <LOCATION> Strasbourg </LOCATION> offer. Presidents, <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chiefs, premiers, defense and foreign ministers and other ranking offiials from the seven <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact nations are attending the summit. Romanian television broadcast scenes of delegations arriving on Thursday. <PERSON> Rezsoe </PERSON> <PERSON> Nyers </PERSON>, the Hungarian party chairman, appeared to be the only delegation head <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON> did not greet with a comradely kiss on the cheek. After <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> arrived, reporters asked him what he expected of the summit. `` I'll tell you when we've finished,'' he said.

<UNK>Court Allows Material Which Got Harper's Banned In Britain</UNK>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The government has lost a legal battle to stop publication of a retired intelligence agent's book after banning an American magazine that published excerpts. The House of Lords, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s top court, ruled on Thursday that `` Inside Intelligence'' by <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Cavendish </PERSON> could be published because the government had acknowledged the book was not a threat to national security. The government barred distribution in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> of last December's issue of the American magazine <ORGANIZATION> Harper </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION>, which carried excerpts It was the second major defeat for Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s attempts to gag former intelligence agents. Last October, the five-judge court rejected a long and costly attempt through British and foreign courts to ban publication of `` Spy Catcher,'' the memoirs of another ex-agent, <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>. Two Scottish newspapers and <ORGANIZATION> Scottish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION>, which fought the Cavendish case, hailed the judgment as a victory over what critics call excessive secretiveness by the <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> government. `` It was an overweening use of government authority,'' said <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>, editor of the <ORGANIZATION> Glasgow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION>. `` The government resorted to the tactics of the bully to try to intimidate the press,'' he said. The Thatcher government says it is seeking to hold ex-agents to a vow of lifelong silence. <PERSON> Harper </PERSON>'s publisher, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> MacArthur </PERSON>, had threatened to fight the magazine case in the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION>. But <PERSON> Cavendish </PERSON>, a 62-year-old merchant banker, said he had not given <PERSON> Harper </PERSON>'s permission to publish the excerpts <PERSON> Cavendish </PERSON>, an agent from 1948-53 in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s foreign intelligence operation, described spying in East bloc countries. He also claimed that <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> resigned abruptly as British <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> prime minister in 1976 because the Soviet <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION> had embarrassing information about him. In December 1987 <PERSON> Cavendish </PERSON>, defying government instructions not to publish the book, had 500 copies printed at this own expense and sent them to friends as Christmas cards. A Scottish legislator passed the book on to a newspaper, The Scotsman.

 The vast majority of assault weapons barred from importation since spring will be banned permanently from this country, the government announced Friday. The ban imposed on 43 styles of semiautomatic weapons _ including the popular Chinese-made AK-47 and Israeli-made <PERSON> Uzi </PERSON> carbine _ followed a four-month study by the <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alcohol </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tobacco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Firearms </ORGANIZATION> on whether the weapons met the standards imposed by the Gun Control Act of 1968, which barred importation of weapons that are not used for legitimate sporting purposes. `` The study was undertaken because of the dramatic increase in the number of these weapons being imported and police reports of their use in violent crime,'' said <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> ATF </ORGANIZATION> bureau. While the 43 were banned permanently, another seven whose imports had been suspended since early spring will be available for import again as a result of the study. Those include six .22 rimfire caliber rifles and a gun called the <ORGANIZATION> Valmet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hunter </ORGANIZATION>, which had been considered an AK-47 type of weapon during the suspension. <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> ATF </ORGANIZATION>, which studied the marketing and use of the weapons, said the models banned were `` not being used for sporting uses.'' Such weapons were identified officially Friday as `` semiautomatic assault rifles.'' The <ORGANIZATION> ATF </ORGANIZATION> annually traces 35,000 to 40,000 guns used in crime, and about 10 percent of them are semiautomatic assault weapons, <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> said, estimating that slightly more than half of them were domestic makes that are not subject to <ORGANIZATION> ATF </ORGANIZATION> control. `` We're not saying that it will solve the basic problem'' of crime, <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> said, adding, `` Their use in crime is probably disproportionately high compared with the number that are here.'' Holding aloft one of the banned weapons _ an Israeli-made Galil rifle _ <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> pointed out some of the accoutrements that led to its prohibition: a folding stock, a night sight, a flash suppressor on the end that could serve as a grenade launcher, its ability to accept a bayonet lug, a pistol grip and a large magazine. In the future, he said, weapons with several of these features probably also would be subject to an import ban. <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> estimated that the <ORGANIZATION> Customs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> has seized about 20,000 of the weapons and that those will not be allowed into the country unless purchased by law enforcement agencies. Asked whether the government will pay damages to importers, <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> said, `` That's something the court would decide. Three importers already have brought suit against the government over the suspension, and although a district court has upheld the government in one of the cases, <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> ATF </ORGANIZATION> would accept comments on the permanent ban from any importers for 30 days. The final regulations would be issued `` very quickly'' after that, he said. Asked why the <ORGANIZATION> ATF </ORGANIZATION> previously had allowed imports of the now-banned weapons, <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> said the committee set up after the 1968 law was passed to determine whether guns qualified for import had `` concentrated primarily, almost exclusive, on handguns.'' It was n't until the number of assault-style weapons being imported increased dramatically that the <ORGANIZATION> ATF </ORGANIZATION> focused on them, he said The action Friday was lauded by gun control advocates, but <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> LaPierre </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> NRA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Legislative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION>, said it was `` inconsistent with the rights guaranteed law-abiding American gun owners under the Second Amendment to the Constitution. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rifle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> will fight this decision in the courts, on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> and at the ballot box.'' <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Snyder </PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Citizens </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> for the Right to Keep and Bear Arms, said the ban `` shows the undependability of government, because originally, the <ORGANIZATION> ATF </ORGANIZATION> had certified that these rifles could be imported because they are suitable for sporting purposes. `` I think it also tends to further undermine whatever credibility President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has left with the firearms-owning community in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' he added. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, a hunter and a lifetime member of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rifle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, came into office opposing any bans on the assault-style weapons, despite an outcry over their increasing popularity among drug gangs and a heightened public concern triggered by the January schoolyard slayings of five children in <LOCATION> Stockton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, by a man wielding an AK-47. However, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> asked <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>, the director of the <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Policy </ORGANIZATION>, to advise him on what to do about the weapons. In March, at <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>'s urging, <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> suspended the imports of many of the weapons, and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> expanded the list the following month. The <ORGANIZATION> ATF </ORGANIZATION>, which has the power to control imports, does not regulate domestic manufacture of weapons, so similar weapons made in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would not be affected by the action. Several bills pending in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> would control or eliminate many of the U.S.-made assault-style weapons. The <ORGANIZATION> ATF </ORGANIZATION> has estimated that domestic makes account for three-quarters of the 3 million semiautomatic rifles now owned by Americans. <ORGANIZATION> Colt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> suspended sales of its AR-15, the most popular of the domestic assault semiautomatic rifles, in March. <PERSON> Sarah </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>, chairwoman of <ORGANIZATION> Handgun </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, praised the <ORGANIZATION> ATF </ORGANIZATION>'s action as <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s `` leadership in working toward reducing assault weapon violence by stopping the import of these weapons of war. `` I urge the president and the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to continue in the direction of public safety by passing legislation to stop the domestic production of assault weapons,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>, whose husband, former White House press secretary <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>, was severely wounded in the 1981 assassination attempt on President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. `` It is no more acceptable to have citizens being gunned down by killing machines wearing a ` Made in the <LOCATION> USA </LOCATION>' label than by those made abroad.'' Sen. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Metzenbaum </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ohio </LOCATION>, and Rep. <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Stark </PERSON>, D-Calif., who have authored bills that would severely limit or end future sales of domestically produced semiautomatic assault-style weapons as well as imports, echoed Mrs. <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>'s views `` The president's ban on imported assault weapons can not make our streets safer unless we also ban American-made assault weapons,'' said <PERSON> Metzenbaum </PERSON>. The senator said some domestic makes also `` are favored by drug dealers and street gangs and are used against police officers and innocent citizens.'' Said Stark: `` The president's decision to ban imported assault weapons while ignoring domestic ones is a glaring loophole.'' The <ORGANIZATION> NRA </ORGANIZATION> has argued vociferously against limits on the rights of law-abiding citizens to own the weapons and has urged a crackdown on criminals rather than imposition of new gun-control laws. The weapons banned come primarily from <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>. Others are made in <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>, among other countries.

 The government said Friday one soldier has been arrested and two are being sought in a widely publicized human rights case involving the killing of leftist <PERSON> Reynaldo </PERSON> <PERSON> Francisco </PERSON>. The announcement by <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Carpio </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investigation </ORGANIZATION>, was seen as an apparent bid to defuse criticism of President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>'s civil liberties record during her visit to <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 Several <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> prosecutors are eager to resurrect the state's old law banning abortions, in light of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>'s upholding <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>'s restrictions on the operation. `` I firmly believe that abortion is homicide and killing of an unborn fetus. If a crime has been committed, we will enforce the law as written here in <LOCATION> Rapides </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Parish </LOCATION>,'' District Attorney <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wagner </PERSON> said Friday. `` The statute's still on our books ... We intend to use that as a vehicle to get back in court,'' said <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Connick </PERSON>, district attorney in Orleans Parish. The state <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, in a resolution approved 81-13, asked prosecutors Thursday to enforce whatever pre-1973 abortion laws they consider constitutional. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> rewrote the resolution Friday to call for enforcement of a more recent law similar to the <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> law that forbids use of state money, workers or facilities for abortions. Federal courts ordered <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> in 1976 not to enforce its abortion law, which carried a penalty of up to 10 years in prison. However, it never was ruled unconstitutional, said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, a professor at <ORGANIZATION> Louisiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Wagner </PERSON> and other prosecutors said they would have to review Monday's decision before deciding whether to use <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> laws suspended after the 1973 <PERSON> Roe </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Wade </PERSON> decision that gave women a right to abortions. Some prosecutors were flatly dubious. `` I do n't think the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> has abrogated <PERSON> Wade </PERSON>,'' said <PERSON> Nathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Stansbury </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Lafayette </LOCATION>. `` I do n't think our general statute that says all abortions are prohibited is renewed by the <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> decision.'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, who argued the case as an assistant district attorney for <ORGANIZATION> Orleans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parish </ORGANIZATION>, said he and <PERSON> Connick </PERSON> have talked about bringing it back into federal district court but have not made a final decision. `` I told Mr. <PERSON> Connick </PERSON> that ... there seemed to be an invitation in -LRB- Monday's ruling -RRB- to raise the issue, and that this case might be a vehicle for doing so,'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said they probably will decide soon whether to ask the federal court to reconsider the case that prohibited abortion in <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>. Jefferson Parish District Attorney <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Mamoulides </PERSON> said his staff was drawing up a memo for the sheriff's office, outlining which parts of the old law might legally be enforced.

 Three F-16 jet engines that mysteriously disappeared from <ORGANIZATION> Hill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> earlier this week were found Friday, but their return was as murky as their leave-taking. The 3,200-pound engines, valued at about $ 2 million apiece, were recovered by the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>, but the bureau is n't talking. The engines `` are in the possession of the government,'' said <PERSON> Hill </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Len </PERSON> <PERSON> Barry </PERSON>. `` We can not discuss any details of the theft or recovery of those engines because the matter is still under investigation by the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> of Special Investigation,'' <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> Special Agent <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> Screen </PERSON> confirmed the engines had been located, but refused to provide further details. Retired Rear Adm. <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> La </PERSON> <PERSON> Rocque </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION>, a military think tank in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, said he knew of engine parts being stolen in the past. `` But ... whole jet engines, that just boggles my mind,'' he said Friday. `` I'd think it would be easier to steal a whole plane.'' <PERSON> La </PERSON> <PERSON> Rocque </PERSON> said millions of dollars have been lost through military employees stealing parts to sell, including many for a lucrative black market in spares for the F-14 fighter. The engines are rebuilt <ORGANIZATION> Pratt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Whitney </PERSON> F-100 TW200 series, about 17 feet long, 34 inches in diameter and weighing 3,200 pounds each. Earlier, <PERSON> Hill </PERSON> spokeswoman Maj. <PERSON> Portia </PERSON> <PERSON> McCracken </PERSON> said investigators had determined the engines were apparently taken off the base sometime between noon Saturday and noon Monday. She did not know if the engines belonged to <PERSON> Hill </PERSON> or if they had been sent from another base to be serviced. `` Nothing like this has ever happened in my memory. I would say that it is very unusual,'' <PERSON> McCracken </PERSON> said. The engines were discovered missing by maintenance crews returning to work Wednesday after the Independence Day holiday. Hill officials said the engines would have had to exit one of three gates on the base that are manned 24 hours a day with security guards. The F-16 is flown by pilots of the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>'s 388th Tactical Fighter Wing and the <ORGANIZATION> Utah </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> 419th </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tactical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fighter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wing </ORGANIZATION>, both based at <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> announced Friday that the first free-flight test of a so-called SLAM missile resulted in a direct hit last month at a <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> test site. The weapon, also known as a Standoff Land Attack Missile, is a derivative of the Harpoon missile system. It is designed to be fired from aircraft carrier-based planes and hit targets on land or ships at sea. A `` standoff'' weapon can be fired from some distance away from the target so that the plane carrying the weapon is not exposed to enemy fire. The SLAM missile makes use of an infrared system that sends a video image to the plane's pilot, who can select a specific area of the target. In a statement, the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> said the June 24 test was conducted at the <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Missile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Range </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. The missile was fired from a A-6E attack bomber and scored a `` direct hit'' on a simulated missile communication site, the statement said. Nine additional flights are schedule for the test program, the statement said. The missile, built by <ORGANIZATION> McDonnell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Missile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, is manufactured in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Charles </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo. </LOCATION>, the statement said.

 <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION>'s new military ruler said Friday that ousted Prime Minister <PERSON> Sadek </PERSON> <PERSON> el-Mahdi </PERSON> and 40 other arrested politicians will face military tribunals on charges of corruption. Lt. Gen. <PERSON> Omar </PERSON> <PERSON> Hassan </PERSON> <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON> <PERSON> el-Bashir </PERSON> said special military courts will be formed soon for the trials. `` I will only be gentle to an honest man,'' <PERSON> el-Bashir </PERSON> said in an interview with the <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government-funded <ORGANIZATION> Voice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>. The Associated Press was given access to the tape. `` Those politicians will wish they were being tried under <ORGANIZATION> Sharia </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- Islamic -RRB- laws,'' he said, indicating they will face tough trials. <PERSON> El-Mahdi </PERSON> escaped immediately after <PERSON> el-Bashir </PERSON>'s coup on June 30 but was arrested in a <LOCATION> Khartoum </LOCATION> suburb on Thursday. <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION>'s Islamic laws, passed in 1983, caused an outrcry in the West because of punishments that include cutting off limbs for theft, death by stoning for women who commit adultery and lashing for drinking alconol. The laws, currently suspended, are one of the main complaints of the rebel <ORGANIZATION> Sudan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, which has been fighting for six years for greater autonomy and political, economic and administrative reforms. <PERSON> El-Bashir </PERSON> has pledged to hold a national referendum on the laws if planned peace talks with the rebels in the <LOCATION> Ethiopian </LOCATION> capital <LOCATION> Addis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ababa </LOCATION> fail. <PERSON> El-Bashir </PERSON>, at the request of the Ethiopian government, postponed plans for sending a delegation to <LOCATION> Addis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ababa </LOCATION>, the official <ORGANIZATION> Sudan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> reported Friday.

<TEXT>
 An estimated 1,600 people are attacked annually at automated teller machines nationwide, and the near-fatal shooting of a woman forced to withdraw $ 400 proves ATM customers need more protection, an alderman said. <PERSON> Alderman </PERSON> <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Burke </PERSON> introduced a plan Thursday that would shut down ATMs between midnight and 6 a.m. It also would require a yearly, $ 200 city license and safety inspections of ATM locations by police. `` We can no longer wait to take action to make these areas safer for the residents of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Burke </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Burke </PERSON> said his restrictions might have prevented the assault on <PERSON> Dana </PERSON> <PERSON> Feitler </PERSON>, 24, who was accosted near her apartment on June 18, forced to withdraw $ 400 from a cash machine and then was shot in the head. She remains hospitalized in a coma. `` I see these machines that hand out cash to people standing on the street at any time of day or night and I know that they are inviting crime,'' said Police Superintendent <PERSON> LeRoy </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>, who is backing <PERSON> Burke </PERSON>'s plan. <PERSON> Clinton </PERSON> <PERSON> Krislov </PERSON>, a lawyer who filed a class-action lawsuit on behalf of bank customers following the <PERSON> Feitler </PERSON> shooting, has called for ATM safeguards, including more drive-through terminals to let customers stay in their cars, and secret `` panic'' numbers to alert police to a problem. `` Banks have security to protect machines from the customers,'' he said, but they do n't have adequate security for those customers. In Ms. <PERSON> Feitler </PERSON>'s case, a camera at the ATM where she was robbed took a picture only of her, but not her assailants, police have said. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>, an executive with the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, a professional organization, said Friday the machines are safe but people must use common sense. `` It takes an extra measure of thoughtfulness and care on the part of people using the machines at night and in remote areas,'' he said. Bank customers interviewed Friday said they'd feel shortchanged if ATM use was restricted. `` The fact that you can come and get your money anytime day or night, that's the whole point of having these automatic tellers,'' said <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Wells </PERSON>. `` They are a security problem,'' said <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Petran </PERSON>, an office worker. `` I can see where you're asking for trouble. But you have to be aware that that's life in the city.'' Hearings on the proposed ordinance are scheduled July 18 before the council's <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, which <PERSON> Burke </PERSON> chairs.

 Police killed three escaped convicts Friday, captured three others and rescued unharmed a 12-year-old hostage after a bus hijacking and chase through remote northeastern <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>, officials reported.

He said they then stopped a bus carrying about 40 passengers and ordered the driver to head for <PERSON> Conceicao </PERSON> do Coite, a city of about 60,000 lying about 1,180 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION>. There, scores of police surrounded the bus and exchanged gunfire with the hijackers. Three passengers were slightly injured, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferreira </PERSON> of the mayor's office at Conceicao do Coite said by telephone. Before dawn Friday, the hijackers took several hostages from the bus and fled in a car provided by local authorities. Outside of town they released all hostages except a 12-year-old boy, then abandoned the car and fled on foot through the brush, <PERSON> Ferreira </PERSON> said. Early Friday, police surrounded a peasant's cottage where the fugitives had holed up with their hostage and killed three of the escapers and seized the other three, mayoral aide <PERSON> Ferreira </PERSON> said. `` They wanted to hide in the outback, but a lot of peasants live in the region and it was easy for the police to find them,'' he added.

<HEAD>China's Growth Rate Slows, Government Gives Mixed Reports</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s industrial production grew much more slowly in the first half of 1989 than in 1988, according to figures released Friday, but the government seemed unsure whether that was good or not. From an economic standpoint, the news was good: <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> has been trying since last fall to slow what it called overheated industrial growth that was fueling inflation and shortages. But since quelling nationwide pro-democracy protests last month, the government has sought for political reasons to show that factories are operating normally and production is climbing. News media have been filled with reports of improved production nationwide. Total industrial output from January through June was $ 172.9 billion, up 10.8 percent over the same period last year, the official <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said, quoting the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Statistics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION>. By comparison, industrial output in the first half of 1988 grew 17.2 percent over the same period one year earlier. This year, the government set target of gradually declining growth rates, beginning with below 16 percent in the first quarter and below 13 percent in the second. The goal for the year is a 10 increase in production over 1988. <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> might well have reported that the nation overfulfilled its target for controlling too-rapid growth. Instead, it focused on industrial production's having grown `` steadily.'' Another Xinhua dispatch said <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s leading industrial city, topped its production quota for the first half of the year. The news agency said <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION>'s industrial output was $ 13.9 billion up 9 percent from last year. It said the growth `` was achieved in the face of shortages of energy, funds and raw materials during the turmoil which lasted nearly two months in the city.''

 Adm. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Crowe </PERSON>, retiring head of the <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chiefs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Staff </ORGANIZATION>, said Friday that his historic 11-day visit to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> revealed the superpowers are entering a period of `` uneasy transition'' that `` does not ... make me feel comfortable.'' <PERSON> Crowe </PERSON>, in a speech before the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>, said he hopes the two military giants are moving toward a new era in the superpower relationship, but `` to conclude that we are already there would be a serious mistake.'' The 64-year-old admiral, speaking a day after President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> rejected a new call from Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> for talks to eliminate short-range nuclear missiles in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, said he believes <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> should avoid `` dramatic counter-responses'' to <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> initiatives `` at this point.'' <PERSON> Crowe </PERSON> met for more than an hour with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> two weeks ago in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> during his precedent-setting tour of once-secret Soviet military installations and visits with Soviet military officers. It was the first formal visit of a Joint Chiefs chairman to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and was the latest in a series of high-level visits designed to dispel distrust between the superpowers. Last July, <PERSON> Crowe </PERSON> hosted Marshal <PERSON> Sergei </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Akhromeyev </PERSON>, then the Soviet chief of staff, on a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> visit. `` There is little question in my mind that real change is afoot in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Crowe </PERSON> said, adding that he believed that <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and his supporters were committed to `` fundamental reform.'' <PERSON> Crowe </PERSON> said that while there are encouraging signs that <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s reforms and promised military cutbacks may help move away from the confrontational legacy of the postwar era, the Soviet changes `` have yet to be translated into reality.'' `` Our systems remain fundamentally competitive,'' he said. The Soviets still retain the world's largest military force and have made no major changes in their space, air defense or strategic weapons, he said. The admiral lauded the Soviet military officers he met as `` disciplined, well-trained and motivated'' and found their equipment to be `` impressive and capable in the field.'' He termed political and social changes the Soviets have initiated as `` immense and risky.'' <PERSON> Crowe </PERSON> said he believed the Soviets do n't always understand the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and `` do n't appreciate why we do n't respond move-for-move'' and `` sometimes interpret this phenomenon as threatening to them.'' `` All of this does not give me a warm, fuzzy feeling, nor make me comfortable,'' <PERSON> Crowe </PERSON> said. `` What can be said is that we are entering a period of uneasy transition and hopefully we are moving toward a new era in the superpower relationship.'' The admiral said the Soviets are attempting to `` shed their past'' and `` do n't appreciate why our historical realtionship still weighs heavily in our decisions.'' Therefore, <PERSON> Crowe </PERSON> argued, the two superpowers `` may be in this unsettled state for a long period of time.'' `` My deepest concern is that our own impatience does n't force us to move too far before we understand where the world is headed,'' <PERSON> Crowe </PERSON> said. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> must `` move gradually and deliberately in reasonable steps as the horizon becomes clearer _ not before,'' he added. The military chief announced on Sunday that he will retire on Sept. 30 at the end of his second two-year term as chairman.

 Americans took out $ 3.6 billion more in consumer debt than they retired in May as the pace of borrowing turned upward again, the government reported Friday. The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> said consumer credit in May rose at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 6.2 percent, up from the 4.3 percent pace of the previous month. Still, it was a smaller rise than increases of 6.6 percent in March and 9.5 percent in February. Consumer credit had increased 8.5 percent over all of 1988. Consumer spending is closely watched as a barometer of the economy's health since it represents two-thirds of overall economic activity. <PERSON> Cynthia </PERSON> <PERSON> Latta </PERSON>, an economist with <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, in <LOCATION> Lexington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, said the report suggests consumer confidence. `` Consumers are still adding to their debt,'' she said. `` When they really get worried, they retrench and start paying down.'' Interest rates, she said, do not have as much influence on consumer credit as with other types of loans. `` Revolving credit rates hardly move at all, and auto rates only a percent or so,'' she said. This type of consumer `` is more concerned with the amount of the monthly payments, not the amount of interest.'' Until the spring, interest rates had been rising as the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> tightened its grip on credit in its attempt to stem inflation. Since early last month however, the central bank has loosened its grip and interest rates have declined somewhat. Leading the overall consumer credit increase in May was the category of debt that includes credit cards. It rose $ 1.94 billion, a 12.6 percent annual rate of growth, after a 10.9 percent increase in April. Auto loans were up $ 1.02 billion May, a 4.2 percent increase on an annual basis compared to a 2.8 percent rise in April, the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> reported. Auto loans had gone up only 0.3 percent in March. Bank and credit union loans not secured by real estate increased by $ 659 million in May, a 4 percent annual rate of advance, up from 2 percent in April. Borrowing for mobile homes fell for the fourth consecutive month, declining by $ 15 million at an annual rate of 0.7 percent. That followed drops of 8.7 percent in April and 84.2 percent in March. The steep March drop occurred largely becasue of a shift in debt from the mobile home category into that of bank loans. The various changes left total consumer debt in May at a seasonally adjusted $ 697.26 billion.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> will purchase $ 15 million worth of apples in an effort to help reduce a huge surplus created when consumers stopped buying amid fears over use of the chemical Alar, the department said Friday. The industry has estimated that 5 million to 7 million boxes of apples from last year's crop, valued at between $ 40 million and $ 56 million, remain unsold. The department said apple stocks were 53 percent greater on May 31 than the average for that date for the previous three years, and prices to growers had fallen by $ 3 to $ 4 per carton from what they were a year ago. The top grade of red apples produced in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state were recently selling for between $ 7.50 and $ 8 per box, about $ 2 below the cost of production. The nation's 20,000 apple growers have estimated losses at well over $ 100 million in sales. Alar is used to enchance red color, to ease harvesting by delaying ripening so that most apples ripen together and to lengthen shelf and storage life. The chemical penetrates throughout the fruit tissue and can not be washed off like many pesticides. The Alar controversy began in late February when a private environmental advocacy group, the <ORGANIZATION> Natural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, said apples treated with the chemical substantially increase the risk of cancer in children. In cooperation with the department, the industry will release apples to schools, prisons, food aid programs and others. `` By removing these apples from normal channels of trade, the apple market will be helped immediately and stocks should be cleared out before the beginning of the 1989 season,'' said a department statement attributed to <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Clayton </PERSON>, acting administrator of the department's <ORGANIZATION> Agricultureal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marketing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. `` This is a major purchase,'' said Republican Rep. <PERSON> Sid </PERSON> <PERSON> Morrison </PERSON>, whose central <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> district produces roughly half of the nation's apples. <PERSON> Morrison </PERSON> said the `` Alar scare has been a form of nutritional terrorism that has unfairly dropped an economic bombshell on apple growers.'' Though the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> disputed the environmental group's report as a major exaggeration of the risk, sales fell immediately. Supermarkets began frequent posting of signs proclaiming their apples as Alar-free, and reducing prices on the red delicious variety on which Alar frequently had been used. Even though <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> criticized the <ORGANIZATION> Natural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> report, the agency plans to ban use of Alar and the manufacturer has withdrawn it from the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> market.

 The nation's unemployment rate climbed slightly to 5.3 percent last month as continued declines in manufacturing and construction slowed overall job growth, the government said Friday in providing fresh evidence of a slowing economy. Analysts were split on whether the jobless data provided by the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> suggested a recession was nearing, but they were unanimous in saying there was nothing in the report to change the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION>'s apparent decision to ease monetary policy. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> has apparently shifted gears now and it views the risk of a recession as more pronounced than the risk of inflation,'' <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> analyst <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> said. Wall Street's initial reaction was indifferent but a broad advance came later as analysts interpreted the report as an encouragement for the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> to relax credit and thus as a possible harbinger of lower interest rates. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials climbed 25.42 points to 2,487.86, its fourth consecutive gain. The increase in the civilian jobless rate from 5.2 percent in May to 5.3 percent last month was not unexpected; most economists had predicted the rate would hold steady or edge up a notch. More attention was focused on the department's report that non-farm businesses added just 180,000 jobs last month after a revised payroll expansion of 207,000 jobs in May. For the past four months businesses added an average of just below 200,000 jobs a month, well below the nearly 300,000 average monthly gains posted in 1988. Virtually all of the June growth came in the service sector, with the goods-producing sectors of manufacturing and construction posting declines of 31,000 and 8,000 jobs, respectively. `` This is certainly consistent with the picture that the economy is growing at a slower rate than it has been, with a real weakness in the goods-producing industries _ where you would expect the impact of high interest rates to be most severe,'' said <PERSON> Pierre </PERSON> <PERSON> Ellis </PERSON>, a senior economist with <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advisers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. Those higher interest rates are attributed to the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>'s more than yearlong campaign to slow growth by holding tight on credit, an effort which appears to have given way in recent weeks to an easing of monetary The campaign has produced the slower rate of economic growth the central bank desired. But <PERSON> Ellis </PERSON> and other analysts said it was troubling that the burden for the slowdown to date has been borne almost solely in the goods-producing industries, because declines in those areas generally occur prior to a recession. <PERSON> Ellis </PERSON> predicted a recession in early 1990; <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> has said one is likely in the second half of this year. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>, head of a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> forecasting firm, disputed those estimates and said continued monthly job growth in the 200,000 range would allow the economy to slow without toppling into recession. In another sure indicator of slowing economic growth, the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said the average factory workweek slipped slipped 0.1 of an hour to 40.9 hours last month, the first time this indicator has fallen below 41 hours since September 1987. There was a bit of encouraging news regarding inflation _ the department reported average hourly earnings of production and supervisory workers were essentially unchanged. For the first five months of the year, hourly wages had grown on average by 0.3 percent. But analysts cautioned against reading too much into the month-to-month figures because the number often vary over a period of just a few months. The payroll numbers are taken from the department's monthly survey of business establishments. Data from a separate household survey, used to set the unemployment rate, found that the civilian labor force grew by 492,000 people from May to June, to a total of 124.1 million. That increase came after a reported decline in the labor force in May and likely was influenced by summer entrants into the job market. Of the civilian labor force, 117.5 million held jobs and 6.5 million were looking for work but could not find it, the government said. Among most demographic groups the unemployment rate was unchanged or up just slightly. But increases in joblessness were reported for teen-agers in general and black female teen-agers in particular. The rate for the latter group shot up from 28 percent in May to more than 40 percent last month. Among all teen-agers the unemployment rate rose from 15.2 percent to 15.6 percent. That came as the labor force for that age group grew by more than 100,000, apparently due to an influx of students into the labor market. The government said blacks made up the bulk of the new teen-agers in the labor force. In contrast to young black women, male black teen-agers had some success in finding jobs as their unemployment rate fell more than 3 percentage points to a still-high 33.5 percent. The civilian jobless rate has been hovering in the 5 percent range for more than a year. It was 5.4 percent in June 1988 and fell to a more than 15-year low of 5.0 percent in March before heading upward. Most analysts believe it will climb to 5.5 percent or higher by year's end.

 Federal trade sanctions that stalled the delivery of three <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> jetliners to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> last month have been lifted, a <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said Friday. Three 757-200s valued at $ 150 million will be delivered as soon as possible, said <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commercial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airplanes </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Randy </PERSON> <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON>. The planes were to be delivered in June but were held up when the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Munitions </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> suspended the export licenses for crucial navigational components in the aircraft, department spokesman <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Bailes </PERSON> has said. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> halted all sales of military equipment to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> following the killing of hundreds of pro-democracy demonstrators in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> on June 4. The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> on Friday lifted the suspensions on the three planes and on one other plane that is scheduled for delivery later this month, <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON> said. `` As far as I know, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> has reviewed the suspensions and decided that these items are not part of the original intent of the presidential trade sanctions,'' <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Harter </PERSON> said the suspension order was lifted for <ORGANIZATION> Honeywell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> navigational systems used in the <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> planes. The navigational systems are on the controlled <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> munitions list. `` Our decision is in keeping with the president's intent not to disrupt non-military commercial trade with the Peoples Republic of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and was based on the fact that these navigational systems are designed for inclusion in civilian products and are critical to the safe operation of commercial aircraft,'' <PERSON> Harter </PERSON> said. `` To have denied these exports would have jeopardized the safety of civilian airline passengers traveling in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Harter </PERSON> said the order also authorizes <ORGANIZATION> Honeywell </ORGANIZATION> to repair and replace defective navational systems in civilian Chinese aircraft. Original dates of delivery of two aircraft to <ORGANIZATION> Guangzhou </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> were June 12 and June 22. The due date for one airplane for <ORGANIZATION> Shanghai </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> was June 17, <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON> said. The planes have a two-class seating configuration for between 176 and 180 passengers, <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON> said. He did not know when actual delivery would take place. The <ORGANIZATION> Chinese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corporation </ORGANIZATION> system already operates five 757-200s, <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON> said. The Chinese government has purchased 61 <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> airplanes of all models since 1971, with a total value of $ 2.35 billion. The Chinese government is still awaiting delivery of another seven aircraft. The 11-plane deal is valued at $ 650 million, <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON> said.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southeast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Asian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> is in town for it 22nd meeting and the streets are bedecked with bunting, so why do the decorations feature the number 43 instead of 22? Because the bunting is n't for the delegates; it's for the sultan, who turns 43 on July 15. The sultan, who has 37 words in his name and title, is worth $ 30 billion and takes very good care of the 241,000 people over whom he has absolute sway. He is <PERSON> Duli </PERSON> <PERSON> Yang </PERSON> <PERSON> Maha </PERSON> <PERSON> Mulia </PERSON> <PERSON> Paduka </PERSON> <PERSON> Seri </PERSON> <PERSON> Baginda </PERSON> <PERSON> Sultan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Yang </PERSON> <PERSON> Di-Pertuan </PERSON> <PERSON> Negeri </PERSON> <PERSON> Brunei </PERSON> <PERSON> Awang </PERSON> <PERSON> Muda </PERSON> <PERSON> Hassanal </PERSON> <PERSON> Bolkiah </PERSON> <PERSON> Mu'issaddin </PERSON> <PERSON> Waddaulah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ibni </PERSON> <PERSON> Duli </PERSON> <PERSON> Yang </PERSON> <PERSON> Teramat </PERSON> <PERSON> Mulia </PERSON> <PERSON> Paduka </PERSON> <PERSON> Seri </PERSON> <PERSON> Begawan </PERSON> <PERSON> Sultan </PERSON> <PERSON> Awang </PERSON> <PERSON> Muda </PERSON> <PERSON> Omar </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Aifuddin </PERSON> <PERSON> Saifuddin </PERSON> <PERSON> Sa'adul </PERSON> <PERSON> Khairi </PERSON> <PERSON> Waddin </PERSON>. Most people just call him Sir <PERSON> Hassanal </PERSON> <PERSON> Bolkiah </PERSON>. His sultanate, 2,226 square miles on the north coast of <LOCATION> Borneo </LOCATION>, sits on a huge pool of oil and natural gas. The Guinness Book of World Records says Sir <PERSON> Hassanal </PERSON> is the world's richest individual becauwe oil income and foreign currency reserves totaling almost $ 30 billion are `` effectively at his disposal.'' Fortune magazine confirmed his enormous wealth and said King Fahd of <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> was second with $ 18 billion. Secular, religious and military power rest with the sultan, a hereditary ruler who is head of state, prime minister, defense minister and commander of the armed forces. One of his brothers is in charge of foreign affairs and another heads the <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> of this former British protectorate, which became fully independent five years ago. As well as being the richest person in the world, Sir <PERSON> Hassanal </PERSON> lives with his relatives in the world's biggest palace _ a complex of buildings built with 38 types of marble on a 300-acre hill near the <LOCATION> Brunei </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>. In case friends decide to stay over, it has 1,778 rooms and 257 toilets. There are 564 chandeliers, 18 elevators, 44 staircases and a banquet hall that seats 4,000. His majesty's polo ponies have air-conditioned quarters. More than 2,000 workers completed the Istana -LRB- palace -RRB- <PERSON> Nurul </PERSON> <PERSON> Imam </PERSON> for independence in 1984 and the sultan never said how much it cost. Guesses at the time started at $ 250 million, but suppliers who know what went into it _ including 22-carat gold tiles on interior arches _ say at least $ 600 million. The sultan has two wives. He was married first to Her Majesty the <PERSON> Raja </PERSON> <PERSON> Isteri </PERSON> <PERSON> Pengiran </PERSON> <PERSON> Anak </PERSON> <PERSON> Saleha </PERSON> and then to Her Royal <PERSON> Highness </PERSON> <PERSON> Pengiran </PERSON> <PERSON> Isteri </PERSON> <PERSON> Hajjah </PERSON> <PERSON> Mariam </PERSON>. He has three sons and six daughters. <PERSON> Saleha </PERSON>, the sultan's first cousin, resides in the Nurul Imam. Mariam -LRB- born <LOCATION> Mariam </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bell </LOCATION> -RRB- keeps house in a smaller and newer palace, <LOCATION> Nurulizza </LOCATION>, 14 miles from the capital. Their marriage caused a rift between the sultan and his father, Sir <PERSON> Omar </PERSON>, because she was a commoner and part Japanese. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> occupied <LOCATION> Brunei </LOCATION> during World War II. The sultan met Mariam when she was a hostess on the <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brunei </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>. The royal family, in power for 29 generations, ensures continued support for autocracy by providing subsidized food, fuel, housing and free education and medical care. There is no personal income tax. Shortly after independence, Sir <PERSON> Hassanal </PERSON> was quoted as saying his subjects enjoyed `` a good life. Why should they want more?'' Bruneians seem content. The happiest probably are the civil servants, who make up 46 percent of the work force of 85,000. Along with standard benefits, they get free pensions and interest-free loans to buy cars and houses. Traffic jams are common in <LOCATION> Brunei </LOCATION>, which has one car for every 2.3 people. Prince <PERSON> Mohamed </PERSON> <PERSON> Bolkiah </PERSON>, the foreign minister, told reporters covering the conference: `` The people seem to be very happy with the way we are running things. The people accept it.'' They certainly are spared worries that trouble the foreigners here assembled. There is no national debt, no trade deficit, no balance of payments problem and the budget always shows a surplus. Oil and natural gas account for 99 percent of exports. Sir <PERSON> Hassanal </PERSON> was attending <ORGANIZATION> Sandhurst </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Military </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> when his father abdicated in 1967 and he was summoned home at age 21 to take the throne. <PERSON> Sultan </PERSON> <PERSON> Omar </PERSON> continued to run things from behind the scenes for another 15 years, however, and the polo-playing young potentate took the opportunity to build an international reputation as a playboy. <LOCATION> Brunei </LOCATION>'s last flirtation with an elected parliament was in 1962, when it was still a British protectorate. The Parti Rakyat <LOCATION> Brunei </LOCATION>, since outlawed, won all 16 seats on the <ORGANIZATION> Legislative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Sultan </PERSON> <PERSON> Omar </PERSON> refused to convene the council and an uprising ensued. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> crushed the rebellion and a state of emergency declared at the time remains in force.

<HEAD>1804 Silver Dollar Auctioned for Record Price of Nearly $1 Million</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 An 1804 silver dollar, one of the most prized coins known to collectors, was sold at auction Friday for $ 990,000, the highest amount ever bid for a coin. <PERSON> Hugh </PERSON> <PERSON> Sconyers </PERSON>, of the American Rare Coin Fund in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, purchased the 1804 silver dollar for $ 900,000 and the 10 percent auction fee at the Auction'89 sale at the Hyatt Regency <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. He called the purchase a `` cut and dried business decision.'' `` It's perhaps one of the most famous coins in all of numismatics and our fund feels that it reprsents a good long-term value,'' <PERSON> Sconyers </PERSON> said after the record purchase. The most ever paid for any coin at auction was $ 725,000 for a 1793 colonial <PERSON> Brasher </PERSON> doubloon in 1979. The current auction record for a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> coin is $ 625,000, paid in 1982 for an 1870s $ 5 gold piece. The 1804 dollar is one of only 15 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> silver dollars bearing that date, although none actually was minted in 1804. During the 1830s, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> leaders needed gifts to be given to foreign governments by ambassadors, so mint workers retrieved an unused 1803 dollar die and changed the date to 1804. Only 15 such coins were struck during the next 30 years. Seven of the 1804 dollars are in museums and individual collectors hold the remaining eight. The coin sold at auction Friday belonged to <PERSON> Leon </PERSON> <PERSON> Hendrickson </PERSON>, co-owner of <PERSON> SilverTowne </PERSON>, a rare coin and precious metals dealer in <LOCATION> Winchester </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ind </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Hendrickson </PERSON> said he bought the coin for $ 500,000 four years ago from <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Vogt </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>. `` I bugged him for a few years to sell it, and he finally did,'' he said. `` It's the king of the coins,'' said the 62-year-old <PERSON> Hendrickson </PERSON>, who began collecting coins during the 1940s. <PERSON> Hendrickson </PERSON> said he decided to sell the silver dollar after having open-heart surgery last year. `` I'm really going to be sad in lots of ways, glad in other ways,'' he said. `` I think it's kind of like maybe when you have a daughter get married, something like that. You're glad and happy and sad, too, to see them leave home.''

 A suspicious fire broke out briefly Friday night in the mid-rise office building where a blaze last week killed five people, but authorities said no serious injuries were reported in the second fire. `` We suspect arson at this time,'' said acting Fire Chief <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahle </PERSON>, after firefighters extinguished the fire that broke out shortly before 9 p.m. in a fourth-floor women's rest room.

After Friday night's blaze, <ORGANIZATION> Mahle </ORGANIZATION> said, an arson investigator took samples of a couch where the second fire apparently started. The building had been reopened to the public only hours earlier, at 2:30 p.m., <ORGANIZATION> Mahle </ORGANIZATION> said, and only six maintenance workers were inside when the fire began. On June 30, more than 30 people were injured after a fire broke out on the fourth floor. Four people died of smoke inhalation in that blaze, apparently triggered by an explosion that killed an electrician changing a fuse.

 About 60 million Americans 20 and older _ more than one-third of the nation's adults _ face the risk of coronary disease because they have high blood cholesterol levels, a study has found. `` What's especially disconcerting is that high cholesterol levels are often seen in association with other risk factors _ hypertension, smoking, or being overweight,'' says <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Sempos </PERSON>, one of eight authors of the study published in today's Journal of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> `` And for many people, most of the desired changes could be achieved through a change in routines like diet and exercise,'' Sempos, a nutritionist and epidemiologist with the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Statistics </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Hyattsville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, said in a telephone interview Thursday. `` Even though we've made great strides in alerting the public to the dangers of cholesterol and heart disease, there's still too large a segment that is putting itself unnecessarily at risk.''

It fails to evangelize _ make converts _ among blacks because it does n't train anyone to do so, he said, adding that other religions are filling the gap.

 The vast majority of assault weapons barred from importation since spring will be banned permanently from this country, the government announced Friday. The ban imposed on 43 styles of semiautomatic weapons _ including the popular Chinese-made AK-47 and Israeli-made <PERSON> Uzi </PERSON> carbine _ followed a four-month study by the <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alcohol </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tobacco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Firearms </ORGANIZATION> on whether the weapons met the standards imposed by the Gun Control Act of 1968, which barred importation of weapons that are not used for legitimate sporting purposes. `` The study was undertaken because of the dramatic increase in the number of these weapons being imported and police reports of their use in violent crime,'' said <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> ATF </ORGANIZATION> bureau. While the 43 were banned permanently, another seven whose imports had been suspended since early spring will be available for import again as a result of the study. Those include six .22 rimfire caliber rifles and a gun called the <ORGANIZATION> Valmet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hunter </ORGANIZATION>, which had been considered an AK-47 type of weapon during the suspension.

<HEAD>Lameduck Pinochet Trying to Build Power Base in Chile</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Gen. <PERSON> Augusto </PERSON> <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> is using his lame-duck presidency to make influential political and judicial appointments expected to endure long after a civilian successor is elected in December. Opposition politicians and jurists expect <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>'s apparent efforts to build a lasting base of power for the future will largely fail, but they concede that, with the 60,000-man army behind him, the right-wing general could yet pose a formidible obstacle to the transition to civilian government. <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> has said he wo n't be a candidate in the election but plans to remain army commander after he gives up the presidency he seized in the 1973 coup that overthrew <PERSON> Salvador </PERSON> <PERSON> Allende </PERSON>, a Marxist. Under a constitution his adminstration crafted, <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> and the chiefs of the other armed forces are legally entitled to their commands until 1998. <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> recently said he does not plan to be subordinate to the new civilian president and speaks of `` a kind of co-habitation'' with him. In an evident bid to preserve enough influence for such a relationship, however, his administration has begun renewing its appointments of loyal followers at the local and national level, from town halls to the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. Once designated, they can not easily be replaced even after the change of government. The renewal began within weeks of <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>'s resounding referendum defeat in October, when voters rejected a military proposal that he remain president until 1997. The loss obliged <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> to schedule presidential and congressional elections for Dec. 14. The new government begins a four-year term on March 11. One of <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>'s most powerful aides, Gen. <PERSON> Patricio </PERSON> <PERSON> Serre </PERSON>, the subsecretary for regional development, has been overseeing the sytematic replacement of 319 apppointed mayors nationwide. Their terms are for four years, and they will wield extensive powers of patronage and local spending. Many of those being replaced, including some retired military officers, have announced plans to run for <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> as a kind of pro-Pinochet bloc. In an effort to revamp the 17-man <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, the government recently made a unique 90-day offer to 10 justices more than 75 years old of special pension benefits the equivalent of $ 53,000 in a windfall payout each, to be added to regular monthly pension of about $ 900. It is an extraordinary sum by Chilean standards. The 10 justices face automatic retirement when the new government comes in. To get the pension they have to step down by mid-September, which would give <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>'s adminstration time to appoint successors. Justices serve five-year terms and have authority that extends far beyond simple questions of law. The court, for example, designates three members of a seven-member <ORGANIZATION> Constitutional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tribunal </ORGANIZATION> that has final word on constitutional questions and four of the national election board's five members. The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> president is one of the influential <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>'s eight members. The government also has accelerated its program for privatizing many of the industries that remain in state hands and plans a law that will make the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> largely autonomous, with the new president unable to replace its director and other key officers. Critics have denounced the measure as a bid to deprive the new government of control over economic policy. Nonetheless, the opposition contends that <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>'s efforts will sink in a sea of political change after the election. They point to opinion polls indicating that presidential candidate <PERSON> Patricio </PERSON> <PERSON> Aylwin </PERSON>, a Christian Democrat backed by a united center-left opposition, has a nearly insurmountable lead. <PERSON> Jorge </PERSON> <PERSON> Schaulsohn </PERSON>, a leader of the left-of-center <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democracy </ORGANIZATION>, said in an interview, he expected the last-minute appointees to shift sympathies, or at least show themselves to be flexible, when the new government takes over. `` In a democratic environment, it does n't matter who appointed you,'' he said. `` I'm sure you'll be smart enough to understand that you have to adapt to what the country wants. This happens everywhere.'' In addition, <PERSON> Aylwin </PERSON> has said his priority will be a plan to `` democratize'' the country's municipal system and hold elections to replace appointed mayors. <PERSON> Schaulsohn </PERSON> acknowledged, however, that <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>'s grip on the army commander's post `` poses a danger.'' He said the opposition planned a campaign to persuade the armed forces that it was not in their or the country's interests to have <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> remain army chief. <PERSON> Schaulsohn </PERSON> said he suspected <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> `` is trying to negotiate some kind of immunity'' for himself and his troops, some of whom are accused of human rights violations including illegal arrest, torture and execution. <PERSON> Francisco </PERSON> <PERSON> Cumplido </PERSON>, a constitutional expert and member of the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, said human rights would be one of the thorniest issues in the transition. More than 700 people disappeared and thousands were arrested, tortured or sent into exile in a wave of anti-leftist repression after the 1973 coup. In recent years, atrocities have declined significantly but some repression of dissidents continues, human rights groups say. <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> recently said he was considering a general amnesty for security forces members who might face prosecution in `` little cases'' of human rights abuse.

 $ 85 Toll Too Much for Users of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s New Inland Sea Bridge

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> built a high-technology wonder of a bridge to bring a small island into the modern era, but local residents and industries say they ca n't afford its $ 85 round-trip toll. The six-mile <LOCATION> Seto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Inland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bridge </LOCATION>, which opened a year ago to connect <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Honshu </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> with <ORGANIZATION> Shikoku </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Island </ORGANIZATION>, was the final ground link in a long-held dream to connect <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s four main islands. But the $ 85 toll, set to offset the $ 7.79 billion cost of the bridge, does n't entice many motorists or truckers. Excitement and local pride built to a fever pitch at the opening of the bridge in April 1988, because it meant <ORGANIZATION> Shikoku </ORGANIZATION>'s 4.2 million people would have a link to <LOCATION> Honshu </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s largest island. During 10 years of construction, they viewed the double-tiered network of six bridges and connecting viaducts as a rite of passage into <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s modern era. Residents on both sides of the <LOCATION> Seto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Inland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> believe, however, the bridge has given the region a psychological boost. `` Before the bridge, the <LOCATION> Seto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Inland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> divided the cultures of the islands, and isolated <ORGANIZATION> Shikoku </ORGANIZATION>,'' said <PERSON> Teruo </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamaie </PERSON>, a newscaster on the TV network <ORGANIZATION> RSK </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Okayama </LOCATION>, a city of 600,000 people on <LOCATION> Honshu </LOCATION>. `` But now the two peoples feel integrated.'' While the bridge has increased tourism _ it has become a curiosity _ it has brought little concrete benefit to <ORGANIZATION> Shikoku </ORGANIZATION>'s industrial quarter Local fisheries and produce growers looked forward to the bridge because it would mean they no longer would have to rely on ferry boats, often subject to the area's unpredictable weather, for deliveries. But they say their delivery trucks continue to use the ferries. Although ferry tolls are also high _ about $ 95 one way for the 90-mile trip from <ORGANIZATION> Shikoku </ORGANIZATION> to the port of <LOCATION> Kobe </LOCATION> _ regular users get up to 40 percent discounts, and save on the bridge toll, gasoline, and tolls for new highways on the <LOCATION> Honshu </LOCATION> side of the bridge. The companies say they save money by transporting their goods by sea as far as possible, and their drivers get a chance to rest. <PERSON> Katsushige </PERSON> <PERSON> Matsuda </PERSON>, manager of the <ORGANIZATION> Kagawa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fishery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cooperatives </ORGANIZATION>, said that on bad days, his trucks will wait for hours for fog to lift rather than use the bridge. When <ORGANIZATION> Shikoku </ORGANIZATION>'s new Takamatsu airport is completed this year, the cooperative will invest in air delivery service rather than use the bridge. `` We ca n't say that the bridge has had any merit for the fishing industry,'' <PERSON> Matsuda </PERSON> said. The high bridge toll also has kept regular motorists off the bridge as well. Less than half the expected daily traffic was recorded in the first year of the bridge's operation. An average of 10,800 vehicles crossed every day, and projected revenues fell short by $ 137 million. But railway traffic during the period was higher than expected. For about $ 2.70 a ticket, about 30,000 passengers rode the <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> Railways trains that speed across the bridge's lower deck 144 times a day in both directions. The area's tourist industry has benefited from the bridge, however. More than twice as many tourists as in 1987 flocked to <ORGANIZATION> Shikoku </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Kagawa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Prefecture </LOCATION> last year, most of them drawn by the bridge itself. In the process, they booked 5,000 more hotel rooms than the year before and consumed thousands of tons of udon noodles, a local specialty. In the town of <LOCATION> Sakaide </LOCATION> on <ORGANIZATION> Shikoku </ORGANIZATION>, a 520-foot tower for viewing the <LOCATION> Seto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Inland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> and the bridge was built for the new flow of tourists. Across the island-studded sea in <LOCATION> Okayama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Prefecture </LOCATION>, a major tourism makeover is taking shape. The city of Uno, a down-at-the-heel port since the decline of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s shipbuilding industry, is the site of a $ 137 million `` <LOCATION> Spanish </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Village </LOCATION>,'' a vast amusement and marine park to open in 1992. `` Century Park Tivoli,'' a $ 343.5 million amusement center based on one in <LOCATION> Copenhagen </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION>, is expected to open in 1994. `` These projects would n't have come to this region without the interest generated by the bridge,'' said <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, an American who is the coordinator of international relations in <LOCATION> Okayama </LOCATION>'s commerce and industry department `` There is a sense that 1988 was n't the big year in <LOCATION> Okayama </LOCATION>, that there is more to come.''

 Young descendants of immigrants who crossed the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> in years past to work in the fields and factories of <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> are taking the journey in reverse nowadays as the nation sinks deep into recession. `` This is my home and I hope to return to it and live and die here, but not if it means starving to death because I do n't have any work,'' <PERSON> Aldo </PERSON> <PERSON> Bignone </PERSON>, a 23-year-old auto mechanic, said as he stood outside the Spanish Consulate to apply for a visa. <PERSON> Rodrigo </PERSON> <PERSON> Imas </PERSON>, a 30-year-old print shop employee, said his grandfather told him many times about the four-week trip he made from <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> in the hold of a freighter to start a new life in <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>. `` Now I'm hoping to find enough money to buy a one-way ticket on <ORGANIZATION> Aerolineas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Argentinas </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Imas </PERSON> said. `` The transportation has changed and the direction is reversed, but the idea is the same.'' As inflation and interest rates have soared out of control and the austral currency falls to a tiny fraction of its worth just five months ago, businesses have closed by the score and thousands of workers have been laid off. Argentines who consider themselves lucky just to have jobs have watched in dismay as food, gasoline, cigarettes, movie tickets and virtually everything else have shot up in price, while wages in real terms have shrunk. Argentines have left for years for a variety of reasons. A decade ago, it was to escape the violence of left-wing subversion followed by a brutal crackdown that began with a military coup in March 1976. For the past several years, Argentines have left in search of economic opportunity, however, and visa applications have accelerated as the economy has deteriorated in recent months. With the austral trading at about 590 to the dollar, a teacher who earned $ 100 a month at the end of 1988 now might be earning a little as $ 40; a newspaper reporter who earned $ 300 now earns $ 90; a bilingual marketing administrator could well have seen his pay fall from $ 300 to $ 135 and a bank economist from $ 700 to $ 300. `` A lot of people are thinking that their children have limited futures,'' said the Canadian consul, <PERSON> Andree </PERSON> <PERSON> Bazinet </PERSON>. `` They get all these skills at the university and ca n't use them in <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>. We get some of our highest quality acceptances from <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>.'' In 1986, the <ORGANIZATION> Canadian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> received 188 applications for immigrant visas and in the first five months of this year, applications stood at 1,292. Only 275 were issued. The Argentine government issues no figures on the number or job skills of emigrants, but officials at variousd consulates said visa applications are way up, and usually it's the best educated and best trained who are taken. The longest lines are outside the consulates of <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, the countries to which a majority of Argentines trace their roots. <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> generally offers visas to grandchildren of its emigrants and <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> to children of people born in those countries who never renounced their citizenship. Those visas are coveted because they will allow Argentines to work thoughout <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> beginning in 1992, when the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> is unified into a single market. <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> granted about 480 immigrant visas in 1986 and 1987, the consulate said, and inquiries for the nine-month period that ended in March skyrocketed to 16,330. It gave no figures on the number of visas to be granted. <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Fainstein </PERSON>, dean of the Latin American Rabbinic Seminary, estimated that 2,000 Jews left <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> last year for <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. `` There has been an increase ... because of the permanent instability and insecurity here,'' he said. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> issued 1,450 to 1,500 immigrant visas to Argentines in the past few years, a consular officer said. The number of applications is not kept, but it clearly exceeds the number of acceptances and probably has increased in recent months, the official added. Standing in line at the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Consulate, <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Ponti </PERSON> said he hopes to move to <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, to work in his uncle's clothing store. `` My family split in two after World War II,'' said <PERSON> Ponti </PERSON>, 27, who works on the <LOCATION> Buenos </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aires </LOCATION> subway. `` One part went to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION>, another part came here to <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>. The American side of the family is doing very well.''

<HEAD>A Million Memories for Parents of Chappaquiddick Victim</HEAD>

<BYLINE>AP Special Correspondent</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 Time has neither diminished the pain nor dimmed the memories of <PERSON> Gwen </PERSON> and <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Kopechne </PERSON> after two decades of mourning their only child. `` Oh, God, there are a million of them,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Kopechne </PERSON> of her daughter, <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Jo </PERSON>, who died 20 years ago when a car driven by Sen. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> plunged off a narrow bridge on <LOCATION> Chappaquiddick </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> next to <PERSON> Martha </PERSON>'s Vineyard in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>. `` There's so darn many things,'' she said. `` We was three people together all the time. And even her being away from home, we were closely in touch. Our whole life is wrapped around our kid.'' Their memories of <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Jo </PERSON> are never more vivid than on the anniversary of the accident each July 18. All these many years later, they are still reeling through uncertainty and anxiety amidst renewed charges of a cover-up to save <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>'s political career. <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Jo </PERSON>'s portrait, a gift to her from a boyfriend of long ago, stares down at them from a wall in the living room, a haunting reminder that she died a week before her 29th birthday. Autographed photos of <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>'s brothers, President <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> and Attorney General <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, stand side by side in the sitting room, another journey back to a time when <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Jo </PERSON> worked in their presidential campaigns. Indeed, that is what had taken her to <LOCATION> Chappaquiddick </LOCATION> that July weekend, a cookout and reunion for a dozen men and women who had worked in <PERSON> Robert </PERSON>'s 1968 campaign. `` Everything we look at reminds us of our daughter,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Kopechne </PERSON> said in a telephone interview from her home in the <LOCATION> Pocono </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountains </LOCATION> of <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>. `` There are a lot of knickknacks around of hers. We never put anything of hers away.'' There are no photos of <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>. `` Absolutely not,'' said <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Jo </PERSON>'s father. Asked if he was bitter toward <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, he answered, `` Yes and no,'' then paused. `` No, I do n't want to answer anything like that.'' `` I would n't go out of my way to be friendly,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Kopechne </PERSON>. `` He does n't mean anything to me.'' She said she could not remember the last time she talked to <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>. `` Maybe it was when he was running for the -LRB- 1980 presidential -RRB- nomination.'' The years have taken a physical toll on the <LOCATION> Kopechnes </LOCATION>, and the 20th anniversary of the tragedy promises to be emotional. Just the other day, Mrs. <PERSON> Kopechne </PERSON>, 71, had to go to the doctor. `` The stress is getting too much for me,'' she said. `` I'm falling apart I do n't want to talk. I get too upset just having to talk about it constantly. We've been bothered with people on the property. They've been knocking on our bedroom door. We do n't answer the door. We did n't answer the phone for a couple of weeks, but that's ridiculous that we ca n't even answer our own phone.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Kopechne </PERSON> had surgery for suspected cancer last January. `` They found no cancer,'' she said. `` I came out clean, but this is what they watch with me now.'' <PERSON> Kopechne </PERSON>, 76, underwent cancer surgery 12 years ago, about the same time he retired as an insurance salesman. `` I lost half my stomach, my spleen, my gallbladder, part of my pancreas, but hell, it did n't make any difference to me. I'm still going better than I ever did.'' He plays tennis three or four times a week and occasionally he volunteers his help to Meals on Wheels, delivering food to the elderly. He is an avid reader with particular interest in nutrition. `` I follow my nutritional value,'' he said. `` That's what's keeping me going There are proper foods and the proper way of looking at things. Your outlook on life. That means a hell of a lot.'' The Kopechnes declined to talk much about <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, but Mrs. <PERSON> Kopechne </PERSON> said she was glad the foreman in the grand jury investigation of <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Jo </PERSON>'s death recently renewed allegations that officials tried to cover up information to protect <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>. Several members of the same grand jury also asserted a district attorney prevented the jury from calling several key witnesses, including <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> and his cousin, <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Gargan </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, because they had testified previously at an inquest. `` I'm glad to see somebody else coming along,'' she said. `` There's where the answers are, partly up there. We do n't know anything. We wait to hear from somebody else. We're glad to hear somebody else has come out and said something.'' <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, who waited 10 hours before notifying authorities of the accident, has taken full responsibility and expressed remorse for the tragedy over the years, most recently in a prepared statement issued shortly before the anniversary. `` There was a full and complete investigation by authorities, and there have been extensive additional investigations by the press,'' he said. `` I have expressed my remorse and reponsibility to my own family, to the <PERSON> Kopechne </PERSON> family, and to the people of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, and I express those sentiments again. I have told everything I know about the accident.'' `` He has n't said anything he has n't said before,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Kopechne </PERSON>. `` I think there's a lot can be said that was n't said.'' Thirteen years ago, the <LOCATION> Kopechnes </LOCATION> moved from <LOCATION> Berkeley </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Heights </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, back to <PERSON> Joe </PERSON>'s native <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, buying a brick ranch home in <LOCATION> Swiftwater </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, 120 miles from <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>. They paid for it with a $ 140,904 settlement they received from <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> and his insurance company. `` We wanted to be in between our friends in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Kopechne </PERSON> said. They are closer to <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Jo </PERSON> now, only 50 miles away, an hour and 20 minute drive. She is buried halfway up a mountain near a church they once attended a few miles from <ORGANIZATION> Forty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fort </ORGANIZATION>, a town of 5,500 people where <PERSON> Kopechne </PERSON> grew up. They visit <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Jo </PERSON>'s grave about once a month, never letting her memory fade. `` You would n't either if you had a daughter like her,'' said <PERSON> Kopechne </PERSON>.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pickering </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> is not above telling a lie to make a good story better, and he encourages the students in his writing course to do the same. `` You've got to lie to give the illusion of truth,'' the English professor tells his students at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Connecticut </ORGANIZATION>. Given that philosophy, it's not surprising that <PERSON> Pickering </PERSON> finds himself caught up in the excitement over a bit of fiction written by a former student. The teacher <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Keating </PERSON>, played by <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> in the movie `` Dead Poets Society,'' is modeled after <PERSON> Pickering </PERSON>. Like <PERSON> Keating </PERSON>, <PERSON> Pickering </PERSON> has been known to do the unusual in his classroom. He's lectured from a desktop, from outside a window or while wearing wastepaper baskets on his feet. He also returned to his prep school as a young teacher after studying in <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>. But unlike the movie, there was never any conflict between <PERSON> Pickering </PERSON> and school administrators, and he left the school on good terms. `` Whatever of me is in that character has got to be small,'' the 47-year-old <PERSON> Pickering </PERSON> said during recent interview at his home. `` I was a kid and he was a child. Twenty-three years ago. How much of me could there be in the movie? Not very much.'' The screenplay was written by <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Schulman </PERSON>, who was a 15-year-old student at <ORGANIZATION> Montgomery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Nashville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>, when he took a course from <PERSON> Pickering </PERSON>. <PERSON> Pickering </PERSON>, who had returned to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> after a year of study at <ORGANIZATION> Cambridge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, taught at the private school for just one year, 1965-66. <PERSON> Schulman </PERSON> has acknowledged <PERSON> Pickering </PERSON>'s influence on his life and the screenplay, and has said much of his love for language and literature originated in that course. <PERSON> Pickering </PERSON> has n't seen the movie _ his three children were sick and now he's in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> for the summer. But many of his friends in <LOCATION> Nashville </LOCATION> have seen the film, and they immediately recognized <PERSON> Pickering </PERSON> as the inspiration for the movie's teacher. The friends began talking and soon the news media picked up on the subject. `` I do n't mind being the center of attention if I can control it, but I ca n't control this,'' he said of the numerous inquiries he's received from reporters and acquaintances <PERSON> Pickering </PERSON>, who was born and raised in <LOCATION> Nashville </LOCATION>, is puzzled as to why he had so much influence on a former student and how it was that his friends so readily saw him in the movie. He's also flattered. `` I'm the most ordinary guy in the world,'' he said as he draped his leg over the arm of a chair and picked at a hole in the knee of his jeans. `` Sometimes people remember me, and I do n't know why. I do n't know if I did anything special then as a teacher. I was young and lively.'' What he does in class is unplanned, he said. He does many unusual things to get his students to think for themselves, but a bad back has forced him to abandon such acrobatics as desktop lectures. His classroom is also on the second floor now, making the leaps from windows unwise. `` Sometimes you get bored in the classroom,'' he said. `` This semester when my class was over, the last class, two girls in my class jumped up and gave an imitation of me right in front of the class. They got A's. You'd think they might get F's, but I've learned since. <PERSON> Pickering </PERSON> bursts into laughter after telling the story. He laughs often and easily as he recalls the past. He finds many things humorous in life and often downplays his own accomplishments. Since leaving <ORGANIZATION> Montgomery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION>, he has completed a doctorate and taught in <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Jordon </PERSON> and at <ORGANIZATION> Dartmouth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>. He's been at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Connecticut </ORGANIZATION> since 1978, where in addition to teaching, he's become well-known as an essayist. He writes about his three children, his wife, his mother and father and ordinary things in life. His writing, as might be expected, is humorous and self-critical, but also bawdy and philosophical. He has published three books of his essays and is working on a fourth. He plans to write an essay on the celebrity that has come to him in the wake of `` Dead Poets Society.'' His most recent book, `` May Days'' -LRB- University of <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, 1988 -RRB-, includes an essay on <ORGANIZATION> Montgomery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION>. It pokes fun at the idea of a `` Southern gentleman'' and <PERSON> Pickering </PERSON>'s exploits as a student, athlete and practical joker. From these experiences, <PERSON> Pickering </PERSON> has shaped a teaching philosophy that has in turn influenced many others. `` There are very few givens that I accept. I do n't reject any either. But I think that kids ought to start looking,'' <PERSON> Pickering </PERSON> said. `` When somebody says it's green, then you should turn around and say maybe it's not green. What's the truth? That's all I do.''

 With their first album of new material in nine years zooming up the charts, the original members of the <ORGANIZATION> Doobie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION> band are taking it to the streets. But they're taking it easier between shows. `` I think everybody's just wanting to take care of themselves a little better than they used to,'' lead singer <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnston </PERSON> said in a recent interview during a two-day stop in the <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> area. `` Consequently, everybody's a little quieter when they go back to their room than they used to be. They do n't stay out all night boogying.'' Added drummer <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Hartman </PERSON>, 70 pounds lighter than the last time he did any intense touring, `` The road treats us the same, we just do n't treat it the same.'' These Doobies made up the earliest version of the band, the guitar-based act with a hard rock style that recorded such hits as `` <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Grove </LOCATION>,'' `` Listen to the Music,'' `` Jesus Is Just Alright'' and `` Black Water.'' The new album, `` Cycles,'' already has gone gold _ more than 500,000 copies sold within two weeks of release. It means there will be at least one more Doobies album. <PERSON> Johnston </PERSON> says he has six or seven songs waiting at home, including one yanked from `` Cycles'' at the last minute. The first single from the album, `` The Doctor,'' was at No. 11 on the Billboard charts as of June 30. Its sound, most often compared with `` <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> Grove,'' should be no surprise, <PERSON> Hartman </PERSON> said. `` You come out with a new album. You're supposed to sound like, what, <PERSON> Montovanni </PERSON>?'' <PERSON> Hartman </PERSON> asked sarcastically. `` You've got the same guys who wrote the same hits back in the early days. What's -LRB- <PERSON> Johnston </PERSON> -RRB- supposed to sound like <PERSON> Elvis </PERSON>?'' <PERSON> Johnston </PERSON>, <PERSON> Hartman </PERSON>, guitarist <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON>, bassist <PERSON> Tiran </PERSON> <PERSON> Porter </PERSON>, drummer <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Hossack </PERSON> and percussionist <PERSON> Bobby </PERSON> <PERSON> LaKind </PERSON> make up this version of the band, whose evolution requires a scorecard. There were 14 <ORGANIZATION> Doobies </ORGANIZATION> _ none of them related _ from 1972 to 1982. The Johnston-led band gave way to the slicker, rhythm and blues version fronted by <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> McDonald </PERSON> in the late'70s that scored the hits `` Takin' It to the Streets,'' `` What a Fool Believes,'' which was named record of the year at the Grammy Awards in 1979, and the Grammy winning-album `` Minute by Minute.'' A 1987 reunion concert for <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> veterans brought a dozen Doobies together. It led to a mini-tour and a Fourth of July concert in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. After that, the musicians went their separate ways. Producer <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Templeman </PERSON>, who was with the band through all its changes, talked to <PERSON> Johnston </PERSON> and the original Doobies about getting back together for a new album. `` We were all playing in bands around the bay area and recording and doing stuff; it just was n't on a very big scale,'' <PERSON> Johnston </PERSON> said. `` Basically, it was like starting all over again. We all knew each other. The music, it's all new tunes. That's why the album was called ` Cycles,' because we've been through a lot of cycles, mostly the spin cycle.'' The success of `` Cycles'' never was guaranteed, but air play of `` The Doctor,'' coupled with classic rock radio play of oldies, has created a new generation of <LOCATION> Doobie </LOCATION> fans. `` Kids from 17 on up have been showing up at the concerts as well as people who knew us from before,'' <PERSON> Johnston </PERSON> said. `` I think they find it interesting to go back and listen to the'70s - type stuff as well as what we've doing on the new album Success still is welcome to a band _ even after it has sold 80 million albums. `` I knew a lot of people wanted to hear rock' n' roll <ORGANIZATION> Doobie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION> and stuff,'' said <PERSON> Johnston </PERSON>. `` We did n't try to make this album sound like 1974. We tried to make it sound like the songs we had written.'' This time out, the <ORGANIZATION> Doobies </ORGANIZATION> are playing 12 to 14 concerts, then laying off for 10 days before beginning another round. There are 65 concerts planned on the `` Cycles'' tour. `` We used to do 200-plus gigs a year, and when we were n't gigging, we were in the studio, so you never saw home and you never really got rested up,'' <PERSON> Johnston </PERSON> said `` I do n't want to go out for that many dates a year anymore anyway. It's crazy. And I do n't think you need to. I do n't think we needed to back then either.'' These days, family members travel occasionally with the band members. <PERSON> Hartman </PERSON>, whose family prefers to stay behind, gets out to museums, parks and shopping malls. <PERSON> Johnston </PERSON> and others read novels. `` We're not trashing hotel rooms anymore and we're not having door wars with rent-a-cars, burning up stages and things of that nature.'' <PERSON> Johnston </PERSON> said. `` Everybody's become a little bit more selective, especially being married, they do n't mess around.''

<HEAD>Recession Coming _ Or Already Here?</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Also on financial wires.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHET CURRIER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Forget for a moment, if you will, the months-old debate on Wall Street over whether the economy is headed for a recession. Consider instead the possibility that such a slump might already have begun. This is by no means a majority view, or even suspicion, among the economists of the financial world. Many economists still argue that the recent slowing of the economy will bottom out with nothing worse than a spell of sluggish growth. Once that happy news is established, they contend, the rallying cry will be `` Onward and upward!'' for both the stock market and the producing and consuming economy. Nevertheless, some observers say, if a recession is destined to occur, it would be very much in keeping with past patterns if it were to sneak in unnoticed and take a firm hold several months before its presence is officially detected. Such a sneak-attack effect can be enhanced by the much-publicized, but still easily overlooked, lag time between economic events and the reporting of data used to measure them. The statistics that lately have heightened recession worries have covered May and June, the latter stages of the second quarter of 1989. But even as investors react to them, the third quarter is well under way. The formal definition of recession, as established by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION>, is at least two consecutive quarters of declines in the gross national product, after adjustment for inflation. If that kind of an event were to occur in the third and fourth quarters of this year, it would n't be certified as such until early 1990. Of course, the government and private economists employ other tools to try to get a more up-to-date reading of where things are headed. One of these, the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s index of leading economic indicators, dropped 1.2 percent in May for its third decline in four months _ bordering on the traditional standard that recognizes three down months in a row as a recession warning. `` We've never been much of a fan of this index as a gauge to future economic growth,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Resler </PERSON>, economist at <ORGANIZATION> Nomura </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` But this latest report had an ominous quality to it.'' Given the leading indicators' spotty record in the past, many private analysts have their own favorite statistical barometers. Subscribers to the doctrine known as monetarism, for instance, argue that slow or no growth in the money supply has already sounded a clear signal of trouble ahead. Others cite the `` inverted yield curve'' _ with short-term interest rates higher than long-term interest rates _ that has prevailed for much of this year as a likely portent of stormy weather. No matter how many forecasting aids are available, though, it seems evident that the `` soft landing'' vs. recession argument on Wall Street wo n't be settled until some months after the fact. All the reports since early this year showing a slowing of economic growth `` are also the way that recessions come about,'' observed <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> DeVoe </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, an analyst at <ORGANIZATION> Legg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mason </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wood </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Walker </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` If continued as they're now tracking,'' <PERSON> DeVoe </PERSON> added, `` they would indicate the growing likelihood of a recession _ if the economy is not already in one.''

 While <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Rose </PERSON>'s betting makes headlines, millions of less prominent lives are afflicted by an addiction to gambling that some experts fear may become more widespread. `` We are viewing compulsive gambling as the mental health epidemic of the 1990s,'' declares <PERSON> Valerie </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorenz </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pathological </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gambling </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION>. Adds <PERSON> Sirgay </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanger </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Compulsive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gambling </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, `` I think we're possibly headed into a decade in which gambling will be the addiction of choice'' among young people. It may be seen as a readily available and attractive alternative if alcohol and drugs become less popular, he says. Almost $ 253 billion was bet in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> last year, legally and illegally, according to the magazine Gaming and Wagering Business. Tables games such as roulette and baccarat drew $ 126 billion, and slot machines about $ 37 billion. Lotteries and parimutuel events such as horse racing each took in more than $ 17 billion, the magazine says. The vast majority of gamblers are not addicted to betting. But perhaps 3 percent of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> adults, which comes to about 5 million people, are hooked. So are a significant percentage of high school students, some studies suggest. Fifteen years ago, the compulsive gambler was typically a middle-age white businessman, <PERSON> Lorenz </PERSON> said, but now treatment programs see people in their teens and early 20s, deeply in debt, suicidal and threatened by bookies. She said she expects compulsive gambling to grow as more states adopt lotteries and other games of chance to raise revenue, promoting the idea of gambling and making it easier for susceptible people to become hooked. Already, `` we are seeing an increase in all forms of gambling,'' said <PERSON> Lorenz </PERSON>. Some 15 percent of calls to her organization's hotline are from people who say they are hooked on lotteries, she said, while `` six years ago I never heard of a lottery addict.'' But <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Blaine </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> and Provincial Lotteries, said experts have told him that lotteries do not interest most compulsive gamblers. The addicts want faster action, such as casino games, and games of perceived skill rather than pure chance, <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> said. While lotteries may promote the idea of gambling, `` it's a long step to say then that that gets people to be compulsive gamblers,'' <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Rose </PERSON>'s situation does not directly involve the question of whether he is a compulsive gambler, and <PERSON> Lorenz </PERSON> and <PERSON> Sanger </PERSON> said they could not make a diagnosis from news stories. But <PERSON> Lorenz </PERSON> said <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> shows some traits consistently found in compulsive gamblers: competitiveness, intelligence, ability with numbers, athletic ability and a high energy level. And his denials of improper betting `` in the face of overwhelming evidence'' suggest the reaction of a compulsive gambler, she said. People who buy a lottery ticket every day or bet substantial sums are not necessarily compulsive gamblers. The addiction involves a collection of other specific behaviors. For example, compulsive gamblers may continue betting despite mounting debts, the disintegration of life at home and on the job, and their own efforts to stop. They may have to bet more and more in order to feel the excitement they crave. They may frequently gamble more money or for a longer time than planned, and may repeatedly try to win back losses. The goal is not to gain money, but to gamble. They may bet on a sure loser, or on both sides of a contest, just to stay in the action. For these people, gambling is a way to feel alive, to feel powerful in a generally powerless life, to feel accepted, to feel special. But when compulsive gamblers hit bottom, they often are in debt for one or two times their annual salaries, <PERSON> Lorenz </PERSON> said. Many will have turned to writing bad checks, forgery or embezzlement to fuel their habit. About one in five who enter Gamblers Anonymous or treatment programs has tried suicide, studies suggest. What kinds of people become compulsive gamblers? `` Young and old, rich and poor, black and white, all socio-economic levels, all educational levels,'' <PERSON> Lorenz </PERSON> said. Many excelled in athletics in high school and college, she said, and her organization's hotline gets an occasional call from professional athletes who fear that if they seek help, they will be identified and fired. Compulsive gamblers also frequently grew up in a family with an unusual emphasis on money, whether it was a very poor family or a rich one that set a high economic standard for the child, she said. With treatment, gamblers can be freed of a disorder that hands them a greater loss than any of their bets. <PERSON> Lorenz </PERSON> said she recently testified on behalf of a bank officer, a basically honest man with two children, who had embezzled $ 1 million to pay off his bookies. `` He had nothing to show for it,'' <PERSON> Lorenz </PERSON> said, `` other than the action of gambling.''

 Actress <PERSON> Brooke </PERSON> <PERSON> Theiss </PERSON> works hard because she still remembers the time she nearly failed kindergarten. She stars in the <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> comedy series `` Just the Ten of Us'' as one of the daughters, and she's the spokeswoman for <ORGANIZATION> Hasbro </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Maxie </PERSON> doll in commercials and personal appearances. She also recently boarded a cruise ship for an <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> movie tentatively called `` Semester at Sea,'' and in `` Nightmare on Elm Street IV: The Dreammaster'' last year, she turned into a giant cockroach. <PERSON> Theiss </PERSON> tries hard because she has to. She suffers from a learning disability called dyslexia. `` I make personal appearances before girls' groups and talk about my dyslexia and being held back,'' she said. `` I almost flunked kindergarten. I could n't read. It was n't until the third grade that I was tested and diagnosed as having dyslexia. I did n't know my left from my right. I have trouble dialing the telephone. Everyone has some problem. I've learned some other artists have dyslexia _ <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Cruise </PERSON>, <PERSON> Cher </PERSON>, writer <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Cannell </PERSON>.'' She took special classes in school and learned to read with relative ease. But she also admits that `` we were a little too pampered in some classes. I'd even use dyslexia as an excuse until college. I was n't really motivated until then.'' After high school, she attended <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, which she said has a special program for dyslexics. All of her books were available on audio tape. She grew up in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, the daughter of an advertising executive and a real estate saleswoman. But acting was in her genes. Her mother, <PERSON> Kathy </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, had been a model and actress who appeared in many live television productions in the 1950s. Her father, <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Thies </PERSON>, had played the villain in Western movies before going into advertising. <PERSON> Brooke </PERSON> changed the spelling of her last name to make it easier to pronounce. Her first break was the contract to represent the <PERSON> Maxie </PERSON> doll. `` They were looking for someone who looked like the doll,'' said <PERSON> Theiss </PERSON>, a petite blonde who looks younger than her 19 years. `` I have a big wig and clothes that look like all her costumes. Parents bring their kids to my personal appearances and talk to me like I'm 12 years old `` The <PERSON> Maxie </PERSON> doll is a fashion doll for children too young for Barbie. When you're 12 you do n't think about a career. You dream about going to the prom and getting your driver's license.'' She had just returned to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> from filming some doll commercials when she got a call to appear on <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Growing Pains.'' The comedy `` Just the Ten of Us'' began as a spinoff of `` Growing Pains'' in January 1988. Flying to <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> on Sunday, she auditioned on Monday, got the role later that day and began work on Wednesday. She plays <PERSON> Wendy </PERSON> <PERSON> Lubbock </PERSON>, one of eight children of the football coach at an all-boys school. <PERSON> Jamie </PERSON> <PERSON> Luner </PERSON> is her twin sister, <PERSON> Cindy </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirchenbauer </PERSON> and <PERSON> Deborah </PERSON> <PERSON> Harmon </PERSON> are the parents. `` We play them as 16,'' she said. `` <PERSON> Wendy </PERSON> is very rambunctious and rowdy. She's fun-loving and has no regrets. She takes risks, she's the instigator. <PERSON> Cindy </PERSON>'s more sensible and subtle. All the kids are different and have well-developed personalities.'' Prior to the spinoff she'd made a guest appearance on `` Growing Pains'' as another character. She was first cast in a small role in the movie `` Little Nikita,'' which starred <PERSON> Sidney </PERSON> <PERSON> Poitier </PERSON> and <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION>. `` When they screened the movie I went with my mother and grandmother,'' she said. `` I told my mother when my part was coming up. They cut my part out of the movie. My grandmother, who does n't hear well, said very loudly, ` Did they cut it?'

<DATELINE>CHAPPAQUIDDICK ISLAND, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 It's not even the same bridge anymore. New posts and guardrails have been added, but that was some time ago, and now Dike Bridge is rotting. Gulls fly over and drop shellfish on it to break open their supper. Not much to it. No signs, no reminders. But Dike Bridge is on <LOCATION> Chappaquiddick </LOCATION>. It lives oversized in American political history because Sen. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> drove his Oldsmobile off the bridge into <LOCATION> Poucha </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pond </LOCATION> around midnight 20 years ago. <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Jo </PERSON> <PERSON> Kopechne </PERSON>, a 28-year-old <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> secretary, was found dead in the back seat about 10 hours later. <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, then 37, did not notify police until 9:30 a.m., long after he returned to his hotel, across the water on <PERSON> Martha </PERSON>'s Vineyard. He said he and a friend repeatedly dove to the car in unsuccessful rescue attempts, and that he was then `` exhausted and in a state of shock.'' Since the accident the night of July 18, 1969, <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> voters have re-elected <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> four times to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> by healthy margins. But most people think the string of events that occurred after he left a cottage party that night probably cost him the White House. The incident has been an albatross around the island's neck as well. Like <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, most longtime <LOCATION> Chappaquiddick </LOCATION> residents do n't like to discuss the accident. It is a bitter memory, the day their pastoral existence became the focus of the worst sort of publicity _ the heir to the <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> family dynasty had sullied not just his reputation but theirs, too. When asked about the accident and the impact it's had on their lives, Vineyarders who have lived in <LOCATION> Edgartown </LOCATION> or on <LOCATION> Chappaquiddick </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> for more than 20 years often become silent. One <LOCATION> Edgartown </LOCATION> real estate agent, usually smiling and friendly, momentarily choked up when asked about the accident and then refused to discuss it. <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Tomassian </PERSON>, the head of the <ORGANIZATION> Martha </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Vineyard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Historical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Preservation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>, has lived in <LOCATION> Edgartown </LOCATION> eight years. She has sensed some of her neighbors' resentment about the incident. `` <PERSON> Martha </PERSON>'s Vineyard, pre-Chappaquiddick, was sort of a quiet vacation spot. The international attention that centered here immediately after the incident and during the trial, and the focus that has been put on the Vineyard since then, has really unfortunately put the Vineyard on the map,'' <PERSON> Tomassian </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> eventually pleaded guilty to leaving the scene of an accident and received a two-month suspended prison sentence. He was placed on probation for one year. Judge <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Boyle </PERSON>, who oversaw the nine-month inquest, expressed doubt about key portions of <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>'s testimony. When <PERSON> Boyle </PERSON>'s final report was released in April 1970, the case was officially closed. But public debate over its ramifications continues. The Dike Bridge connects a beautiful strip of beach with the rest of <LOCATION> Chappaquiddick </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, at the eastern side of <PERSON> Martha </PERSON>'s Vineyard. In May, tall fences were erected on either side of the bridge _ long since closed to vehicular traffic _ and the only way to reach the beach now is to drive an all-terrain vehicle south for about five miles before doubling back north. Town officials are concerned about safety at the bridge, but sporadic arguments over the years reveal another factor in the move to tear it down _ embarrassment over the dubious tourist attraction. Most tourists do n't journey to <PERSON> Martha </PERSON>'s Vineyard soley to see the scene of what has been called `` the most famous traffic fatality in the history of American politics.'' But, as long as they're down there, it's right across the ferry ... `` Yeah, people ask about it every day,'' said a teen-age girl running the four-car ferry from <LOCATION> Edgartown </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Chappaquiddick </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>. `` We get a car asking on every trip across.'' Once tourists get out to Dike Bridge, there's not a lot to see _ just a simple wooden bridge across a decidedly uninteresting pond. Beyond the bridge are the dunes, and still farther the vast blue of Nantucket Sound. `` They find themselves very disappointed,'' said <PERSON> Patric </PERSON> <PERSON> Jamo </PERSON>, a waiter at a restaurant on the edge of <LOCATION> Edgartown </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION>. `` There's really nothing there. <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Malcouronne </PERSON>, the president of the <ORGANIZATION> Edgartown </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> and manager of the <ORGANIZATION> Colonial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inn </ORGANIZATION>, contends the bridge is n't that much of a tourist draw. She says most of the summertime tourists choose the Vineyard for other reasons and visitors might not even be aware of the significance of the bridge. `` It's a whole other time, a time warp,'' <PERSON> Malcouronne </PERSON> said. Whether the islanders like it or not, though, the accident is fixed in their psyche. A headline that appeared in the <ORGANIZATION> Vineyard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gazette </ORGANIZATION> referred to the debate over tearing down the `` Kennedy Bridge.'' Just up the block from the Colonial Inn is the <LOCATION> Shiretown </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Inn </LOCATION>, the hotel where <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> stayed on his visit two decades ago. <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> had walked through the hotel's lobby the morning of the accident and stood on a balcony talking about yachts with other vacationers before he filed an accident report with the <LOCATION> Edgartown </LOCATION> police. The new owners of the Shiretown have taken down a sign that hung behind the front desk telling people not to bother asking about <LOCATION> Chappaquiddick </LOCATION>, or what room <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> was staying in. But they still shun inquiries. `` We have no comment,'' said a hotel worker who would n't give her name. `` People do n't ask about it. It's not a big thing anymore. We were n't even around then.'' <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, who has over the years expressed sadness about the accident, responded with a prepared statement when asked about the incident recently. `` I took full responsibility for the tragedy at the time, and I still do,'' <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> said. `` There was a full and complete investigation by authorities, and there have been extensive additional investigations by the press. I have expressed my remorse and responsibility to my own family, to the <PERSON> Kopechne </PERSON> family, and to the people of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, and I express those sentiments again. `` I have told everything I know about the accident. I only wish that it were in my power to do something more to ease the continuing pain that I feel and that Mr. and Mrs. <PERSON> Kopechne </PERSON> feel for <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Jo </PERSON>'s loss. In a recent <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> interview, <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Jo </PERSON> <PERSON> Kopechne </PERSON>'s parents spoke mostly about how they still grieve over the loss of their daughter Mrs. <PERSON> Kopechne </PERSON> did say she was pleased the foreman in the grand jury investigation of her daughter's death had recently renewed his assertion that officials tried to cover up information to protect <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>. She had little to say about <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, but in another interview with a magazine she and her husband had harsh words for the senator. `` He was worried about himself, not <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Jo </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Kopechne </PERSON> said. He said his daughter did not die in vain because it kept <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> from becoming president. <PERSON> Kopechne </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Gwen </PERSON>, said they had had two brief meetings with the senator since the accident. `` Those were really ridiculous meetings,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Kopechne </PERSON> said. `` Nobody told me anything, and I did n't even know what to ask. I want him to tell me what happened. Ca n't he relieve us of this?''

<TEXT>
 A Turkish peasant claims one of his kidneys was stolen. <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> prison inmates trade organs for reduced sentences. Brokers in human body parts take their cut of a shadowy market. The forces of supply and demand in the desperate world of organ transplants have created a commercial trade in human organs that worries health officials and ethicists worldwide. The need for organs to replace faltering body parts is growing as research advances and surgery is more successful. But the number of donated organs has failed to keep pace. Doctors say too few people die in circumstances that provide transplantable organs. When they do, relatives are often too grieved to donate a loved one's organ or object for religious or cultural reasons. What to do about the organ trade varies. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> ban it. In <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, such trade thrives legally. Lawmakers in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> have just begun grappling with the matter. `` There simply does n't seem to be any country that has a public policy to generate enough organs to meet the demand,'' said <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Caplan </PERSON>, director of the Center for Biomedical Ethics at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Minnesota </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> in May called for a global ban on commercial trafficking in human organs. Dr. <PERSON> Ursula </PERSON> <PERSON> Lehr </PERSON>, the West German health minister, spoke for the ban. `` The idea of business-minded brokers taking advantage of the financial distress of people in the Third World, buying their organs for a pittance and reselling them to wealthy patients in developed countries, is awful for me,'' she said. But some ask what's wrong if people, fully informed of the risks, decide to sell one of their organs, for example, a kidney? The question, however, becomes complicated when the potential donor is desperately poor. People can live with one kidney, and offers for transplantable kidneys have ranged in individual instances from $ 3,000 to $ 20,000. `` Is it really for us, who are not faced with those difficulties and that heart-rending decision, to deny people that choice?'' <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> lawmaker, asked in recent parliamentary debate. `` It really is n't a choice if you're coerced by poverty,'' said <PERSON> Caplan </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> ethicist. Others worry that selling organs would decrease the supply of donated organs and make transplants more expensive in general. `` We believe ... organs would go to the highest bidder rather than to the patient who needs them most,'' said <PERSON> Bernadette </PERSON> <PERSON> Haze </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the Netherlands-based <ORGANIZATION> Eurotransplant </ORGANIZATION>, which matches organ donors and recipients in the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Luxembourg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, which has no law controlling the sale of organs, took up the issue this year after a Turk was arrested in <LOCATION> Istanbul </LOCATION> for arranging commercial transplants at a private <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> hospital. One of the `` donors'' contended he was duped and robbed of his kidney. The alleged organ broker, <PERSON> Tunc </PERSON> <PERSON> Ay </PERSON> <PERSON> Kunter </PERSON>, was convicted May 18 and sentenced to two years in prison for brokering the sale of a Turkish peasant's kidney to a Libyan doctor. Police said <PERSON> Kunter </PERSON> confessed to arranging four such sales when he was arrested. Turkish law allows organ donation but outlaws selling, brokering or buying human organs. The peasant, <PERSON> Ahmet </PERSON> <PERSON> Koc </PERSON>, who got a two-year suspended sentence, contended he went to the hospital for a physical connected to a job offer and thought he was being anesthetized for the checkup. After the kidney was removed, he said he was paid the equivalent of $ 4,267. British lawmakers have introduced legislation making it a crime to pay or receive payment for a human organ. Parliament is expected to pass it this month. Organ sales are not illegal in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>, but in late May, the vice president of the <ORGANIZATION> Philippines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> filed a bill to ban sales of human organs and tissues, calling practitioners `` modern-day Draculas.'' Filipino death row prisoners began donating organs in 1976 as part of a program to reduce overcrowding without resorting to widespread executions, explained <PERSON> Pablo </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosales </PERSON>, assistant director of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Penitentiary </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Rosales </PERSON> said most donor inmates avoided execution and some were freed after spending a few more years in prison. When capital punishment was banned in 1987, prisoners started asking for money, he said. One prisoner who donated a kidney even complained to <PERSON> Rosales </PERSON> that he received only $ 95, without the mini-cassette recorder he was promised. Media attention greatly reduced the number of people seeking prisoners' organs, <PERSON> Rosales </PERSON> said, and no prisoner has donated a kidney since last year. But <PERSON> Rosales </PERSON> believes organ sales continue with private donors, most likely poor slum dwellers. Dr. <PERSON> Kazuo </PERSON> <PERSON> Ota </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transplantation </ORGANIZATION>, said he knew of several patients who had organ transplants in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> and that some Japanese were acting as organ brokers. Organ sales are banned in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. Dr. <PERSON> Jorge </PERSON> <PERSON> Neumann </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Sao </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Paulo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Heart </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> and a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Brazilian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organ </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transplants </ORGANIZATION> said that `` certainly there exists a black market of organs in <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>.'' But he said no statistics on organ sales were available. Last fall, reports in foreign newspapers that adoption rings were routinely buying babies in Third World countries and selling them to <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> and Israeli families whose children needed organ transplants prompted outrage from <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> officials. The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> in October blamed the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> for the reports and said a European <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> resolution criticizing the purported activity was based on `` false and misleading statements and a discredited report by a Soviet front organization.'' In the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, selling organs has been illegal since 1984 and sentiment against the practice is high. But allegations of influence peddling in arranging precious transplants surface from time to time. In April, <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> investigators said they had dropped an investigation into accusations that pioneering surgeon <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Starzl </PERSON>, head of transplants at Presbyterian-University and Children's hospitals in <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>, had given high-paying foreigners preferential treatment. The investigation followed newspaper articles that said about 28 percent of transplants performed by <PERSON> Starzl </PERSON>'s team in 1984-5 were on foreigners who often were n't as sick as other patients or had waited a shorter time, but who had paid surgeon's fees four times higher than Americans who had the same operations. <PERSON> Caplan </PERSON> argues for regulations to ensure that medical need, rather than money or influence, determines who gets available organs. Some in the field say the risk of exploitation would be reduced if a neutral party, such as government, replaced organ brokers. And donations might increase with incentives such as compensation to donors or their families for all medical costs, time lost from work or burial expenses. There could also be a break on inheritance or other taxes. Recently, transplant researchers began looking at animal-to-human transplants. At a May meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transplant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Physicians </ORGANIZATION>, researchers predicted pigs would become the main source of donor organs once cross-species transplantation becomes practical. `` There's always been a shortage of organs and there probably always will be unless we learn to take them out of animals,'' said <PERSON> Caplan </PERSON>. `` I do n't know if it's going to be biologically feasible, but I think that's the direction we have to try.''

<HEAD>Court's Term Showed a Dramatic Swing to the Right</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, a legacy of <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s presidency, veered dramatically to the right in its 1988-89 term as decisions on abortion, civil rights and the death penalty highlighted an invigorated political conservatism The coalescence of a dependable conservative majority led and nurtured by Chief Justice <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rehnquist </PERSON> was so pronounced that legal scholars predict it will influence the course of American society for decades. `` This is the year the <PERSON> Rehnquist </PERSON> court came of age,'' said A.E. <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Howard </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Virginia </ORGANIZATION> law professor. `` We have now seen the emergence of a bloc of justices on the court who in at least most of the court's agenda can be predictably conservative.'' In his first full term, Justice <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> tipped the balance of power _ leading some to compare his role to that of <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldberg </PERSON> on the liberal-dominated court of the 1960s. <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, the last of three high court appointments made by former President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, replaced <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Powell </PERSON>, a generally conservative justice who most often joined the court's liberal wing on abortion and civil rights. <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> served as a fulcrum, often the pivotal vote on the most divisive issues before the court. That role has been inherited by Justice <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Day </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON>, a <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> appointee more conservative than <PERSON> Powell </PERSON>. The court's conservatives also include <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> appointee <PERSON> Antonin </PERSON> <PERSON> Scalia </PERSON> and <PERSON> Byron </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON>, who was appointed by <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> in 1962. Most often left in dissent in the term's major cases were liberals <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON>, <PERSON> Thurgood </PERSON> <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON>, <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Blackmun </PERSON> and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>. Of 132 signed decisions, 32 were reached by 5-4 votes. <PERSON> Rehnquist </PERSON> was in the majority in 81 percent of those; <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON> in 22 percent. The two were on opposite sides in 30 of the 32. The court, in 5-4 votes, gave states greater power to regulate abortions, allowed capital punishment for mentally retarded murderers and killers who committed their crimes when as young as 16, and dismayed civil rights activists in a series of rulings. The court strayed from its conservative course in several free-speech decisions, most notably ruling that burning the American flag is a constitutionally protected form of political protest. Here are summaries of the major <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> rulings of the 1988-89 term:

<BYLINE>CIVIL RIGHTS</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 _ The court made it more difficult for minorities and women to prove on-the-job bias by using statistics showing that women and minorities are under-represented in an employer's higher-paying jobs _ The court gave white men more power to challenge as unlawful `` reverse discrimination'' court-approved affirmative action programs helping women and minorities _ States and state officials are not among the `` persons'' who can be sued under a much-used 1871 law authorizing monetary damages for those whose rights are violated _ Local governments may not be sued under the same 1871 law when their employees violate someone's rights unless it can be proved the violation was part of an official government policy _ Another key civil rights law, enacted in 1866, can not be used to fight on-the-job racial or sexual harassment _ The court made it more difficult for employers to defend themselves against bias charges by contending their adverse actions were based on `` mixed motives'' _ some legal and some illegal

 _ The government may seize criminal suspects' assets even if such confiscations leave the suspects unable to hire the lawyers of their choice _ The court made it significantly easier for police to stop, question and search airline passengers suspected of drug trafficking The justices upheld the arrest and conviction of a man stopped because he matched the `` profile'' characteristics of a drug courier. _ The court upheld sentencing rules that reduce the discretion individual judges have in meting out the punishment for various federal crimes _ Police may stray from the precise wording of the famous Miranda warnings given to criminal suspects, even if the result arguably confuses suspects about their right to free legal help

<BYLINE>ABORTION</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 _ The court upheld a <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> ban on public employees performing or assisting in abortions and on abortions in public hospitals Also upheld was a requirement that doctors test for fetal viability if asked to abort a pregnancy at least 20 weeks old. The state bans most abortions of viable fetuses, those able to survive outside the womb. Although stopping short of reversing its 1973 decision legalizing abortion, the court moved away from a series of abortion rulings in which similar state regulations were invalidated.

 _ Burning the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> flag is a constitutionally protected expression, although not absolutely free from criminal liability _ Government restrictions on commercial speech and on the time, place and manner of expressive activities such as controlling the noise level at rock concerts do not have to meet the `` least restrictive means'' test applied when content-based restrictions are aimed at non-commercial speech _ <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> can not put the `` dial-a-porn'' industry out of business Obscene telephone dial-up messages may be outlawed, but merely indecent messages are constitutionally protected. _ States may not bar political parties from endorsing primary election candidates _ Limited states' power to punish the reporting of lawfully obtained truthful information, even when it interferes with someone's privacy _ States may use anti-racketeering laws to prosecute the owners of adult bookstores charged with selling obscene materials, but may not close down those bookstores before trials are conducted

 _ Religious symbols such as a Christmas nativity scene may not be governmentally sponsored or displayed at government buildings if it conveys an enitrely religious message _ States may not tax non-religious publications while exempting religious ones _ States may not deny unemployment benefits to people who refuse to work on their sabbath even if the refusal is not based on a religious sect's doctrine
</TEXT>
<BYLINE>DEATH PENALTY</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 _ The death penalty can be a constitutional punishment for convicted murderers who were as young as 16 when they committed their crime The court said no national consensus exists against the execution of juvenile killers and thus the punishment is not `` cruel and unusual.'' _ Capital punishment may be imposed for mentally retarded killers _ States are under no constitutional obligation to provide free lawyers for death row inmates who lose their initial round of appeals _ Judges and juries who must choose death or life in prison for convicted murderers are allowed to consider the victim's traits

 _ Public officials may not be sued in federal court when their alleged gross negligence permits a child to be abused by a parent The justices said a state does not have a constitutional duty to protect people, including abused children, who are not in the state's custody. _ States may deny any man who says he fathered a woman's child while she was married to someone else the chance to file a `` reverse paternity'' lawsuit to prove fatherhood But the court said such men must be given a fair chance to seek visitation rights.

 _ Enormous punitive-damages awards in personal injury and other lawsuits do violate the Constitution's ban on excessive fines The ruling, however, left open the possibility that such awards may violate constitutionally protected due-process rights. _ States have sweeping powers to protect consumers by barring utilities from charging customers for the costs of abandoned nuclear power plants _ The court broadly interpreted a key federal anti-racketeering law, making it easier to use in civil lawsuits against businesses accused of fraud The court also said the law may be invoked if a single illegal scheme is advanced by more than one criminal act.

<HEAD>Retailers Post Slightly Better Sales Gains in June</HEAD>

 Sales picked up slightly at the country's big chain stores last month from May's weak pace, but growth was kept in check by a general slowdown in economic activity. `` The gains were stronger than we had seen in the prior month, but across the board they were certainly not outstanding,'' said <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Ronning </PERSON>, a retail industry analyst with the investment firm <ORGANIZATION> Brown </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Harriman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. Economists monitor retail sales for clues about consumer expenditures, which account for about two-thirds of the country's economic The reports from <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> retailers Thursday suggested that spending on big-ticket goods, like home appliances, has slowed while outlays for less expensive merchandise have n't been crimped as much by rising credit charges, reflecting interest rate hikes earlier this year. Several department stores and specialty retailers said they benefited again last month from the gradual comeback in women's clothing sales following a deep slump during the past two years <ORGANIZATION> Limited </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, one of the nation's biggest apparel retailers, posted an 11 percent increase in sales in the five weeks ended July 1. Besides its flagship women's clothing shops, <ORGANIZATION> Limited </ORGANIZATION> owns specialty stores such as <LOCATION> Victoria </LOCATION>'s Secret and <ORGANIZATION> Abercrombie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Fitch </PERSON>. The take at Limited's stores open at least a year, called same-store or comparable store sales, rose 12 percent in June. Retailers and analysts consider the same-store sales a more accurate reflection of a company's performance than totals that include sales at newly opened stores. Not every retailer reports sales on this basis. Other beneficiaries of the recovery in women's apparel included <ORGANIZATION> Dayton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hudson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which said total June sales rose 14.2 percent. The department store operator, which also runs Target and <PERSON> Mervyn </PERSON>'s stores, reported same-store sales were up 6.1 percent <ORGANIZATION> J.C. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Penney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> attributed its sales pickup to demand for summer fashions and increased purchases of soft home furnishings like bedding and bath goods Its June sales rose 7.6 percent and same-store sales increased 5.6 percent. <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Wintzer </PERSON>, who follows specialty clothing merchants for the investment firm <PERSON> Alex </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Brown </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sons </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION>, said: `` The apparel retailers are making progress but they are a little bit disappointing given how bad last year's results were.'' Recent monthly sales by apparel sellers may look much better than they actually were because they are being compared with last year, which was an exceptionally bleak time for fashion merchandising. Among the leading general merchandisers, <ORGANIZATION> K </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> mart </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, the country's second-largest retailer after <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Roebuck </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, said its June sales represented an improvement after a string of disappointing months. The discounter said sales at all of its stores went up 5.7 percent in June after a 2.5 percent increase in May. Sales at K marts open at least a year picked up 2.3 percent in June after falling 0.6 percent in May. Rival discounter <ORGANIZATION> Wal-Mart </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, third among <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> retailers, turned in another robust performance, reporting a 25 percent increase in total June sales and a 10 percent gain in same-store sales. <PERSON> Jeffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Edelman </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, said industrywide sales were uneven during June, with the weaker figures from the non-clothing categories. A series of indexes Edelman prepared indicated most types of retailers fared better in June than in May. The weighted average of 37 merchants' sales, on a same-store basis, rose 5.3 percent in June after a 4.2 percent May gain. The <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> index of sales at 14 department stores and discounters rose 4.6 percent last month vs. 3.8 percent the month before while the measurement of apparel retailers repeated a 7.7 percent increase. The index for hard goods, including furniture, electronics and household appliances, dropped 1.8 percent in June after rising 3.4 percent in May. In reports from other major retailers Thursday: <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> said its sales rose 2.9 percent in the five weeks ended July 1 from a year earlier. On a comparable-store basis, <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION>' sales increased 3.6 percent May <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> said sales rose 6.8 percent during the five weeks and same-store sales were up 5 percent. <ORGANIZATION> Melville </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> reported a 14.6 percent increase in June sales. <PERSON> Melville </PERSON> does not report same-store sales. <ORGANIZATION> Montgomery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ward </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> said its June sales increased 6.6 percent overall and 6.4 percent on a same-store basis.

<HEAD>Duracell Recalls Specialty Lithium Camera Batteries</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BETHEL, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Duracell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> is recalling two models of lithium camera batteries because of an assembly defect that can cause severe overheating and in some cases damage cameras, company officials said. The batteries affected by the recall include all <ORGANIZATION> Duracell </ORGANIZATION> XL Lithium camera batteries with the model number DL123A or DL223A and labeled `` Made in <LOCATION> USA </LOCATION>.'' The DL123A is a three-volt specialty battery, while the DL223A is a six-volt specialty battery. Both are used almost exclusively in 35mm automatic cameras. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Donahue </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Duracell </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, said Thursday that the overheating only occurred in eight out of an estimated 8 million batteries, but that the company decided to `` take the conservative step and alert customers.'' While no injuries have resulted from the defect, in some cases a camera's battery compartment was melted, <PERSON> Donahue </PERSON> said. The defect, now corrected, occurred during assembly when the anotab _ the metal strip that conducts the charge from the positive terminal to the negative terminal _ became bent, <PERSON> Donahue </PERSON> said. Once inside the camera, the defect could cause an internal short in the battery, leading it to overheat, he said. <PERSON> Donahue </PERSON> said the defect had nothing to do with the company's other business The two models in question make up about 1 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Duracell </ORGANIZATION>'s current sales volume, and costs associated with the recall are to have no significant effect on <ORGANIZATION> Duracell </ORGANIZATION>, he said. <PERSON> Donahue </PERSON> said the batteries are used in 35mm cameras that have automatic rewind and auto-advance. He said they tend to be newer models and are rarely used in cameras more than three or four years old. <ORGANIZATION> Duracell </ORGANIZATION> is asking consumers who are using the DL123A and DL223A batteries with the `` Made in <LOCATION> USA </LOCATION>'' label to throw away their batteries in an outdoor trash receptacle. They should then contact the company, giving their name and address, and they will receive free replacement batteries.

 The accounting firms <ORGANIZATION> Deloitte </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Haskins </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Sells and <ORGANIZATION> Touche </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ross </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> have agreed in principle to join forces while two larger Big Eight firms confirmed that they had entered into merger negotiations. Subject to the approval of partners at <LOCATION> Deloitte </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Touche </PERSON> <PERSON> Ross </PERSON>, the combined company would have worldwide revenue exceeding $ 4 billion and employ over 65,000 people in 101 countries. It will be known as <ORGANIZATION> Deloitte </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Touche in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, the firms said in a statement Thursday. Separately, <ORGANIZATION> Arthur </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Andersen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Price </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Waterhouse </ORGANIZATION> confirmed reports that they had begun talks about a possible merger of their worldwide operations. A confidentiality agreement will be in effect for the next 60 days while the proposition is being explored. An Andersen-Waterhouse merger would create the world's largest accounting firm, reaping $ 5 billion a year in worldwide revenue and $ 2.7 billion in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> revenue. The merger wave among the Big Eight firms began weeks ago with the announcement that <ORGANIZATION> Ernst </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Whinney </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Arthur </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Young </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> agreed to combine their operations to create an accounting firm with worldwide revenue of $ 4.2 billion and domestic revenue of $ 2 billion. Although <PERSON> Deloitte </PERSON> and <PERSON> Touche </PERSON> <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> are the smallest of the so-called Big Eight firms, they have posted the most rapid growth in recent years. Between 1985 and 1988, their individual worldwide revenue jumped more than 88 percent, according to <PERSON> Bowman </PERSON>'s Accounting Report, an industry publication Last year their worldwide growth averaged 26 percent, compared with an average of 22 percent for the other Big Eight firms. <PERSON> Deloitte </PERSON> and <PERSON> Touche </PERSON> <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> noted their desire to `` serve multinational companies in today's global economy'' as a primary reason for the merger. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kangas </PERSON>, managing partner and chief executive of <PERSON> Touche </PERSON> <PERSON> Ross </PERSON>, issued a statement saying `` a strong European capability is vital to serving our clients' needs as the economic unification of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> in 1992 approaches.'' <ORGANIZATION> Deloitte </ORGANIZATION> Chairman and Chief Executive Officer <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Cook </PERSON> also pointed to the economic growth of the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rim </LOCATION> as a need for a strengthened presence in <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>. The combined firm will draw on the expertise of the Japanese audit firm <ORGANIZATION> Tohmatsu </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Awoki </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Sanwa </PERSON>, a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Touche </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ross </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> organization. Worldwide, the firm will be known as <ORGANIZATION> Deloitte </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ross </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tohmatsu </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Kangas </PERSON> and <PERSON> Cook </PERSON> will serve as chief executives of the international organization and the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> firm, respectively. <PERSON> Kangas </PERSON> also will serve as a managing partner of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> firm. Experts generally agreed that the merger makes sense, particularly because the accounting industry has become increasingly specialized. Among Deloitte's audit clients are <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Kimberly-Clark </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Monsanto </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Procter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gamble </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Bowman </PERSON>, publisher of the Atlanta-based <PERSON> Bowman </PERSON>'s Accounting Report. <PERSON> Touche </PERSON> <PERSON> Ross </PERSON>'s audit clients include <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Litton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION>, he said. <PERSON> Deloitte </PERSON> also displays its strength in the mergers and acquisitions arena. <PERSON> Bowman </PERSON> said the firm is a favorite of <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kravis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Roberts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, the powerful <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> investment firm. <ORGANIZATION> KKR </ORGANIZATION> tapped <PERSON> Deloitte </PERSON> to perform a number of accounting-related services for its record $ 25 billion buyout of <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION> as well as other targets, including <ORGANIZATION> Safeway </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Beatrice </PERSON>. In a joint statement, Price Waterhouse Chairman <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Connor </PERSON> and <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Andersen </PERSON> Chief Executive <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Weinbach </PERSON> said the the firms are seeking to benefit from the globalization of world economies, accelerating technological changes and demand for new services and investments. `` These developments are creating a demand for increased worldwide professional and financial resources which to serve clients' needs,'' their statement read. <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Andersen </PERSON> is the second-largest <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> accounting firm, while Price Waterhouse ranks fifth. Together the two firms would audit almost 40 percent of the Fortune 500, which could lead to <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> concerns about a competitive imbalance, <PERSON> Bowman </PERSON> said. The firms did not comment on whether any employees would be let go, but observers suspect support staff will be cut. `` They will definitely have to let people go at the support level, the non-professional staffs,'' <PERSON> Bowman </PERSON> said. `` And there will be some fallout at the partner level. You do n't need two partners in charge of the same little area.'' But fees are unlikely to head lower despite savings from consolidation. `` They ca n't lower the hourly rates that they're charging, so the only thing they can save on is administrative and certain overhead costs to help the bottom line,'' said one accountant at a second-tier firm who asked not to be named.

<HEAD>Utility Mutual Funds Fare Best, Gold Funds Worst in 2nd Qtr</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Mutual funds that invested in utilities posted the biggest returns as a group in the second quarter, while gold-oriented funds fared the poorest, according to a new survey of mutual fund performance. The survey by <ORGANIZATION> Lipper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Analytical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>, distributed for release today, said utility funds had an average rate of return of 11.25 percent in the three months ended June 30, while gold-oriented funds lost 2.97 percent. That placed those two groups at the top and bottom of the list, respectively, of 20 fund groups that <ORGANIZATION> Lipper </ORGANIZATION> tracks. Its tallies assume that all dividends and capital gains distributions are reinvested. <ORGANIZATION> Lipper </ORGANIZATION> has been publishing its fund performance analysis for 16 years. `` Utility funds benefitted from both lower interest rates and particular interest in telephone company securities,'' said <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Lipper </PERSON>, president of the research concern that bears his name. He said funds invested in gold companies or bullion, on the other hand, `` have not had a period of good performance for so long that they are bound to have one some day.'' The only other group posting a negative rate of return for the quarter were international funds, which lost an average of 0.27 percent. Overall, <ORGANIZATION> Lipper </ORGANIZATION> said general equity funds outperformed fixed income funds, with a rate of return of 7.28 percent compared with 5.66 percent. That compares with a 7.61 percent rate of return in the Dow Jones industrial average of 30 blue chip stocks and 8.82 percent in the <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; P 500 index, assuming dividend reinvestment, <ORGANIZATION> Lipper </ORGANIZATION> said. Despite the slower overall performance of fixed-income funds, a pair of fixed-income funds invested mainly in zero-coupon <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> securities had the highest rate of return of more than 1,730 individual funds tracked. The Benham Target 2015 fund had a rate of return of 27.42 percent for the period while <ORGANIZATION> Benham </ORGANIZATION> Target 2010 fund gained 23.61 percent, the <ORGANIZATION> Lipper </ORGANIZATION> survey said.

 <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farm </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mutual </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Automobile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> says it will file a lawsuit challenging a <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> law that requires auto insurers to cut their rates. `` We'll probably file the complaint by the end of next week or early in the week after that,'' said <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Hill </PERSON>, a spokesman at the insurer's headquarters in <LOCATION> Bloomington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Hill </PERSON> said Thursday the company plans to challenge the law under the <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> constitutions on the grounds that the forced rollback violates the prohibition against taking property without due process The law requires insurers to cut their rates to 15 percent below the levels of July 1, 1988, on new or renewed policies, starting in October. Gov. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, who signed the rollback into law Thursday, has said he's uncertain about the measure's constitutionality. But he said Nevadans who support a rate rollback deserve a chance to have the state defend their position in court. The law allows insurance companies to raise rates only if they prove to the state insurance commissioner that they would go bankrupt without an increase. <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> has the fifth-highest auto insurance rates in the nation, with drivers paying average annual premiums of $ 880, according to the state Insurance Division. The <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> has said it also planned to challenge the rollback in court. <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Beyer </PERSON>, a spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> Farmers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, one of <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION>'s largest auto insurers, said the company has n't decided whether to challenge the rollback. He said a similar bankruptcy test in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s Proposition 103 insurance rollback was ruled unconstitutional by that state's <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> on the grounds it denied insurers a fair return on their investment `` Farmers is as concerned as anybody about containing the cost of auto insurance in <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION>, but this is simply not a workable way to solve the problem,'' <PERSON> Beyer </PERSON> said in a telephone interview from Farmers' <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> headquarters. `` You ca n't roll back prices by fiat without doing something about the underlying costs.''

<HEAD>Experts: No Jail Term For Ex-Broker May Send Wrong Message</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Sparing former stockbroker <PERSON> Boyd </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jefferies </PERSON> a prison sentence could send the wrong message to future Wall Street felons: break the law and you wo n't do time, some legal experts say. But others maintain that <PERSON> Jefferies </PERSON>, who admitted to two felony violations of federal securities laws, has more than paid his price by cooperating with government investigators and quitting the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> brokerage that bears his name. <PERSON> Jefferies </PERSON>, 58, who gave the government crucial information leading to three indictments and one conviction, was sentenced Thursday by a federal judge to five years of probation and fined $ 250,000. The sentence was only the second in the Wall Street corruption scandal triggered by infamous stock speculator <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON>, who was sentenced by the same judge to three years in prison. `` I think the public will view this as a slap on the wrist,'' said <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Bromberg </PERSON>, a securities law professor at <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Methodist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. `` I think the dividing line in the mind of the public is hard time or no hard time. `` The $ 250,000 would be a lot of money for most people, but I suspect it's not going to put <ORGANIZATION> Jefferies </ORGANIZATION> into bankruptcy court,'' he added. `` So the bottom line is nothing very serious happened to him.'' But several securities defense lawyers, including former prosecutors, said the term was appropriate, for many of the same reasons cited by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> <PERSON> Lasker </PERSON> in his sentencing. <PERSON> Lasker </PERSON> told a packed courtroom that he suspended imposition of any jail term _ which could change if <ORGANIZATION> Jefferies </ORGANIZATION> violates probation _ in large part because of <ORGANIZATION> Jefferies </ORGANIZATION>' cooperation with prosecutors. He also said that the violations to which <PERSON> Jefferies </PERSON> admitted were not as serious as <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON>'s insider trading admissions and had never been prosecuted criminally at the time of <ORGANIZATION> Jefferies </ORGANIZATION>' transgressions, in 1985 and 1986. `` The violations he pleaded to, while I would n't said they were technical, they certainly had not previously been the subject of criminal investigation,'' said securities lawyer <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Olson </PERSON>, who has reviewed insider trading legislation for the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. In addition, <PERSON> Jefferies </PERSON> did not profit personally from the schemes in which admitted a role: helping <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON> conceal ownership of $ 56 million in stock and filing a phony $ 3 million invoice to cover losses, and helping speculator <PERSON> Salim </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> manipulate the stock price of Fireman's <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> `` Basically, he was accommodating customers and that's a mitigating factor,'' said <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> securities lawyer. `` It does n't make it OK but it puts you in a different category than some of the culprits. `` <PERSON> Boyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Jefferies </PERSON> was not <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON> <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON>,'' added <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, who represented a company that owned the <ORGANIZATION> Jefferies </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> brokerage in the early 1970s. `` <PERSON> Boyd </PERSON> may have crowded the line and wandered over it when he should n't have, but I'd call <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON> a hardcore offender.'' <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON>'s three-year sentence should serve as the benchmark for other cases in which defendants reach plea agreements, lawyers said, because the degree of his crimes was so severe. `` <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON> is the crook of the century,'' said one defense lawyer involved in a prominent fraud case, speaking anonymously. <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON> paid $ 100 million to the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> and pleaded guilty to one felony count of filing false information with the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> to settle wideranging charges that he used illegally obtained inside information to trade on the stocks of potential takeover targets. <PERSON> Jefferies </PERSON>, who was implicated by <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON>, already has taken the stand at two mistrials in the <ORGANIZATION> GAF </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> stock manipulation case and the stock fraud trial of corporate raider and former Singer Co.. Chairman <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bilzerian </PERSON>, who was convicted last month He is to testify at the third <ORGANIZATION> GAF </ORGANIZATION> trial and the <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> trail in the fall. While praising <PERSON> Jefferies </PERSON> as a model of cooperation, <PERSON> Lasker </PERSON> chided `` absurd and probably obscene'' Wall Street greed and said his sentence should n't be interpreted as weak. `` It would be a great mistake ... if those of you in the audience assumed that what Mr. <PERSON> Jefferies </PERSON> has been through is easy and therefore not much of a penalty,'' the judge said.

<HEAD>EC Angry Over U.S. Decision in Soybean Dispute, Wants GATT Talks</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SALLY JACOBSEN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The European Community expressed anger after the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> ruled that the trading bloc's subsidy program for oilseed farmers hurt American exporters. `` We are very much concerned about this,'' said <PERSON> Nico </PERSON> <PERSON> Wegter </PERSON>, a spokesman for the 12-nation trade alliance. <PERSON> Wegter </PERSON> said Thursday that the community intended to ask the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade for consultations over the latest in a series of agricultural clashes between the giant trading partners. The 96-nation <ORGANIZATION> GATT </ORGANIZATION> is a forum for removing barriers to world trade. <PERSON> Carla </PERSON> <PERSON> Hills </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade representative, on Wednesday issued a ruling that the community's production and processing subsidies on oilseeds and animal feed proteins were `` unjustifiable and unreasonable and -LRB- they -RRB- burden or restrict <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. commerce.'' She delayed until the end of January taking any punitive actions in the case. The dispute stems from a complaint filed in December 1987 by the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Soybean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, which alleged the community subsidies had sharply cut into American exports to <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. The association argued that the Common Market payments encouraged farmers to grow oilseeds which then reduced the demand for American imports. The group contended <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> soybean exports fell to $ 2 billion in 1986 from $ 3.6 billion in 1981. The Common Market has argued that the erosion of the European market was largely due to increases in cheaper imports from <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>. In May, <ORGANIZATION> GATT </ORGANIZATION> set up an impartial panel to determine whether the subsidies amounted to unfair trade practices under international rules. The panel held its first meeting on June 27 and was expected to issue its findings in early January. Mrs. <PERSON> Hills </PERSON>' decision to rule in the case while the <ORGANIZATION> GATT </ORGANIZATION> panel was conducting its investigating was criticized by the Common Market. `` It is in our view contradictory,'' said <PERSON> Wegter </PERSON>. He reiterated the Common Market's contention that the subsidy program did not constitute an unfair trade practice. `` Our production is kept under strict control,'' he said. `` The prices have gone down, and it is in no way affecting imports by the Americans.'' The community provides costly subsidies to its farmers through guaranteed prices for many of their crops. It also gives exporters help so more expensive European farm products can compete with lower prices on the world market. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> complains the export subsidies have helped the community increase its share of the world market.

<HEAD>Judge Approves Ticket Refund Plan Between Eastern, Travel Agents</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-Airline Discounts, Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A plan worked out by strike-hobbled <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> and travel agents for refunding unused tickets has won the approval of a federal bankruptcy judge. The plan ties the refunds to future ticket sales by the agents. At a court hearing Thursday, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Bankruptcy Judge <PERSON> Burton </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lifland </PERSON> approved the plan agreed to by <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>, its major creditors and the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Travel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agents </ORGANIZATION>. The travel agent group earlier had petitioned the bankruptcy court to require Eastern to pay refunds on unused tickets to travel agents, who would pass the refunds on to their customers. Miami-based <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> sought bankruptcy protection from creditors on March 9, five days after the start of a crippling strike by the <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> union that was joined by pilots and flights attendants. At that time, the airline said its debts included about $ 165 million in unused tickets issued before the bankruptcy filing. That amount has since been reduced to about $ 80 million, <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> Matell </PERSON> said Thursday. Eastern estimates it sells 75 percent of its tickets through travel agents. Under Eastern's existing policy, travelers who paid cash for unused tickets must apply directly to <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> or to bankruptcy court as creditors. Those who bought tickets by credit card can apply for refunds from the card issuer. Alternatively, customers can use their tickets to fly Eastern, where available, or sister carrier <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>. Although airlines generally honor each other's tickets, competitors stopped honoring Eastern tickets after it filed for bankruptcy protection. Under the new plan, effective today, travel agents will be reimbursed for ticket refunds they gave their customers. The total amount of refund money available will be based on the volume of new Eastern tickets sold by the agents. Eastern will put $ 5 million into the reimbursement fund up front. In addition, for the rest of July, <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> will pay into the fund each week the total amount of agents' sales of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> tickets that exceeds $ 3.6 million, up to a maximum of $ 1.25 million a week. In August, the cap on the amount that could go into the fund each week will increase to $ 2 million. A maximum of $ 20 million could be put into the fund from ticket sales during the life of the program. The pilots union at <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> blasted the agreement, calling it `` nothing short of the blackmail of travel agents who are creditors in the Eastern bankruptcy.'' In a statement, the union said the agents are, in effect, required to sell <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> tickets in order to make sure they can collect the money <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> owes them. In addition, the pilots said, the plan makes no provision for customers who purchased their Eastern tickets directly, rather than through a travel agent.

<HEAD>Holiday Discount Fares Light Up Reservation Switchboards</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAY JORDEN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Airline reservation switchboards are lighting up like fireworks this week as thousands of travelers take advantage of bargain air fares that were sparked by the midweek July 4 holiday, airline officials say. <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> ignited the Independence Day fare war with its `` Spirit of'76'' ticket prices _ $ 76 one way almost anywhere the airline flies in the continental <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Rivals that matched the fare, and those that upped the ante, reported the price-slashing lit a fire under air travelers looking for bargains. The special fares are designed to drum up business during the slack midweek holiday travel period, airline officials said. `` Traditionally, when you see a holiday falling in midweek, business travelers decide not to travel that week. That is the case this week. But this is win-win situation,'' said <PERSON> Ned </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> spokesman at the airline's <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> headquarters. After Continental announced its low fares Sunday, <ORGANIZATION> Braniff </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> matched the offer the next day. Bookings at <ORGANIZATION> Braniff </ORGANIZATION> on Monday broke the airline's one-day record by about 40 percent, said spokesman <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> McGuire </PERSON>. `` The holiday weekend was extremely strong. The public response has been beautiful,'' he said in a telephone interview from <LOCATION> Braniff </LOCATION> headquarters in <LOCATION> Orlando </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> also matched the cut-rate fares Tickets for most of the special fares must be purchased by Saturday and travel must start by that day. The fares require a round-trip purchase and carry other restrictions. Most industry observers said the holiday discounts are nothing new and amounted to an excuse to advertise. But one analyst said <ORGANIZATION> Braniff </ORGANIZATION>'s program has a different intent. `` It is a typical action by an airline that is perhaps a little tight on cash,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Joedicke </PERSON>, an analyst at <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` It is an attempt to sell fares now in order to get working capital.'' The discounts are not part of a long-term trend toward lower airline fares, he said. `` The truth is, discounted fares are harder and harder to find,'' said <PERSON> Joedicke </PERSON>. <PERSON> Joedicke </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION>'s $ 76 fare, offered for such a short period, would n't make much of a difference in the airline's revenue figures. But <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> said response to <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION>'s holiday fares was so great that the airline added several thousand additional seats for the program. `` We are selling seat inventory that might otherwise go unsold, and the American consumers get a bargain they have n't seen in years,'' he said. Following Continental's lead, <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> adopted a $ 152 round-trip fare, which applies to any of the 111 markets it serves in the 48 contiguous states. The Dallas-based airline also reported its best one-day traffic period ever last Friday, when it flew 276.84 million revenue passenger miles with an 83.5 percent load factor, officials said. `` We had extremely full flights anyway'' before the fare was announced, said <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> spokesman <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION>'s similar fares extend to all cities it serves in the 48 states, said spokeswoman <PERSON> Sara </PERSON> <PERSON> Dornacker </PERSON> at the airline's <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> headquarters. `` They are selling extremely well. We are having an extremely higher period of bookings than we had last year,'' she said. As a result of existing higher demand, Atlanta-based <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lines </ORGANIZATION> decided not to match the other fares. `` We looked at our loads for those days and they were high,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Lundy </PERSON>. `` So we were looking at diluting revenue we already had on the books.''

<HEAD>Time Accuses Paramount of Trying to Deceive FCC</HEAD>

<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> lawyers have charged <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> with trying to deceive the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> about how long it would take Paramount to complete its $ 12.2 billion hostile bid for Time. The media giant's attorneys, in a letter to <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> mass media bureau chief <PERSON> Alex </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Felker </PERSON> released to the media Thursday, accused Paramount of making false statements in applications for approval of former <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Rumsfeld </PERSON> as a voting trustee to hold Time stock. Time is fighting Paramount's $ 200-a-share bid while trying to preserve a planned merger with <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. Time's lawyers charged that although <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION> told the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> it expected its original $ 10.7 billion bid to expire July 5, <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION> executives knew before their offer was announced that it could not close for several months because it is conditioned upon obtaining regulatory approval to operate about 800 cable television systems that <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> owns The offer is now scheduled to expire July 28. Paramount called the charges a delaying tactic. `` Time continues frantically to try to block our $ 200-a-share tender offer _ the only real issue in this whole matter _ by raising questions on timing,'' <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION> said in a statement. `` Of course it might take a few months to get the approvals,'' the statement continued. `` Our process is well under way.'' Paramount released a letter from its own attorneys responding to queries from the FCC. The letter, also addressed to <PERSON> Felker </PERSON>, said <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION> expects it will take `` a few months'' to obtain the cable approvals. At issue is <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION>'s request for special temporary approval for <PERSON> Rumsfeld </PERSON>, who would hold <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> stock after the conclusion of <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION>'s tender offer and while <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION> awaits approval for the transfer of licenses for microwave relay systems operated by <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION>'s cable TV subsidiary, <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION> The <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> has jurisdiction over the transfer of the relay facilities. Time's attorneys claimed in their letter that because of misrepresentations by <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION>, it would be against the public interest for the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> to grant <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION>'s requests. Along with the letter, <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> released parts of depositions given by <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION> executives. In one deposition, <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION>'s chief financial officer, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Hope </PERSON>, said he did not believe company officials gave <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION>'s board `` any reason to believe that that -LRB- July 5 -RRB- would be a realistic date to expect to close this transaction.'' Paramount criticized Time for releasing only parts of the depositions. `` The whole record should be available in this case with a few minor exceptions,'' the company said. `` Time only wants to open up for public inspection those carefully selected areas of the record they think are useful to them.'' While Time and Paramount quarreled over the trustee, the primary issue in the struggle is before <ORGANIZATION> Delaware </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chancery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, which will decide whether Time, in agreeing to merge with <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> earlier this year, in effect put itself up for sale. If the court rules that <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> did in fact put itself on the block, the media giant's board must give serious consideration to the <LOCATION> Parmount </LOCATION> offer, which <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> directors rejected as financially inadequate and too conditional. A hearing is set for Tuesday. In another courtroom, this one in <LOCATION> Stamford </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, arguments were heard Thursday in a suit brought by <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> ATC </ORGANIZATION> subsidiary that seeks an injunction to stall the Paramount bid. Paramount attorney <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Warden </PERSON> charged <ORGANIZATION> ATC </ORGANIZATION> sought the injunction merely to keep in place Time's management, `` which has negotiated extremely lucrative contracts for the next decade.'' But <ORGANIZATION> ATC </ORGANIZATION> attorney <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Stapleton </PERSON> denied the charge, saying, `` We're not trying to stop the tender offer.'' He said Paramount officials were interested only in Time and `` they do n't care about <ORGANIZATION> ATC </ORGANIZATION>.'' <ORGANIZATION> ATC </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's second-largest cable company with more than 4 million customers, wants Paramount to obtain approval as a cable television franchise owner before proceeding with a takeover. The Time subsidiary said contracts for 200 of its franchises require regulatory approval of a new parent company before the new parent company assumes control. <ORGANIZATION> ATC </ORGANIZATION> contends it could be stripped of the 200 franchises if <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION> fails to gain prior approval of its takeover bid. On Wall Street Thursday, <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> stock rose 37 -LCB- cents a share to close at $ 155.62 -LCB-. Paramount fell $ 1.50 to $ 57.87 -LCB- a share, and <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> picked up 50 cents to close at $ 61.75 a share.

 The chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> says <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>'s investigation of a foreign-exchange scandal is causing some <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> corporations to re-examine their investments in the country and to withdraw top executives. Chairman <PERSON> Dante </PERSON> <PERSON> Fascell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Fla </LOCATION>., in a letter to <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>'s ambassador in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, said: `` At a time when economic growth is a priority, it would be a shame to see foreign corporations discouraged from investing in <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION> or decide to curtail their operations `` I do not wish to interfere in any way in domestic affairs or in the judicial system in <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>; nor can I comment on the merits of the case,'' <PERSON> Fascell </PERSON> said in his June 13 letter to Ambassador <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> <PERSON> Consalvi </PERSON>. `` As a friend of <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>, however, I do wish to bring to your attention the problems this case is causing for foreign business,'' he said. `` Some <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> corporations have removed their top executives and are re-examining their investments in your country.'' <PERSON> Fascell </PERSON> said that he has been told by executives of major <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> corporations that a Venezuelan judge has issued arrest warrants for several people, including <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> executives, `` on charges of fraud in obtaining preferential foreign exchange.'' `` I understand the charges involved do not permit those accused to be granted bail,'' <PERSON> Fascell </PERSON> said. `` The executives involved claim they and their corporations are innocent.'' Replying, Ambassador <PERSON> Consalvi </PERSON> said his government `` does not welcome any discouragement to the presence of foreign businesses and investment,'' and in fact welcomes them. But he said the government, operating under a system of separation of powers, respects `` the independence of the judicial system.'' He also noted that <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION> acted in March to abolish the multiple exchange rate system. Investigators in <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION> have been examining allegations that billions of dollars in illegal profits were skimmed from a now disbanded office set up to distribute <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollars at favorable exchange rates for essential imports. The investigators have been quoted in published reports as saying that some $ 2.4 billion of the $ 30 billion involved may have been touched by fraud.

<HEAD>Larger Incentives, Lower Financing Could Be On Its Way</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FREDERICK STANDISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> DETROIT </LOCATION> _ Car buyers who resisted the incentives of this spring and summer may have their patience rewarded during the next few weeks. The scenario they've been waiting for _ high rebates and low interest rates _ may be on its way. The prime rate has dropped recently and there have been indications that other interest rates, including those for cars, will fall. `` I think there's no question that the direction of interest rates is downward,'' <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Ratajczak </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forecasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> at <ORGANIZATION> Georgia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> said Thursday. The incentives, which have been around since April, are likely to stay through the end of the model year this fall because they apparently have n't done the trick. Earlier this week, the eight major vehicle manufacturers with domestic plants reported their car and light truck sales for the first half of 1989 were 4.8 percent behind the sales pace during the same time last year. That could prompt automakers to add more incentives or beef up existing ones to move out 1989 models and clear dealer lots for the 1990s, which officially debut Oct. 1, analysts say. `` It's an incredibly good buying time,'' said auto analyst <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirnan </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Kidder </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peabody </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Co.. Inc However, he added: `` The industry is going to be very hard pressed to turn the spigot on for the third quarter. You've got the greatest levels of incentives out there and they do n't seem to be generating the interest.'' <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Meier </PERSON>, general manager of <ORGANIZATION> Ray </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Green </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chevrolet </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Jacksonville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, agreed. `` It's been slow and it's beginning to taper off,'' he said Thursday. Manufacturers and dealers are wrestling with high inventory levels, estimated by some to be as much as 80 days' worth of stock at the current selling rate. `` My guess is that the industry had 76 days -LRB- worth of cars -RRB- at the end of June, with the Big Three at 78 to 80 days,'' said analyst <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Healy </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` It's not a disaster, but it's uncomfortably high. A year ago, you were looking at 60, 61 or 62 days.'' One way to deflate inventory is to close production, drying up the supply of cars coming into the retail sales pipeline. That, in turn, forces layoffs. A <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Auto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, declining to be identified, said the union was monitoring the sales and production figures closely to be sure that any layoffs are allowed under contracts with the Big Three. Selective plant production cuts began several months ago. This week and the next kick off the traditional summer vacation and model-changeover time, as factories are prepared for the next model year. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> has no production scheduled during that time. On Thursday, <PERSON> Ward </PERSON>'s Automotive Reports said domestic automakers' production levels were sharply lower this week compared with the same week a year ago The trade journal said automakers scheduled the production of 71,167 cars and trucks in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> this week, 42.6 percent fewer than the 124,029 vehicles they produced during the same week last year.

<TEXT>
 Whether or not the first jury verdict against <ORGANIZATION> Hoffmann-La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Roche </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>'s Accutane acne medicine leads to more lawsuits will probably be irrelevant to the billion-dollar drug company, analysts say. `` There is nothing that can happen to <PERSON> Hoffmann-La </PERSON> <PERSON> Roche </PERSON> as a result of this situation,'' said <PERSON> Calvert </PERSON> <PERSON> Crary </PERSON>, a litigation analyst at <ORGANIZATION> Labe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Simpson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Co.. Inc. in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Last week, a federal jury in <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> agreed with the claim by <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Kathryn </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> that the acne medicine sent her to the hospital with bouts of disorientation, seizures and eventually comas that lasted several days. The jury awarded Ms. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>, 59, $ 1 million. Even if hundreds of people began filing such lawsuits, `` It would be a matter of utterly no consequence'' to the <LOCATION> Nutley </LOCATION>, N.J.-based drug maker, said <PERSON> Crary </PERSON>. `` In a way, I suppose you could say that's what's so sick about the whole system, but that's the system,'' he said. The powerful drug, a highly effective medicine for a severe and scarring form of acne, has been linked to 73 cases of birth defects. Its potential side effects include skin dryness, vomiting, nausea, headaches and visual disturbances. A jury in <LOCATION> Aberdeen </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Miss. </LOCATION>, found that the company failed to warn Ms. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>'s doctor adequately about Accutane's potential side effects when it was prescribed in 1984. Ms. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> at the time lived in <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Miss. </LOCATION>, and now lives outside <LOCATION> Orlando </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION> `` They're not emphasizing just how toxic this drug is,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Owens </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Tuscaloosa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ala. </LOCATION> `` We feel the verdict is wrong, that it's inappropriate,'' said company spokeswoman <PERSON> Carolyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Glynn </PERSON>. <PERSON> Hoffmann-La </PERSON> <PERSON> Roche </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> subsidiary of Swiss pharmaceutical giant <ORGANIZATION> F. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hoffmann-La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Roche </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, is considering an appeal, among other options, she said. Ms. <PERSON> Glynn </PERSON> would not comment on what those might be. Accutane is not a proven cause of the seizures, but the company in 1985 included warnings indicating that such seizures have been reported in Accutane users, she said. Analysts discounted the lawsuit avalanche common to the asbestos industry, the <LOCATION> Dalkon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Shield </LOCATION> or even, to a lesser degree, cigarette makers, who despite last year's first jury loss face fewer product liability suits. There just are n't enough potential plaintiffs, said <PERSON> Karl </PERSON> <PERSON> Habermas </PERSON>, a pharmaceutical analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Sanford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> C. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bernstein </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` I'm sure this will induce others to file suit and encourage those who have, but I do n't think there are that many people who have been injured by the product,'' he said. <PERSON> Hoffmann-La </PERSON> <PERSON> Roche </PERSON> has yearly <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> sales of $ 1.9 billion; Accutane accounts for only about $ 45 million to $ 50 million, said Ms. <PERSON> Glynn </PERSON>. Since the prescription drug's introduction in 1982, 1.4 million to 1.5 million people are estimated to have used it, she said. Insurance covers jury awards, and even without it, future cases would be `` financially insignificant,'' <PERSON> Crary </PERSON> said. Ms. <PERSON> Glynn </PERSON> said 30 to 35 Accutane cases are pending, and a somewhat greater number have been settled, thrown out of court or won by the company.

They would also be able to invest using foreign currency, the reports said. <PERSON> Enpinoza </PERSON> was quoted as saying that opening up the stock market would allow it to operate in a more sophisticated manner.

<HEAD>Boeing Looking For Cause of Crack in Older 727</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Additional inspections of older <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 727s may be ordered now that airlines have found cracks on four of the planes, according to a <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> spokesman. The <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> ordered inspections and any necessary repairs of the 47 oldest 727s after <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> reported it found a 20-inch crack in one of its airplanes during a routine maintenance check June 26. A <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said Thursday that `` tiny'' cracks have also been found on two other planes. <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> found a small crack on one plane, the <ORGANIZATION> Seattle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post-Intelligencer </ORGANIZATION> reported today. The <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> deadline for completing the inspections is July 15. It was not known how many planes had been checked so far, <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Duff </PERSON> said. He said that checks might be required on 405 other older 727 aircraft built during the early 1960s because of manufacturing processes used at the time, the <ORGANIZATION> Post-Intelligencer </ORGANIZATION> reported. `` We anticipate that we will do further airworthiness directives,'' he said. <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Rob </PERSON> <PERSON> Doughty </PERSON> said two of the three <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> planes found with cracks have been repaired and are back in service and the third will be flying shortly. The <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION>'s airworthiness directive, sent by telegram last Friday to 727 operators, said `` preliminary indications are that the cracking was caused by fatigue.'' <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> engineers are trying to discover why the 25-year-old <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> jet developed the 20-inch crack in a part of its fuselage that has n't been associated with high stress. The crack was in the same general area as the rupture in an <ORGANIZATION> Aloha </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> 737 that lost part of its top over <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> last year, but both <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> said the cracking appeared entirely different from that in the <LOCATION> Aloha </LOCATION> plane. `` This is a unique situation,'' said <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Duff </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>. `` This is the first time a report of cracking has been made in this area.'' <PERSON> Duff </PERSON> added the cracking was not typical of the type often found in older aircraft. If not corrected, the cracks in the fuselage skin could result in rapid decompression of the plane in flight, the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> said. <PERSON> Duff </PERSON> said Thursday that <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> officials suspect `` hoop tension'' fatigue, caused by outward forces against the hull in pressurized flight. The different thicknesses of aircraft skin at the overlap also could be a factor, he said. The cracked segment was brought to <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> laboratories in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> where engineers were trying to find why it occurred, said <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commercial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airplanes </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Cole </PERSON>. That analysis probably will take several days, he said. The three-engine 727, which <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> built from 1962 to 1984, was the best-selling commercial jet before being surpassed by the <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 737. <PERSON> Cole </PERSON> said 1,765 727s are still in service, including 41 of the 47 planes covered by the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> order. The April 28, 1988, <LOCATION> Aloha </LOCATION> accident, in which a stewardess fell to her death before the flight crew could land the badly damaged plane, focused worldwide attention on aging aircraft. The 19-year-old plane was one of the most heavily used 737s, with nearly 90,000 landings. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> said the probable cause of the accident was the failure of <LOCATION> Aloha </LOCATION>'s maintenance workers to detect significant disbonding and fatigue damage along the skin of the twin-engine jet. The crack in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> 727 </LOCATION> was found where sections of skin overlap on the left-hand side of the plane, ahead of the wings and below the windows, <PERSON> Duff </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> order required the removal of some seats, sidewall linings and insulation to gain access to the inside of the fuselage skin, <PERSON> Cole </PERSON> said. The inspection normally could be accomplished by several maintenance workers in an overnight check, he said. Inspections were ordered only for the 47 oldest 727s because the inner layer of aluminum skin was made thicker on later models, <PERSON> Cole </PERSON> said. He said <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION>'s decision to use the heavier-gauge skin was for cost-control, not because the skin was too thin.

<TEXT>
 The government is ordering airlines to install expensive bomb detectors at 40 American and foreign airports, but officials say it will take two to three years to put them all in place. Transportation Secretary <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> on Thursday announced draft <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> rules requiring the devices capable of detecting plastic explosives in checked luggage. The order is one of several steps taken in response to the Dec. 21 bombing of <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> Flight 103 over <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION> that killed 270 people. Investigators concluded the bomb was a plastic device hidden in luggage, although they have not determined who planted it. Screening devices currently used at airports can not detect such plastic explosives. The <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> said installation would be as fast as manufacturers can produce the detectors. Some airports will need more than one device, and installation at the first 40 airports is expected to take two to three years, said <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Leyden </PERSON>. The agency did not list all of the facilities but said international airports in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> would be the firast to get the devices. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has been considering legislation that would have the government pay for the units, which cost from $ 750,000 to $ 1 million each. Airlines say the government should pay for such extraordinary security, since the terrorist threat is aimed against the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, not the airlines. The <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION>, in making the rule that will become final at the end of August, also called for comment on whether the order should be extended to all domestic airports. The busiest <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> international airports and some major facilities used by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> carriers abroad are the first to be covered. The <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> said the first device will be installed at <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> John </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> F. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kennedy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airport </ORGANIZATION> by the end of the month A second is to be placed at <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Gatwick </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> said. Those and four others at unannounced airports are being paid for by the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> to test how the devices will be used, <PERSON> Leyden </PERSON> said. The rule does not mandate a specific device, but only one has so far been approved by the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION>: the Thermal Neutron Analysis unit manufactured by <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Applications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> TNA </ORGANIZATION> device has been `` shown to have the highest degree of explosive detection currently possible for detecting known civilian and military explosives manufactured here and abroad. Any system that qualifies, the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> said, would have to be automated, be capable of detecting defined quantities and configurations of particular explosives and be safe for operators and baggage. The <ORGANIZATION> TNA </ORGANIZATION> units are not designed for use on passengers or hand-carried bags. They bombard luggage with low-energy neutrons that interact with chemical elements in explosives, triggering an alarm when a bomb is present. Human monitoring is not required, but <PERSON> Leyden </PERSON> said details have to be worked out on what procedures will be followed after an alarm is triggered.

 <ORGANIZATION> Adolph </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> said it will offer a lower-priced beer starting Sept. 11, for the first time in its 116-year history.

<TEXT>
 The nation's unemployment rate edged up a notch to 5.3 percent in June as businesses created a modest 180,000 new jobs, the government said today in yet another sign that the economy is slowing. The civilian jobless rate was up from May's 5.2 percent, the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said. The report said the bulk of the 180,000 new non-farm jobs added last month came in the service sector, and the government revised its May job-growth total to 207,000, more than double the total given in a preliminary report last month. There were clear signs in the report of a slowing economy and an indication as well of an easing of wage inflation that has troubled some analysts. The <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said the average factory work week slipped 0.1 of an hour to 40.9 hours last month, the first time this indicator has fallen below 41 hours since September 1987. Average hourly earnings of production and supervisory workers were essentially unchanged. For the first five months of the year, hourly wages had grown on average by 0.3 percent. Many economists had expected an upward revision of the May payroll expansion totals, but the 180,000 figure for June was below most predictions. Still, it was likely not low enough to raise fears that the economy has slowed to the verge of recession. `` On balance I'd say it's another sign of a weakening economy,'' <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> analyst <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> said of the unemployment report. `` The slowdown in the industrial sector is becoming more pronounced.'' For the past four months business added an average of just below 200,000 jobs a month, well below the average monthly gain of the past year. The June unemployment report _ the first comprehensive look at economic activity last month _ showed that the service sector continues as the source of the overwhelming number of new jobs while manufacturing continues to struggle. Service-producing industries added 231,000 new jobs last month, with business and health services and wholesale and retail trade all posting modest gains. Some of that growth was offset, however, by a decline of 31,000 manufacturing jobs and 8,000 construction jobs despite the summer weather. Those figures are gleaned from the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s monthly survey of businesses. The department's separate household survey, used to set the unemployment rate, found that the civilian labor force grew by 492,000 people from May to June, to a total of 124.1 million. Of that group, 117.5 million held jobs and 6.5 million were looking for work but could not find it. <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> attributed the service-sector growth mainly to summer jobs for students. He said it appeared that <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> policymakers had eased monetary policy again Thursday for the second time in recent weeks. And he said there was nothing in today's report to change the central bank's new stance, which comes after months of keeping a tight hold on credit in hopes of curbing growth and taming inflation. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> has apparently shifted gears now and it views the risk of a recession as more pronounced than the risk of inflation,'' <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> said. Among most demographic groups, the unemployment rate was unchanged or up just slightly, although increases in joblessness were reported for teen-agers in general and black female teen-agers in particular. The rate for the latter group shot up from 28 percent in May to more than 40 percent last month. Among all teen-agers the unemployment rate rose from 15.2 percent to 15.6 percent. That came as the labor force for that age group grew by more than 100,000, apparently due to an influx of students into the summer labor market. The government said blacks made up the bulk of the new teen-agers in the labor force. In contrast to young black women, male black teen-agers had some success in finding jobs as their unemployment rate fell more than three percentage points to a still-high 33.5 percent. In a separate calculation of unemployment that includes military personnel based in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, the jobless rate climbed to 5.2 percent in June from 5.1 percent in May. The civilian jobless rate has been hovering in the 5 percent range for more than a year. It was 5.4 percent in June 1988 and fell to a more than 15-year low of 5.0 percent in March before heading upward. In its analysis of the report, the <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Statistics </ORGANIZATION> made no mention of a number of factors economists said could skew the June data, primarily a quarterly blip in the period between the survey's used to compile the report. The <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> conducts the surveys in the week of the month that includes the 12th. Those weeks usually fall four weeks apart, but four times a year _ including last month _ they come five weeks apart.

<HEAD>Experts Say Bond Rally Will Lose Steam During Second Half</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BART ZIEGLER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Bond prices rallied to a two-year high during the second quarter of the year. But economists and analysts say they are n't optimistic about the streak continuing through the rest of the year. `` Our feeling is that the bond market has overreacted,'' said <PERSON> Kathleen </PERSON> <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON>, chief economist for <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. `` It tends to get carried away at times. I think this was one of those times.'' The market rally began in late March and continued through most of the April-June quarter, pulling the yield on the bellwether 30-year <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bond from about 9.30 percent in late March to 8.03 percent on June 30. Bond prices move in the opposite direction from yields. Ms. <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> believes there will be a correction, in which bond prices will fall more in line with actual economic conditions. She says bond traders expected the economic slowdown to be greater than she predicts it actually will be. A slower economy is good for bonds because it usually eases inflation, which erodes the value of fixed-return investments such as bonds. Ms. <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> also believes bond traders expect the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> will ease monetary policy more than she thinks it actually will. The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> encourages an increase in the supply of money to stimulate the economy when it senses a downturn. More money usually translates into lower interest rates, which boost bond prices. <PERSON> Elliott </PERSON> <PERSON> Platt </PERSON>, chief economist for <ORGANIZATION> Donaldson </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lufkin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Jenrette </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, believes the bond rally has a few more months of steam left, `` but the bulk of the rally is behind us.'' He predicts the bond market would remain bullish through the current quarter because of continuing signs that the economy is slowing, which eases inflation. `` I think the long bond -LRB- the 30-year <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- is going to challenge and for a brief period break through the 8 percent mark,'' he said last week. But by year end, he predicts, the 30-year <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> will be yielding 8.50 percent. Ms. <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> was slightly more bullish, predicting the long bond would yield 8.25 percent by the end of the year. Working in favor of bond prices in the next six months, experts predict, will be an easing of monetary policy by the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>, slower economic growth and slower growth in the rate of inflation. Working against the market could be a depreciation in the dollar, which could blunt the fall in inflation and limit incentives for foreign investors to buy <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bonds, which in turn would lower demand for the securities and soften their prices. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Kochan </PERSON>, chief fixed-income strategist for <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Co.. <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, credits `` technical factors'' in part for this spring's Those factors, he said, were the popularity of zero-coupon <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bonds and long-maturity municipal bonds. As the supply of these bonds was depleted due to the demand, their prices rose, said <PERSON> Kochan </PERSON>. Zero-coupon bonds lack the interest-bearing portion of regular bonds. Demand for the zeros increased in the March-April period as reports indicated the economy was slowing, <PERSON> Kochan </PERSON> said. A similar increase in demand for long-maturity municipal bonds also pushed up their price, he said. Since then, demand for <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> zeros and long municipals has weakened, <PERSON> Kochan </PERSON> said, while the supply of these securities has increased, eliminating this as a factor in the bond market. But <PERSON> Kochan </PERSON> is more optimistic about the market's performance during the second half than <PERSON> Platt </PERSON> and Ms. <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON>. He predicts the 30-year <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bond will yield 7.75 percent by the end of the year. As to where individual investors should put their money, <PERSON> Kochan </PERSON> recommends municipal bonds with maturities of 10 years or more, as well as municipal zero-coupon bonds in this maturity range. He also suggests mortgage-backed securities. <PERSON> Platt </PERSON> cautions investors who missed the bond rally `` to be disciplined and resigned to the fact that they missed.'' He believes investors should avoid jumping into the long-maturity bond market with expectations of continued price gains. Instead, he said, they should buy shorter-duration issues, which would benefit more if the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> eases monetary policy.

 Grain and soybean futures prices were mostly lower in early trading today on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> in response to forecasts for cooler, wetter weather in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> next week. Some selling may also have reflected pre-weekend position-adjusting by traders reluctant to go home holding `` buy'' positions amid uncertainty about the weather. `` This is a very nervous market,'' said <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> Gustafson </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. Prices rallied strongly earlier in the week on predictions of an extended heat wave in the <LOCATION> Corn </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Belt </LOCATION> but some forecasters have since offered more moderate outlooks. A change to cooler, wetter weather would be particularly good for the corn crop, analysts said. Wheat futures retreated in early trading on weather forecasts favorable for winter-wheat harvesting. In early trading, wheat was 1 cent to 1 -LCB- cents lower with the contract for delivery in July at $ 4.04 a bushel; corn was 3 \ cents lower to 1 cent higher with July at $ 2.75 -LCB- a bushel; oats were unchanged to -LCB- cent lower with July at $ 1.60 a bushel; soybeans were 7 cents lower to 3 -LCB- cents higher with July at $ 7.68 -LCB- a bushel Cattle futures were mostly lower while pork futures were mixed in early trading on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. Live cattle were unchanged to .48 cent lower with August at 69.92 cents a pound; feeder cattle were unchanged to .25 cent lower with August at 81 cents a pound; live hogs were .30 cent lower to .30 cent higher with July at 47.07 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were .85 cent lower to .33 cent higher with July at 30.80 cents a pound.

 A coal company whose contract with the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> includes a no-strike clause has fired 28 wildcat strikers who refused to return to work, the first firings of the four-week wildcat walkout, officials said today. The company could n't hold a formal hearing on the firings late this morning in <LOCATION> Beckley </LOCATION>, because 2,000 <ORGANIZATION> UMW </ORGANIZATION> members blocked a meeting hall. Representatives of <PERSON> Toney </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Branch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> UMW </ORGANIZATION> refused to cross a picket line that surrounded the <LOCATION> Raleigh </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Armory. Dismissal forms given the workers said they were fired for refusing to cross pickets at <PERSON> Toney </PERSON>'s Branch's mine in <LOCATION> Racine </LOCATION>. The delay in the formal hearing does not mean the firings are postponed. `` This should tell them that all it's going to do is incite the workers,'' <ORGANIZATION> UMW </ORGANIZATION> international executive board member <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Green </PERSON> said in a telephone interview from <LOCATION> Beckley </LOCATION>. Earlier, officials at <PERSON> Toney </PERSON>'s Branch headquarters in <LOCATION> Beckley </LOCATION> refused to comment on the dismissals beyond saying the company was a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Bituminous </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Operators </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, which in February 1988 signed a <ORGANIZATION> UMW </ORGANIZATION> contract that included a no-strike clause. A coal industry manual says there are 56 employees at the <ORGANIZATION> Toney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Branch </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Racine </LOCATION> mine, but does not specify how many are <ORGANIZATION> UMW </ORGANIZATION> members. The dismissals are the first during a four-week wildcat sympathy strike by <ORGANIZATION> UMW </ORGANIZATION> members backing colleagues at the <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> who have been on strike since April. <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION>, unlike most other coal companies, has no contract with the <ORGANIZATION> UMW </ORGANIZATION>, and the union has sanctioned that strike but not the wildcat walkout at other companies. As many as 46,000 miners in 10 states have stayed off the job at one time or another since the unauthorized walkouts began June 12. Today, about 37,000 miners in eight states were off their jobs. A two-week vacation period for many miners ends at midnight Sunday and several locals have discussed or plan to consider returning to work, fearing what happened to the <PERSON> Toney </PERSON>'s Branch miners. `` Some of them think if this goes down the drain, miners might be in bad shape _ they -LRB- coal companies -RRB- might bust the union,'' said <PERSON> Charlie </PERSON> <PERSON> Greer </PERSON>, the president of a <ORGANIZATION> UMW </ORGANIZATION> local that represents <LOCATION> Zanesville </LOCATION>, Ohio-area miners. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> said Thursday he wanted <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> to step in and help end the strikes. <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON>, D-W. <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> should ask <ORGANIZATION> UMW </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Trumka </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> to settle their organizations' differences so that 1,900 striking <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> miners can return The union and the company have n't been at the bargaining table for several weeks now.

<HEAD>High Voltage Raises Offer for Universal</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MILWAUKEE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 High <ORGANIZATION> Voltage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineering </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which has been pursuing Milwaukee-based <ORGANIZATION> Universal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foods </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> since last year, announced today it was willing to raise its offer to $ 42 a share. <PERSON> Laurence </PERSON> <PERSON> Levy </PERSON>, chairman of High Voltage, based in <LOCATION> Burlington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, said his company delivered a letter to <ORGANIZATION> Universal </ORGANIZATION>'s board of directors, offering to buy the company in a negotiated transaction. `` We are attempting to negotiate with them because we think that is a better route,'' said <PERSON> Evan </PERSON> <PERSON> Zeppos </PERSON>, a spokesman for High Voltage in <LOCATION> Milwaukee </LOCATION>. High Voltage currently has a $ 38 per share cash tender offer for Universal, but only about 30 percent of the stockholders have tendered their shares, according to a statement last week from Universal. `` We remain committed to the acquisition of Universal,'' the letter from High Voltage said. `` We would like to meet with you at your earliest convenience to complete the negotiation of the merger agreement.'' A Universal spokeswoman said the company had no immediate response to the offer. High Voltage began its quest for Universal last December with an offer of $ 30.50 per share. The proposal, however, has been rejected by <ORGANIZATION> Universal </ORGANIZATION>'s board of directors. High Voltage challenged an anti-takeover law in <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> that essentially blocks bidders from making direct contact with shareholders unless the company's management approves. The law was upheld this year by the <ORGANIZATION> 7th </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, although the decision stated: `` <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>'s law may well be folly; we are confident that it is constitutional.'' In its letter to Universal, High Voltage said, `` the court noted that bidders could seek to require that directors fulfill their fiduciary obligations as they relate to the -LRB- anti-takeover -RRB- statute.'' `` I think they will find this offer very generous and it will force them to take a look at it,'' <PERSON> Zeppos </PERSON> said. Investment analysts said $ 42 per share, which would amount to about $ 640 million, would be a strong offer, but they said the outcome was hard to predict. `` I would hope the <ORGANIZATION> Universal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foods </ORGANIZATION> board would now initiate some sort of discussions,'' said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Elam </PERSON>, a food industry analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Blunt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ellis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loewi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Clinton </PERSON> <PERSON> Mayer </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Bear </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stearns </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, said he did not foresee any quick resolution. He noted that the smaller, individual stockholders have been more reluctant to part with their shares than the larger, institutional investors. `` The stock seems to be held by conservative investors who do n't seem concerned with short-term prices,'' <PERSON> Mayer </PERSON> said

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Share prices rose sharply Friday on the <ORGANIZATION> London </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, boosted by evidence of a slowing <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economy as well as a stronger British pound. The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index ended 27.9 points, or 1.29 percent, higher at 2,189.1, its best level of the day. For the week, the key index gained 38.1 points, or 1.8 percent. The narrower <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> 30-share index was up 20.3 points at 1,815.0. The Financial Times 500 closed 13.87 points higher at 1,246.12. Volume was heavy as 774.8 million shares changed hands, up sharply from 563.5 million on Thursday. However, more than a third of Friday's volume resulted from aggressive buying of shares in <ORGANIZATION> Gateway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. PLC by <ORGANIZATION> Newgateway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION>, which is bidding 2.2 billion pounds for the food retailer Share prices rose at the start of trading, helped by the activity in Gateway shares and by speculation that other companies in the food sector also could be targeted for takeover. Analysts said the advance was extended after the release of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> employment data for June, which showed growth slowing more than had been expected. Countering this, however, was an upward revision in May's pace of job growth. `` There was conflicting evidence in today's -LRB- employment -RRB- figures. But overall it's pointing to the economy slowing down,'' said one <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> dealer. Wall Street also rose briskly after a hesitant opening, further underpinning the <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> market's performance, he said. The dollar ended lower against the pound following the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> employment report, giving the British currency a chance to extend its recent gains. That eased market concerns about the outlook for British interest rates, analysts said. The pound was quoted late in the day at $ 1.6245, up from $ 1.6220 late Thursday in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>.

 The government rested its case Friday in the first securities racketeering trial after playing a tape of a former <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> trader telling a <ORGANIZATION> Princeton-Newport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partners </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> LP </ORGANIZATION> executive after an alleged illegal deal: `` Welcome to the world of being a sleaze.'' Also, defense lawyers declined Friday to cross-examine <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> Chief Executive <PERSON> Frederick </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> for fear of introducing into evidence potentially damaging information about <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION>'s $ 650 million plea deal with the government. The `` sleaze'' tape was one of 14 conversations played by federal prosecutors at the closely watched Wall Street fraud trial of five partners in <LOCATION> Princeton-Newport </LOCATION>, a defunct brokerage, and ex-Drexel trader <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Newberg </PERSON>. The tape involves charges that <PERSON> Newberg </PERSON> told <PERSON> Princeton-Newport </PERSON> to sell blocks of stock in <ORGANIZATION> C.O.M.B. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> to try to drive its share price below $ 16 in 1985 before a $ 25 million <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> bond offering to the Minneapolis-based merchandiser. `` I want you to, you know, get rid of it,'' <PERSON> Newberg </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> Princeton-Newport </ORGANIZATION> partner <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Zarzecki </PERSON> on April 11, 1985. `` I want you to get it down to at least 15 -RCB- at least, and hopefully lower.'' <PERSON> Zarzecki </PERSON> later that day told <PERSON> Newberg </PERSON> he sold 40,000 shares of the stock through another party in an attempt to drive the price down. <PERSON> Newberg </PERSON>: `` Agreed, uh, that was good. ... You're a sleaze bag.'' <PERSON> Zarzecki </PERSON>: `` You taught me man. ... Hey, listen turkey.'' <PERSON> Newberg </PERSON>: `` Welcome to the world of being a sleaze.'' After playing the tape to the jury of nine women and three men, prosecutors rested their case. <PERSON> Zarzecki </PERSON>'s lawyer, <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Grand </PERSON>, told <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> that certain charges against his client should be dismissed because <ORGANIZATION> C.O.M.B. </ORGANIZATION>'s stock never fell below $ 16. Grand said disclosure of the transaction was unnecessary because the stock was traded in the over-the-counter market, which is governed by different rules than major exchanges. Other defense lawyers asked <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> to throw out a bevy of mail fraud, wire fraud and racketeering charges. The judge did not immediately rule on the requests, but indicated he was uncertain about some of the government's charges. The C.O.M.B. deal also played a major role in defense lawyers' decision not to cross-examine <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON>, who took the stand Thursday for the first time in a Wall Street corruption case Under questioning from Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Hansen </PERSON>, <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> described <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> compliance systems and practices for underwriting securities such as convertible bonds, the kind used in the C.O.M.B. transaction. Defense lawyers said Friday that cross-examining <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> in an attempt to show that the C.O.M.B. transactions were harmless could have opened the door for the government to introduce <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION>'s $ 650 settlement of securities law charges reached last December. The government is barred from introducing the <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> deal as evidence because it is unrelated. Defense lawyers did not want to risk mentioning the deal because for fear it would have prejudiced the jury against Princeton-Newport. One of six felony counts to which <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> has agreed to plead guilty involved the C.O.M.B. transaction. In addition to <PERSON> Newberg </PERSON> and <PERSON> Zarzecki </PERSON>, on trial are <PERSON> Princeton-Newport </PERSON> partners <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Sutton </PERSON> <PERSON> Regan </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Z. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabinowitz </PERSON> and <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Berkman </PERSON>, and the firm's controller, <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Smotrich </PERSON>. The case overlaps the government's 98-count fraud and racketeering indictment of former <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> financier <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Milken </PERSON>. Much of the same evidence is expected to be introduced at <PERSON> Milken </PERSON>'s trial, scheduled to begin in March 1990 Princeton-Newport, a small securities firm with offices in <LOCATION> Princeton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Newport </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, went out of business after the indictment was brought last August. Neither Princeton-Newport nor <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> is charged in the case.

 The stock market jumped ahead today, posting its fourth straight gain amid increasing hopes for further declines in interest rates. The market opened on a hesitant note, but then picked up steam at midsession as traders concluded that the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> apparently had been encouraged to relax its credit policy by the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s employment data for June. The report showed an increase of 180,000 in nonfarm payroll employment, below most advance estimates. The figures for May were revised to show a gain of 207,000, more than double the 101,000 originally reported a month ago. Still, brokers said, Wall Streeters came increasingly to believe that the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> interpreted the data as reason enough to ease up on its credit restraints. Interest rates fell in the credit markets. Prices of long-term <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bonds rose more than $ 5 for each $ 1,000 in face value, reducing their yields to the 8.03 percent-8 .06 percent range

 Grain and soybean futures prices closed mostly lower Friday on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>, reflecting an increased likelihood of rain in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> this weekend and late next week. Prices had opened higher on forecasts Thursday for mostly hot and dry weather in the <LOCATION> Corn </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Belt </LOCATION> through next week.

 The Federal Reserve, faced with further signs of a weakening economy, launched a second round of credit easing this week even before the end of a crucial midyear review of monetary policy, private economists said Friday. The analysts predicted that the move would send a variety of consumer and business interest rates lower, with one saying that a cut in commercial bank's prime lending rate could come as early as Monday. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> is easing and there is clear evidence that we have passed the peak on interest rates,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Wyss </PERSON>, an economist with <PERSON> DRI-McGraw </PERSON> <PERSON> Hill </PERSON>, an economic consulting firm in <LOCATION> Lexington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass </LOCATION>. The development was not unexpected, although some economists were surprised that the move came even before the end of two days of meetings of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Open </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Market </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, composed of members of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and five of the 12 regional <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> bank presidents. The committee meets eight times a year to map monetary strategy and many had expected that the central bank would begin another round of easing moves in the period following this week's meeting. At the previous meeting, held on May 16, <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> policy-makers decided to leave credit conditions unchanged. They noted a variety of economic statistics pointing to slower growth, according to minutes of that meeting released Friday. The `` no-change'' decision was adopted on an 11-1 vote with <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Melzer </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Louis </ORGANIZATION>, dissenting. <PERSON> Melzer </PERSON> argued that unless the central bank eased immediately it ran the danger of increasing the possibility of a recession. <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> will reveal details of this week's discussions when he delivers the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>'s midyear assessment of the economy in congressional testimony on July 20. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, an economist with <ORGANIZATION> Aubrey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> G. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lanston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, a government securities dealer, said the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> is acting because a growing number of business barometers confirm that economic growth is slowing. The <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> reported Friday that the nation's unemployment rate climbed to 5.3 percent in June, reflecting continued declines in manufacturing and construction The uptick in the jobless rate follows other statistics showing weak auto sales, a plunge in orders for manufactured goods and lackluster retail sales. <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> said he expected the looser credit environment would mean that banks will cut their prime lending rate, perhaps as early as Monday. Banks dropped the prime to its current 11 percent in early June. The prime rate, traditinally considered a benchmark for business loans, now influences a variety of consumer loans, including home equity loans. Economists based their belief that the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> is easing credit on a slight decline in the federal funds rate, which edged down 0.25 percent to 9.25 percent in the past two days. The federal funds rate, the interest that banks charge each other to make overnight loans, is influenced by daily decisions the central bank makes on how much money to make available to the banking system. It is considered the best early-warning signal of <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> intentions to loosen or tighten credit conditions. The funds rate first dropped on Thursday to the 9.25 percent level and it held at that lower level on Friday, convincing many economists that the central bank had eased. It would mark the second move toward lower interest rates in recent weeks. The funds rate had dropped from 9.75 percent to 9.5 percent in early June. <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> and the other members of the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> have been under pressure from <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the administration to let interest rates fall as a way of keeping the economy out of a recession. The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> has been struggling to engineer a soft-landing where growth slows enough to dampen inflationary pressures but without a recession. <PERSON> Wyss </PERSON> said he believed the odds were still 2-1 that the central bank would be successful in avoiding a recession this year. `` The Fed seems to be on track for a soft-landing,'' <PERSON> Wyss </PERSON> said. He said Friday's unemployment report was particularly encouraging because it showed that average hourly earnings, a good barometer of wage pressures, showed only a moderate increase last month.

 Visions of renewed declines in interest rates provided the inspiration for a broad advance in the stock market Friday. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials climbed 25.42 points to 2,487.86, stretching its advance for a holiday-shortened week of four consecutive gains to 47.80 points. Issues rising in price outnumbered losers by more than 2 to 1 in nationwide trading of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> Exchange-listed stocks, with 1,064 up, 472 down and 458 unchanged. Volume on the floor of the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> came to 166.43 million shares, up from 140.45 million in the previous session. Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter market, totaled 195.24 million shares. The market opened on a hesitant note, but then picked up steam at midsession as traders concluded that the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s employment report for June had apparently encouraged the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> to relax its credit policy The report showed an increase of 180,000 in nonfarm payroll employment, below most advance estimates. The figures for May were revised to show a gain of 207,000, more than double the 101,000 originally reported a month ago. Still, brokers said, Wall Streeters came increasingly to believe that the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> interpreted the data as reason enough to ease up on its credit restraints. Interest rates fell in the credit markets. Prices of long-term <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bonds rose more than $ 5 for each $ 1,000 in face value, reducing their yields to the 8.03 percent-8 .06 percent range That helped fuel speculation that major banks might soon announce new reductions in their prime lending rates. Gainers among the blue chips included <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Telegraph </ORGANIZATION>, up -LCB- at 35 ~; <ORGANIZATION> Coca-Cola </ORGANIZATION>, up 1 -LCB- at 58 -RRB-; <ORGANIZATION> Philip </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morris </ORGANIZATION>, up | at 141 -LRB-; <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION>, up 1 at 53 |, and <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machines </ORGANIZATION>, up -LCB- at 112 An exception was <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION>, down -RCB- at 40 -LRB- on word of new cutbacks in the company's production plans for the third quarter. <ORGANIZATION> Honeywell </ORGANIZATION> climbed 4 | to 77 -RCB- on takeover speculation fueled by a column in Business Week magazine <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION>, also buffeted by continuing takeover rumors, jumped 13 -LCB- to 166. Among other leading airline issues, <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lines </ORGANIZATION> gained 1 ~ to 72 and <ORGANIZATION> AMR </ORGANIZATION> was up \ at 64 As measured by <ORGANIZATION> Wilshire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION>' index of more than 5,000 actively traded stocks, the market increased $ 30.43 billion, or 0.96 percent, in value. The <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION>'s composite index of all its listed common stocks gained 1.74 to 181.56. <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Poor's industrial index rose 3.68 to 370.87, and <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; P's 500-stock composite index was up 3.36 at 324.91 The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market added 2.85 to 442.42. At the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, the market value index closed at 363.75, up 2.64.

<TEXT>
 Six of the 10 richest people in the world are Japanese but the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> still leads the world in the total number of billionaires, according to estimates compiled by Forbes magazine. For the third year running, <PERSON> Yoshiaki </PERSON> <PERSON> Tsutsumi </PERSON> led <PERSON> Forbes </PERSON>' list of private billionaires even though his wealth was n't quite as much as it had been 12 months earlier. <PERSON> Tsutsumi </PERSON>, head of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Seibu </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Railway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, has a personal net worth of at least $ 15 billion, over $ 3 billion less than estimated last summer due mainly to a rise in the dollar against other major currencies, <PERSON> Forbes </PERSON> said Sunday. The estimate was far greater than that made by Fortune magazine in its September 1988 ranking of those it considered the world's richest people _ which valued <PERSON> Tsutsumi </PERSON>'s holdings at a mere $ 2.8 billion In last year's list, <ORGANIZATION> Forbes </ORGANIZATION> estimated <PERSON> Tsutsumi </PERSON>'s net worth was $ 18.9 billion. The magazine reports in its July 24 issue that <PERSON> Tsutsumi </PERSON> edged out second-ranked Taikichiro Mori by less than $ 1 billion. <PERSON> Mori </PERSON>, a former economics professor who owns 72 office buildings in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, has an estimated net worth of $ 14.2 billion. In last year's survey, <PERSON> Forbes </PERSON> placed <PERSON> Mori </PERSON>'s worth at about $ 18 billion. The third-richest on the list was American <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> <PERSON> Walton </PERSON>, founder of the third largest retailer in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Wal-Mart </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Walton </PERSON> and his family are worth an estimated $ 8.7 billion, up from <ORGANIZATION> Forbes </ORGANIZATION>' 1988 estimate of $ 6.5 billion After the <ORGANIZATION> Waltons </ORGANIZATION> came <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Reichmann </PERSON> brothers, owners of the <ORGANIZATION> Olympia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; York real estate empire, with a combined net worth of about $ 8 billion. The rest of the 10 richest people in the world, their country and industries, according to <PERSON> Forbes </PERSON>, were: <PERSON> Shin </PERSON> <PERSON> Kyuk-ho </PERSON>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, candy, real estate; <PERSON> Hirotomo </PERSON> <PERSON> Takei </PERSON> and family, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, publishing, real estate; <PERSON> Kitaro </PERSON> <PERSON> Watanabe </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, real estate, hotels; <PERSON> Haruhiko </PERSON> <PERSON> Yoshimoto </PERSON> and family, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, real estate; <PERSON> Hans </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gad </PERSON> <PERSON> Rausing </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>, liquids packaging; and <PERSON> Eitaro </PERSON> <PERSON> Itoyama </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, land. <PERSON> Forbes </PERSON> said it identified 226 individuals or families around the world with personal assets worth over $ 1 billion. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was the country with the most billionaires, with 55 individuals qualifying for that title. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> ranked second, with 41, and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> was third with 20. American also accounted for the most billionaires in the 1988 survey, with 47 individuals, followed by <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s 32 and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s 16. Among the richest of the world's rich were people who did n't necessarily come by their money in an honest way <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s cocaine barons, for instance, are still putting away piles of money from selling the illegal drug even though profit margins in the cocaine trade have been shrinking during recent years. Three of them made <ORGANIZATION> Forbes </ORGANIZATION> `` World Billionaires'' list including <PERSON> Pablo </PERSON> <PERSON> Escobar </PERSON> <PERSON> Gaviria </PERSON>, leader of the notorious <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> cocaine cartel, with an estimated personal net worth of $ 3 billion. The other cocaine kingpins on the list were the <PERSON> Ochoa </PERSON> family, worth more than $ 2 billion, and <PERSON> Gonzalo </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> <PERSON> Gacha </PERSON>, with more than $ 1 billion. In compiling its list, <PERSON> Forbes </PERSON> does not consider royal families and heads of state in compiling its list of wealthy people and individuals `` because their wealth derives more from political heritage than from economic effort _ theirs are feudal fortunes, not capitalistic ones.'' The magazine also excludes dictators, such as <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Fidel </PERSON> <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> or <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Il </PERSON> <PERSON> Sung </PERSON>.

<HEAD>Wilkinson Sword Barred From Showing Ultra Glide Ads</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A federal judge Friday temporarily barred <ORGANIZATION> Wilkinson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sword </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> from airing television commercials for its new Ultra Glide razor. The preliminary injunction was sought by the <ORGANIZATION> Gillette </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, which sued <PERSON> Wilkinson </PERSON> for false advertising in May. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Kimba </PERSON> <PERSON> Wood </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> said <ORGANIZATION> Gillette </ORGANIZATION> was `` likely to succeed on the merits'' of its allegations that the commercials misled the public by implying Ultra Glide's shavers were six times smoother than <ORGANIZATION> Gillette </ORGANIZATION>'s product, Atra Plus. In the ads, Atlanta-based <PERSON> Wilkinson </PERSON> says Ultra Glide's special lubricating strip provided a smoother shave than a similar strip on Atra Plus. <PERSON> Wood </PERSON>'s ruling reversed a written opinion she made Thursday rejecting <ORGANIZATION> Gillette </ORGANIZATION>'s request for the preliminary injunction that would bar <PERSON> Wilkinson </PERSON> from showing the television commercials. She said she reconsidered after reviewing a market study that found no substantial differences in the smoothness of the two shaving systems. A <PERSON> Wilkinson </PERSON> attorney, <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Levitsky </PERSON>, asked for a stay of the order because he said its effect would be `` devastating'' to the company. The commercials are the only television advertising <PERSON> Wilkinson </PERSON> is currently showing, he said. <PERSON> Wilkinson </PERSON> is a small player in the $ 750 million wet-shave razor market with about a 4 percent share, compared with more than 60 percent for <ORGANIZATION> Gillette </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Wood </PERSON> declined to stop the injunction, which will be in effect until the case is resolved. A trial date could be set for later this summer. Boston-based <ORGANIZATION> Gillette </ORGANIZATION> is seeking undetermined monetary damages.

<HEAD>Dollar Falls Amid Fears of Interest Rate Cuts</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: SUBS 8th graf pvs, Rumors circulated... to CORRECT to ``reduce''

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The dollar finished lower against all major currencies except the Japanese yen Friday after a steady selloff sparked by fears that interest rates would decline. Gold prices also lost ground. On the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, gold bullion for current delivery slipped to $ 383.60 a troy ounce from $ 386.40 on Thursday. <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> quoted a late bid for gold of $ 382.00 an ounce as of 4 p.m. EDT, down from Thursday's late bid of $ 384.25. Domestic currency trading began with a jolt as the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> issued a report showing the nation's unemployment rate climbed 0.1 percent to 5.3 percent last month. Traders initially were confused by the specifics of the report, which showed lower-than-expected non-farm payroll growth coupled with a sharply higher revision for May.Non-farm businesses added just 180,000 jobs last month, but May's payroll expansion was revised upward to 207,000 jobs. `` The first reaction was the dollar went up,'' said <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawrie </PERSON>, vice president and manager at <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> office. `` But that only lasted five minutes before the dollar came barreling off,'' he said. The report ultimately depressed the dollar by serving as yet another example of the economy's slowdown. Traders said the dollar remained under pressure from the fundamental threat it has faced throughout the week: the prospect of lower interest rates. Dollar-denominated securities like bonds are more expensive when interest rates edge lower, which depresses the need for dollars to purchase them. Rumors circulated through the market that the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> may be preparing to reduce its discount rate before the weekend. `` We got a lot of -LRB- dollar -RRB- selling this afternoon,'' said <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Flanagan </PERSON>, a vice president at <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hanover </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Flanagan </PERSON> did not attribute the selloff solely to the unemployment report, however He stressed instead that the report `` set the stage for upcoming statistics due out next week'' by suggesting that further weakness in the economy is likely. The government is scheduled to report on industrial production, factory use and retail sales next week. Each bearish report gives the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> a greater incentive to trim interest rates. Earlier in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, the dollar closed at 139.65 Japanese yen, up from 138.90 yen. Later in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, the dollar inched up to 139.75 yen.

<HEAD>Bond Prices Climb</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Bond prices climbed Friday, pushed up by June employment data that provided more evidence of a slowing economy. The <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION>'s closely watched 30-year bond rose about 21-32 point, or $ 6.50 for every $ 1,000 in face value. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from price, declined to 8.03 from 8.09 percent late Thursday. The <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> reported that the nation's unemployment rate edged up to 5.3 percent in June from 5.2 percent in May as businesses created a modest 180,000 new jobs. There were signs in the report that economic growth is cooling and an indication as well of an easing of the wage inflation that has troubled some analysts. <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Vanden </PERSON> <PERSON> Houten </PERSON>, money-market economist for <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Capital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Markets </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, said the increases in non-farm payroll and hourly earnings were below market expectations. `` The consensus was about 225,000 and there was only a one-cent increase in hourly earnings,'' she said. `` The market for a long time has been focusing on signs of inflation. That definitely was positive news in terms of inflation.'' Average hourly earnings of production and supervisory workers were essentially unchanged, after rising an average 0.3 percent in the first five months of the year, the government said. The report was one of many in recent weeks that suggested the economy is easing off its brisk pace of the last several years and underscored a widely-held belief that the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> might now allow short-term interest rates to decline. <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldinger </PERSON>, a principal at the investment firm <ORGANIZATION> Capital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insight </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Beverly </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, said despite the gains market activity was volatile in thin dealings as traders anticipated the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>'s next move. `` Some investors did n't know what to do with the -LRB- employment -RRB- numbers,'' <PERSON> Goldinger </PERSON> said. `` The market was confused over whether the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> would ease. That caused the bond market to be more volatile than usual.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> has kept a tight grip on credit by encouraging higher interest rates in recent months in hopes of curbing growth and taming inflation. Inflation erodes the value of fixed-income securities such as bonds and notes. Higher interest rates also depress bond prices. Market observers noted on Thursday that the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> had eased policy as indicated by a declining federal funds rate and the fact that the central bank had not drained reserves from the banking system. In the secondary market for <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> securities, prices of short-term government issues rose between 3-16 point and 7-32 point, intermediate maturities gained between 7-32 point and \ point and 20-year issues advanced between 11-32 point and 19-32 point, according to <ORGANIZATION> Telerate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a financial information service. The movement of a point is equivalent to a change of $ 10 in the price of a bond with a $ 1,000 face value. The <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> Bond Index, which measures price movements on all outstanding <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> issues with maturities of a year or longer, rose 3.31 to 1,190.16. In corporate trading, industrials rose. <ORGANIZATION> Moody </ORGANIZATION>'s Investment Grade Corporate Bond Index, which measures total return on a portfolio of 80 corporate bonds with maturities of five years or longer, gained 0.97 to 328.76. In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively traded municipal bonds closed at 94 11-16, up 3-16 from Thursday. The average yield to maturity slipped to 7.19 percent from 7.20 percent late Thursday. Yields on three-month <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bills fell to 7.96 percent as the discount dropped 8 points to 7.71 percent. Yields on six-month bills declined to 7.86 percent as the discount tumbled 7 basis points to 7.47 percent. Yields on 1-year bills fell to 7.86 percent as the discount slid 8 basis basis points to 7.33 percent. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. The yield is the annualized return on an investment in a <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bill. The discount is the percentage that bills are selling below the face value, which is paid at maturity. The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between banks, was quoted late in the day at 8 ~ percent, down from 9 5-16 percent late Thursday

<HEAD>Appeals Court Rebuffs FCC on State Oversight of Telephone Wiring</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAY ARNOLD</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A federal appeals court Friday rebuffed an attempt by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> to revoke state oversight of on-premise telephone wiring and maintenance. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION>, ruling on a complaint by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regulatory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Utility </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commissioners </ORGANIZATION>, said the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> could step into matters of state telephone regulation only when state rules interfere with the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION>'s regulation of interstate phone service The court found that the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> in 1987 exceeded its authority when it pre-empted state regulation of the `` inside wiring'' business _ the on-premise wiring that connects residential and single-line business customers to the telephone network. The court said the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> may pre-empt state authority only `` to the degree necessary to keep such regulation from negating the commission's exercise of its lawful authority over interstate communication service.'' The court ordered the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> to reconsider the inside wiring matter. The opinion was written by Circuit Judge <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Buckley </PERSON>, and was joined by Judges <PERSON> Spottswood </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> and <PERSON> Abner </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mikva </PERSON>. However, the court agreed with the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> that the commission may proscribe state regulations that would result in the subsidization of the installation and maintenance of inside wiring by the general ratepayers because it would allow the phone companies to undercut competition. The court said the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> may, for example, force states to separate the costs of installation and maintenance from basic telephone service rates. The <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> had ordered that inside wiring installation and maintenance be deregulated and that phone companies be relieved of the requirement to install and maintain such wiring. The <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> said individual customers should pay for their own installation and maintenance and that such costs should not be absorbed into basic telephone service charges. The commission reasoned that deregulation would stimulate new competition and create a market for `` do-it-yourself'' kits, and thus lead to savings for customers. Under the 1934 Communications Act, the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> regulates interstate telephone service and states have authority over intrastate phone service. But in its deregulation order, the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> said it must pre-empt state authority over inside wiring. The commission argued that a federal program of competitive, deregulated inside wiring could not coexist with a regulated state system unless consumers were required to purchase two sets of inside wiring _ one for interstate and the other for intrastate use. The <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> also said inside wiring was not a `` common carrier'' telephone company service and therefore was not subject to state regulation. <ORGANIZATION> NARUC </ORGANIZATION> and a host of state utility commissions challenged the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> order, saying states should have the right to require phone companies to be inside wiring installers of last resort and that do-it-yourself kits are not an acceptable substitute for a trained installer.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> engineers on Thursday were trying to determine why an aging <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> 727 developed a 20-inch crack in a part of its fuselage. The split was in the same general area as the rupture in an <ORGANIZATION> Aloha </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> 737 that lost part of its roof over <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> last year. However, both <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, said the cracking appeared entirely different from that in the Aloha plane. `` This is a unique situation,'' said <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Duff </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>. `` This is the first time a report of cracking has been made in this area.'' <PERSON> Duff </PERSON> added the cracking was not typical of the type often found in older aircraft, in which tiny cracks tend to form along lines of rivet holes where sections of the plane's skin overlap. The <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> ordered inspections and any necessary repairs of the 47 oldest 727s after the crack was discovered by <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> inspectors during a routine maintenance check June 26 at <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Stapleton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airport </ORGANIZATION>. United immediately notified the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> and the 25-year-old plane was repaired and placed back in service, said <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Rob </PERSON> <PERSON> Doughty </PERSON>, at the airline's headquarters in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. The plane, delivered in February 1964 to <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION>, was the 23rd 727 built, said <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commercial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airplanes </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Cole </PERSON>. It had 46,587 landings, a number he characterized as `` not overly high.'' Airlines have reported three more planes with similar cracks since the inspections began, bringing the total to four, <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Duff </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> KIRO </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Doughty </PERSON> said the new cracks were `` minor'' compared with the 20-inch crack that led to the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> order but were in the same general area. `` They are similar but much smaller cracks,'' he said. Operators of the 727s have until July 15 to complete the inspections. <PERSON> Duff </PERSON> said it was not known how many planes have been checked so far. Preliminary indications are that the cracking in the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> 727 was caused by metal fatigue, according to an airworthiness directive the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> telegraphed to 727 operators last week. Without corrective measures, cracks in the fuselage skin could result in rapid decompression of the plane in flight, the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> said. The cracked segment was brought to <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> laboratories in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>, where engineers were trying to understand why it occurred, <PERSON> Cole </PERSON> said. Analysis probably will take several days, he said. The three-engine 727, which <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> built from 1962 to 1984, was the best-selling commercial jet before being surpassed by the <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 737. <PERSON> Cole </PERSON> said 1,765 727s are still in service, including 41 of the 47 planes covered by the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> order. Operators of the 41 planes were to make the inspections and report back to the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> within 15 days, <PERSON> Duff </PERSON> said. The April 28, 1988, <LOCATION> Aloha </LOCATION> accident, in which a flight attendant fell to her death before the crew could land the badly damaged plane, focused worldwide attention on aging aircraft. The 19-year-old 737 flown by <PERSON> Aloha </PERSON> was one of the most heavily used 737s in existence, with nearly 90,000 landings. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> said the probable cause of the accident was the failure of <LOCATION> Aloha </LOCATION>'s maintenance workers to detect significant disbonding and fatigue damage along the skin of the twin-engine jet.

 Silver futures prices fell sharply Friday on <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, partly reflecting the movement of investment dollars out of precious metals and into the stock market. Gold futures also settled lower while copper made strong gains. On other markets, coffee futures sank; oil futures rose; grains and soybeans were lower; and livestock and meat mostly fell. Silver settled 16.8 cents to 19.1 cents lower with the contract for delivery in July at at $ 5.209 a troy ounce; gold was $ 2.80 to $ 3.90 lower with August at $ 385.70 a troy ounce. Analysts cited a variety of reasons for silver's decline, including the dollar's recent volatility and disappointment over the metal's failure to rally as strongly as gold in the past two weeks. <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>, a metals trader for <ORGANIZATION> Deak </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, pointed to the stock market's strong advance Friday as a key to silver's decline. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials climbed 25.42 points to 2,487.86, stretching its gain for the week to 47.80 points. `` I think the big rally in stocks today indicated there was a return to be made over there, so you saw money flowing out of the precious metals and into stocks,'' <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> said. Gold's losses were less severe. <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> said silver has been a more volatile market than gold during the last two years and that ample supplies of silver make its price more prone to retreats than rallies. Copper futures rose on the <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> following an exchange report that its tally of warehouse stocks of copper had fallen Thursday by 843 tons, to 21,532 tons. A threatened strike by workers at the <LOCATION> Highland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> copper mine in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> also supported the market. Copper settled 3.1 cents to 3.7 cents higher with July at $ 1.033 a pound. Coffee futures dropped to new 8-year lows on <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s Coffee, <ORGANIZATION> Sugar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Cocoa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> on continuing fears that producers will flood the market with coffee following the suspension of export quotas Tuesday by the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coffee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, a price-support group. The fears were fanned by reports that officials in <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>, the world's largest coffee producer, had removed volume restrictions on registrations for coffee exports and slashed the coffee export tax in half, to 6 percent. `` They basically are saying to exporters: ` Let's push the coffee out, let's move it, let's sell it,''' said <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Badenhop </PERSON>, a coffee-market analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Capital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Markets </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Coffee settled 1.75 cents to 4.88 cents lower with July at 88.50 cents a pound. Oil futures rallied on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> on news that dockworkers in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> had voted to strike at 40 ports beginning Tuesday. West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 4 cents to 45 cents higher with August at 20.75 cents a pound; heating oil was .08 cent to .12 cent lower with August at 49.77 cents a pound; unleaded gasoline was .18 cent to .32 cent higher with August at 56.59 cents a pound. Grain and soybean futures ended mostly lower on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>, reflecting an increased likelihood of rain in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> this weekend and late next week. Wheat settled \ cent to 5 cents lower with July at $ 4.04 -RCB- a bushel; corn was 3 \ cents to 4 -RCB- cents lower with July at $ 2.74 a bushel; oats were 1 -RCB- cents to 4 cents lower with July at $ 1.57 -RCB- a bushel; soybeans were 15 -LCB- cents lower to 1 -LCB- cents higher with July at $ 7.66 -LCB- a bushel Most pork futures retreated, although prices for near-month deliveries advanced, in a continued reaction to a recent quarterly <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> report showing a larger <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> hog herd than traders had expected. Cattle futures fell in a late flurry of selling amid expectations for lower spot-market prices next week. Live cattle were .20 cent to .65 cent lower with August at 69.75 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .05 cent to .35 cent lower with August at 80.82 cents a pound; live hogs were .48 cent lower to .38 cent higher with July at 47.15 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were 1.72 cent lower to .38 cent higher with July at 30.85 cents a pound.

 <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> said Friday it had received financing commitments from 40 banks for its $ 14 billion tender offer for <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. Time, which is pursuing a merger with <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> and trying to fend off an unwanted $ 12.2 billion bid from <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, said the banks offered to provide a total of $ 27.5 billion in financing The media giant has said it needs $ 8.35 billion to complete the cash portion of its offer for <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION>. Time is offering $ 70 a share in cash for half of <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION>'s 200 million outstanding shares, and will exchange cash and securities worth $ 70 a share for the remaining 100 million shares. The announcement came as lawyers prepared for a hearing in <ORGANIZATION> Delaware </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chancery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday that could determine the outcome of the three-way struggle for Time. Chancery Court Judge <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> will hear arguments on <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION>'s contention that Time, in agreeing to a friendly stock-swap merger with <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> earlier this year, put itself up for sale and therefore must seriously consider the $ 200 a share <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION> offer. The Time board rejected the <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION> offer as financially inadequate and too dependent on conditions to be viable. Time stock fell $ 4.12 -LCB- a share to $ 151.50 in <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> composite trading Friday. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Appert </PERSON>, an analyst with <PERSON> C.J </PERSON>. <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Morgan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Grenfell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, said traders were growing increasingly nervous about <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION>'s chances of success as Tuesday's hearing drew closer. Time stock has traded as high has $ 182.75 in the month since Paramount announced its offer, but has fallen back as some investors, fearing the hostile bid will fail, have taken profits. <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> stock was unchanged Friday, closing at $ 61.75 a share, while <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION> stock slipped 87 -LCB- cents to $ 57 a share. Time said it had designated <ORGANIZATION> Bankers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hanover </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Morgan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guaranty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> as co-agents to coordinate the financing for the <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> bid.

Last week, <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION> announced it had lined up seven banks to serve as co-agents for its offer for Time. Paramount said each of the banks would contribute $ 1 billion, or a total of $ 7 billion, toward the $ 15.6 billion estimated financing costs for the bid, although <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION> did not yet have commitments for the rest of the money.

<HEAD>FAA Considering More Inspections of Older 727s</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> may order inspections of more older <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 727 jetliners as a precaution after cracks were found in the fuselages of three 727s flown by <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, an <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said Friday. Spokesman <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Duff </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> officials were considering requiring inspections on approximately 400 of the three-engine jets built by The <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in the late 1960s. No cracks have been reported among those jets, and any inspection would be `` purely a precautionary and prudent measure by the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Duff </PERSON> said. If not corrected, the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> said, the cracks could lead to sudden decompression of the aircraft cabin. The <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> ordered inspections and any necessary repairs of the 47 oldest 727s after <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> found a 20-inch crack in a 25-year-old jet during a June 26 maintenance check. <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Rob </PERSON> <PERSON> Doughty </PERSON> said tiny cracks were found on the two other 727s after the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> issued its airworthiness directive June 30. All three planes have been repaired, <PERSON> Doughty </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> has 16 jets that required inspection, and the checks were being completed Friday night, he said. <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> said 41 of the 47 planes are still in service. Among other carriers flying them are <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, with two planes, <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION>, with three, <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, with seven, and Trump Shuttle, with one. Spokesmen for those companies said most of the planes had been inspected, with no cracks found. The <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> deadline for completing the inspections is July 15. <PERSON> Duff </PERSON> said he had not received an official report of how many planes had been checked. The 20-inch crack was in the same general area as the break in an <ORGANIZATION> Aloha </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> 737 that lost part of its top over <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> last year, but <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> said the cracking appeared to be entirely different. `` This is the first time a report of cracking has been made in this area,'' <PERSON> Duff </PERSON> said, adding that the cracking was not typical of the type often found in older aircraft. <PERSON> Duff </PERSON> said Thursday <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> officials suspect `` hoop tension'' fatigue, caused by outward forces in pressurized flight against the different thicknesses of aircraft skin where skin sections overlap. The cracked segment was brought earlier this week to <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> laboratories in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> where engineers are trying to find out why it occurred. <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commercial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airplanes </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Gamble </PERSON> said Friday it probably would take about a week for the analysis to be completed. The three-engine 727, built from 1962 to 1984, was the best-selling commercial jet before being surpassed by the <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 737. <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> said 1,765 of the 727s are still in service.

 The Federal Reserve, faced with further signs of a weakening economy, launched a second round of credit easing this past week even before the end of a crucial midyear review of monetary policy, private economists said. The analysts predicted Friday that the move would send a variety of consumer and business interest rates lower, with one saying that a cut in commercial banks' prime lending rate could come as early as Monday.

 The stock market advanced broadly Friday, as the Dow Jones average of 30 industrials climbed 25.42 points to 2,487.86, stretching its advance for a holiday-shortened week of four consecutive gains to 47.80 points. Bond prices climbed on more evidence the economy is slowing. The dollar finished lower against all major currencies except the Japanese yen after a steady selloff sparked by speculation that interest rates would decline. Silver futures prices fell sharply; gold futures settled lower; copper futures made strong gains; coffee futures sank; oil futures rose; grains and soybeans were lower; and livestock and meat mostly fell.

<HEAD>British Dock Strike Set for Tuesday</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s largest union on Friday called a dock strike starting Tuesday to compel employers to continue national negotiations on pay and conditions. After its dockworker members voted nearly 3-to-1 to strike, the 1.4 million-member <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> ordered out its 9,400 registered dockworkers and said the stoppage could last for months. The strike vote was 6,067 in favor and 2,111 against for an indefinite strike to protest the employers' refusal to allow national talks after the end of the National Dock Labor Scheme this week. `` Dockers must understand that if they walk out not all of them will be coming back. That's not a threat, it's economic reality,'' said <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Finney </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Port </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Employers </ORGANIZATION>. `` If any registered dock worker is sacked during the course of the dispute, there can be no return to work until he is reinstated,'' countered <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Todd </PERSON>, the union's general secretary. The employers, backed by the government, want a shift to local bargaining with the abolition July 3 of the dock labor plan at 60 ports that handle 70 percent of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s trade by volume and 50 percent by value. There are 102 ports handling the remainder, some employing fewer than 25 people. The dock labor plan guarantees registered dockworkers a paid job regardless of whether they have cargoes to handle. It was introduced during World War II to maintain a steady work force and was made permanent in 1947. The employers say the plan protected restrictive practices, forced the employment of 12 percent more workers than needed and was outdated by modern cargo handling, mainly gantry-swung containers replacing the docker's hook. Modern methods have cut the registered dock workforce from 65,000 in 1967 to 9,400. About 1,000 more workers are employed in the 102 non-plan ports, which handle the remainder of the country's trade. Large ports affected by the strike will include <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, Tees and <ORGANIZATION> Hartlepool </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Immingham </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Grimsby </LOCATION>, Forth, <ORGANIZATION> Southampton </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Liverpool </ORGANIZATION>. Most English Channel ferries should escape the strike because the ports of <LOCATION> Dover </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Felixstowe </LOCATION> are outside the plan. The major impact of the strike is expected on movement of cars, containerized manufactured goods, newsprint, timber, grain, perishable fruit, animal feed, iron ore and other minerals and chemicals. <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> oil operators plan to switch their supply vessels from <ORGANIZATION> Aberdeen </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Dundee </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION> to Norwegian ports. <PERSON> Finney </PERSON> said more than 1,000 dockworkers had quit before the strike, accepting up to 35,000 pounds, or about $ 56,700, in severance pay. `` Extensive plans have already been made by shippers and port customers to minimize the effect of a strike and safeguard the nation's trade,'' <PERSON> Finney </PERSON> said. The end of the dock labor plan means that dockworkers can be fired and non-union labor can be used on waterfronts; both actions formerly were illegal. The employers have been encouraging dockworkers to sign individual contracts.

 The <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> on Friday called a three-day holiday for its members east of the <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, saying the contractually allowed memorial period would restore calm in the coal fields. As many as 46,000 miners in 10 states have been involved in unauthorized strikes against coal operators who signed a no-strike contract with the union. They walked out over The <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>'s refusal to sign a <ORGANIZATION> UMW </ORGANIZATION> contract <ORGANIZATION> UMW </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Trumka </PERSON> called the memorial period. `` Although the union has requested that they return to work, the conditions which led to the protest _ excessive fines by federal and state courts, the arrest of thousands of union members and supporters by the <ORGANIZATION> Virginia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION>, the threat of indefinite jailings of union leaders and supporters and <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION>'s refusal to negotiate in good faith _ remain unchanged,'' <PERSON> Trumka </PERSON> said. It is the first official sanction of the wildcat strikes that have stricken the coal fields since June 12. The union had been under orders to lead the miners back to work. `` The union is calling this memorial period in an attempt to calm the volatile situation in the coal fields, in the hope that this period will help put an end to a situation where the actions of one renegade coal company and its allies have disrupted the entire coal industry,'' <PERSON> Trumka </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> <PERSON> Feibusch </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Bituminous </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Operators </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, which negotiated the national contract with the union, said he had no comment. The last two weeks of the wildcat walkouts have coincided with a national vacation period for most miners covered by the <ORGANIZATION> UMW </ORGANIZATION> contract, prompting speculation that its end would also mark the end of the unauthorized picketing. `` Right now, I see absolutely no movement to go back to work,'' said <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Green </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> UMW </ORGANIZATION> international executive board member from Charleston-based District 17. It was n't clear what <PERSON> Trumka </PERSON> plans at the end of the memorial holiday, which will begin Monday. But <ORGANIZATION> UMW </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Duray </PERSON> said union leaders would try to change the members' minds by the end of the break. `` These people were out to protest something and they want to see a change in the situation,'' <PERSON> Duray </PERSON> said. `` We will be out in the next three days to make sure they see a change in the situation.'' Union members will not have to picket other mines during the meorial period, <PERSON> Duray </PERSON> said. Keeping them off the streets should help restore order, he said. `` The purpose is to provide less of a sense of chaos out there,'' he said. `` We wo n't have pickets going around. Some locals will have meetings during the three days. Positive results will have a greater chance.'' Chaos reigned at a <LOCATION> Beckley </LOCATION> meeting hall Friday as about 2,000 striking coal miners protested the firing of 28 colleagues and prevented a hearing between union officials and the company that dismissed the miners. <PERSON> Toney </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Branch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> fired the men on Thursday, making them the first dismissed since the wildcat strikes began Dismissal forms circulated among the picketers said the men were fired for refusing to cross picket lines at the <LOCATION> Racine </LOCATION> mine. Company officals and represenatives from <ORGANIZATION> UMW </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> 17 refused to cross the pickets and enter the <LOCATION> Raleigh </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Armory </LOCATION>, where the sides were scheduled to meet to discuss the firings. The pickets dispersed after the meeting was postponed. `` This should tell them that all it's going to do is incite the workers,'' <PERSON> Green </PERSON> said from a telephone booth near the armory. Both sides agreed to waive time restrictions on the hearing and said they would meet at a later date. The firings apparently stand, however. About 37,000 workers in eight states were idled Friday as <ORGANIZATION> UMW </ORGANIZATION> members showed support for 1,900 coal miners striking The <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, which wants a separate contract with the union. <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> workers mined coal for more than 14 months without a contract before walking out April 5, refusing a company request that miners work mandatory overtime and on Sundays and refusing proposed cuts in medical benefits for pensioners. The <ORGANIZATION> BCOA </ORGANIZATION> said Friday that the wildcat strikes have kept $ 6 million from entering the trust fund set up to pay medical benefits to 118,000 pensioners who retired before 1976. <ORGANIZATION> BCOA </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON> also blamed $ 14 million in other losses since February 1988 on the union's granting some companies lower contribution rates and some coal companies' withholding contributions. `` What we need is for the <ORGANIZATION> UMWA </ORGANIZATION> miners ... to return to work, for the companies and the <ORGANIZATION> UMWA </ORGANIZATION> to honor existing contractural commitments and for the <ORGANIZATION> UMWA </ORGANIZATION> and the industry to work cooperatively to find additional sources of revenue for the funds,'' <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> has not paid into the fund since January 1988, <PERSON> Feibusch </PERSON> said, despite a continuing obligation to it because it has former employees covered by it.
