<TEXT>
 Federal prosecutors are investigating a controversial transaction through which Mayor-elect <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON> said he transferred stock to his son, the Daily News reported Sunday. The probe by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Maloney </PERSON>'s office is part of a larger inquiry into a cable television franchise related to <ORGANIZATION> Inner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, the News quoted unidentified law enforcement sources as saying. Investigators are trying to determine whether <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON> transferred <LOCATION> Inner </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> stock to his son, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, through a genuine transaction in 1985; how much it was worth and whether taxes were fully paid, the News said. <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON>' spokesman, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Fishlow </PERSON>, said the mayor-elect had hired a criminal attorney, <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Stillman </PERSON>. `` I'm confident this inquiry will reveal that there's nothing with which I need to be concerned,'' <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON> told reporters Sunday. `` Those of us in public life are subject to criticism and scrutiny of all sorts over time.'' <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON> said the federal investigation is a response to a suggestion by his opponent, Republican <PERSON> Rudolph </PERSON> <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON>, that the stock deal be looked into. `` My marching order from Mr. <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON> is 1,000 percent cooperation,'' <PERSON> Stillman </PERSON> told the News. `` We want to put this thing to bed once and for all.'' <PERSON> Stillman </PERSON>, however, also described the investigation as `` <PERSON> Rudy </PERSON> <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON>'s last hurrah.'' <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON>, a Democrat, defeated <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON> last month following a campaign highlighted by questions about <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON>' finances. <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON> is a former <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney for <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Maloney </PERSON> is <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney for <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION>. Inner City owns a number of radio stations and one of its subsidiaries has a substantial interest in the Queens Innerunity Cable Systems franchise. Its chairman, former <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> Borough President President <PERSON> Percy </PERSON> <PERSON> Sutton </PERSON>, is a longtime friend of <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON>. <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON> first acquired stock in the privately held company in 1972. His holdings grew to 588 shares, largely, he has said, through stock splits. <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON> said he transferred the stock to his son after his election as <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> borough president in 1985 to avoid a conflict between his position on the <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Estimate </ORGANIZATION> and the board's role in regulating cable television. It was assumed at the time that he gave the shares to his son as a gift. During the mayoral campaign, it was revealed that <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON> had not paid a gift tax. <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON> released a handwritten note dated Oct. 30, 1985, in which his son agreed to buy the stock, promising to pay $ 58,000 in 1991 plus 8 percent interest a year. <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON>, his son and <PERSON> Sutton </PERSON> then declined to release financial or corporate records that might further document the transaction as described. The News said the investigation includes testing the paper and the ink in the note to determine whether it was written in 1985 or during the campaign. There also are plans to analyze the handwriting. <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON> once placed the stock's worth at $ 1 million on a financial disclosure form. But during the campaign he said he had done so in error, based on an inflated appraisal by <PERSON> Sutton </PERSON>. The city Department of Investigation is conducting a separate, previously disclosed investigation into whether <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON> filed misleading financial disclosure forms regarding the stock.

 A charter fishing boat with 19 people aboard sank near the entrance to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION> Saturday, killing two men and injuring at least 16 other people, authorities said. All 19 people aboard were pulled from the frigid waters within two hours of the sinking, which was reported at about 3:30 p.m., <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> officials said. Captain <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Chale </PERSON> said the 110-foot <LOCATION> Bronx </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Queen </LOCATION> was in 40 feet of water `` when we hit something, hit a submerged object. Whatever it was, I have no idea. I never saw it. `` Soon as I seen I had trouble, I called the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> immediately,'' <PERSON> Chale </PERSON> said. The boat began taking on water right away. One of those rescued, an unidentified man in his 50s, died hours later at <LOCATION> Peninsula </LOCATION> <LOCATION> General </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> borough of <LOCATION> Queens </LOCATION>, said Sgt. <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Wrensen </PERSON>, a city police spokesowoman.

Fifteen other people were taken to two <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> hospitals, and a 16th was at Peninsula General in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Chale </PERSON> declined hospital treatment, said <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> Petty Officer <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Henderson </PERSON>. He was taken to the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> station at <LOCATION> Sandy </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hook </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, for questioning, <PERSON> Henderson </PERSON> said. The Bronx Queen went down near Ambrose Light, between <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> and about 15 miles southeast of the Verrazano Narrows Bridge spanning the entrance to the harbor, said Lt. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> operations center in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>. `` The seas were very rough when we got on the scene,'' said Petty Officer <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Pechacek </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Sandy </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hook </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, station. `` As we approached, we could see about 30 feet of the boat still above water and all the people were on the bow,'' <PERSON> Pechacek </PERSON> said.

 After four days of hiding out in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, Olympic gold medalist <PERSON> Nadia </PERSON> <PERSON> Comaneci </PERSON> spent her first full day of freedom in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> on Saturday doing the same thing. The 28-year-old Romanian gymnast, who burst into prominence with her run of perfect 10s in the 1976 Olympics, slipped out of sight Friday following a brief news conference shortly after her arrival at <ORGANIZATION> John </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> F. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kennedy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airport </ORGANIZATION>. `` I wanted to have a free life,'' said <PERSON> Comaneci </PERSON>, who was guaranteed political asylum here, and on Saturday that included staying out of the limelight generated by her defection. <PERSON> Comaneci </PERSON> reportedly spent Friday night in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, but there were varying reports about her whereabouts Saturday. <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> States </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gymnastics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Patti </PERSON> <PERSON> Auer </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> told a federation official that <PERSON> Comaneci </PERSON> was headed to <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> on Saturday afternoon on a <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> flight. But the captain of the flight <PERSON> Comaneci </PERSON> was scheduled to take said she had canceled her plans. `` <PERSON> Nadia </PERSON> was to be with us on our flight but ... she decided to stay in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>,'' said pilot <PERSON> Conrad </PERSON> <PERSON> Gosheff </PERSON>. `` At the last minute, they said she's not coming.'' <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Suzanne </PERSON> <PERSON> Timper </PERSON> said the airline _ which carried <PERSON> Comaneci </PERSON> into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> _ had no reservations out of JFK under the gymnast's name. Reporters at <LOCATION> JFK </LOCATION> when the Miami-bound flight was due to board did not see her and <LOCATION> Port </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Authority </LOCATION> police, who patrol the sprawling airport, said they were n't aware of her plans. <PERSON> Auer </PERSON> said <PERSON> Comaneci </PERSON> `` has not contacted us, and we'd like to know what her plans are.'' <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> press officer <PERSON> Sondra </PERSON> <PERSON> McCarty </PERSON> said her agency was not providing any information on <PERSON> Comaneci </PERSON>. In addition to the report that <PERSON> Comaneci </PERSON> was heading to <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, there were reports after her arrival here that she might go to <LOCATION> Indianapolis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Orlando </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Indianapolis </LOCATION> is where the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION> Gymnastics Federation is based, while <PERSON> Comaneci </PERSON>'s former Romanian coach, <PERSON> Bela </PERSON> <PERSON> Karoly </PERSON>, now is a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizen and runs an elite gymnastics training camp north of <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>. Another Romanian exile, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Boularca </PERSON> of <PERSON> Davie </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, said that <PERSON> Comaneci </PERSON> was coming to <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> to stay with <PERSON> Konstantin </PERSON> <PERSON> Panit </PERSON> and his family. Panit accompanied <PERSON> Comaneci </PERSON> at her news conference Friday; he lives with his wife and three children in a community of Romanians in south <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Comaneci </PERSON> was 14 years old when she gained worldwide fame by becoming the first gymnast ever to score a perfect 10 at the Olympics _ an achievement she repeated seven times at the 1976 games. She won 21 gold medals altogether in Olympic and other international meets during her career, earning a life of privilege in her hard-line Communist homeland. <PERSON> Comaneci </PERSON> _ accompanied by six fellow Romanians _ crossed the border into <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> on Tuesday and went into hiding. She told a border guard she was leaving <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> `` for the sake of freedom.'' <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>, unlike other Eastern European countries, has resisted the recent trend toward political and personal liberty for its residents. <PERSON> Comaneci </PERSON> would be eligible to apply for permanent resident status in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in one year, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials said. <PERSON> Karolyi </PERSON>, who was in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> last week, said Friday that he planned to return to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> this weekend and hoped to meet up with <PERSON> Comaneci </PERSON>, perhaps in <LOCATION> Indianapolis </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Jacki </PERSON>, the gymnastics federation's executive director, said late Saturday that he understood <PERSON> Comaneci </PERSON> would initially stay in a Romanian immigrant neighborhood in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>. `` I'm anticipating that she'll be there as long as she needs to be there,'' <PERSON> Jacki </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Indianapolis </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Jacki </PERSON> said <PERSON> Comaneci </PERSON> has been granted refugee status and now needs to select a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizen as a sponsor. `` Regardless of where she ends up, at least in the immediate future, we are hopeful to have dialogue with her and give her some advice and guidance,'' he said. `` I'd hate to have her make a decision that would be without that guidance. This is <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, and we want her to like it here and a have a positive and honest experience in everything she does.'' He said among her options would be working for the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> federation, `` or public relations, or be a candidate for the international federation. As a coach, she could touch many athletes.'' <PERSON> Jacki </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Terry </PERSON>, told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Indianapolis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Star </ORGANIZATION> that <PERSON> Comaneci </PERSON> is welcome to stay with her and her husband, adding, `` I think she kind of wants to stay here awhile.''

<HEAD>Report: Pierce Awarded HUD Grant To Friend Despite Protests</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Former federal housing secretary <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> awarded a $ 350,000 grant to a longtime friend although other housing officials had rejected the project, <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> reported. The 1985 grant was awarded to <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Singletary </PERSON>, a Republican who helped direct <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>'s unsuccessful campaigns for election as a <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> judge in 1959 and 1960, the Times reported in its Sunday editions. <PERSON> DuBois </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gilliam </PERSON>, a former <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> aide, told the Times that <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> ordered him to give the grant to <PERSON> Singletary </PERSON> even though others at the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> opposed it on the ground that <PERSON> Singletary </PERSON>'s firm had too little experience. `` I think it was a case where there was a longterm friendship between <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> and <PERSON> Singletary </PERSON>,'' said <PERSON> Gilliam </PERSON>, who is serving an 18-month prison sentence after pleading guilty to conspiracy charges involving other <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> grants. <PERSON> Gilliam </PERSON> said <PERSON> Singletary </PERSON> repeatedly called <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> about <PERSON> Singletary </PERSON>'s Washington-based consulting firm, the <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resource </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> `` told me he wanted us to help <PERSON> Singletary </PERSON> get some money _ he said <PERSON> Singletary </PERSON> is a good guy,'' <PERSON> Gilliam </PERSON> told the Times. <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> said through a lawyer, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Plotkin </PERSON>, that he did not remember the grant to <PERSON> Singletary </PERSON>. Even if he had ordered it, there would not have been anything improper about it, the lawyer said. `` This was a discretionary fund. This was his absolute right and authority,'' <PERSON> Plotkin </PERSON> told the Times. <PERSON> Singletary </PERSON> told the Times that he met with <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> several times but said he never discussed the grant. `` Are you asking me if <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> did me a favor? Absolutely not,'' <PERSON> Singletary </PERSON> said. The Times said <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> records indicate that <PERSON> Singletary </PERSON>'s group was supposed to use the grant to assist the cities of <LOCATION> Camden </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orange </LOCATION> in programs to attract private development money to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>. In recent months, <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>, citing his Fifth Amendment right against self incrimination, has refused to cooperate with congressional inquiries into political favoritism and fraud at <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> during the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> Administration.

<TEXT>
 The Philippine government asked for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> warplanes to attack rebel targets to help put down the latest military coup attempt against President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>'s government, two newspapers reported in their Sunday editions The `` urgent'' requests, which the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration refused late Thursday, were made by <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Fidel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramos </PERSON> through military and intelligence channels, <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> reported, citing a variety of unnamed administration sources. The Los Angeles Times, also citing an anonymous source, reported that the <LOCATION> Philippine </LOCATION> government asked that American planes bomb rebel-held air bases, fuel dumps and a seaborne freighter. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Manilla </LOCATION> received telephone calls from Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>, <PERSON> Ramos </PERSON> and another senior defense official, the Times said. The requests were numerous and confused, making it difficult for Gen. <PERSON> Colin </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Powell </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chiefs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Staff </ORGANIZATION>, to sort them out, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>. The request for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> planes to bomb some positions was turned down because Americans may have been on bases commandeered by the rebels and out of concern for the political impact of direct <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> intervention, the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> said. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> F-4 fighter-bombers flew cover for government troops on Friday and early Saturday morning but were idle on Sunday and never fired a shot at ground targets, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials said. According to earlier administration accounts, the jets were not deployed until Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> made a formal request through <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Platt </PERSON>. The Times said <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> `` wanted the fuel dumps and an armored column'' to come under <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attack. <PERSON> Ramos </PERSON> called for attacks on the air bases to disable rebel-controlled aircraft on the ground. The Philippine military official, who was not identified, wanted the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> to attack the freighter believed to be carrying munitions or reinforcements for the rebels.

<TEXT>
 A leader of the Philippine coup attempt said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military intervention was all that had kept President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>'s government from toppling and vowed to continue the insurrection, in an interview published Sunday. `` It ai n't over until it's over,'' Brig. Gen. <PERSON> Edgardo </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Abenina </PERSON> told the the <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>. `` We shall fight, and we shall continue fighting for what we believe in, for the honor of our nation and the dignity of our people _ even if it means going into a stage of civil war.'' Rebel soldiers battled loyalist troops in <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>'s financial district and at armed forces headquarters Sunday, the third day of an attempt to overthrow <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>. <PERSON> Abenina </PERSON>, a former officer of the Philippine constabulary, said the insurgents are mostly present or former members of the Philippine armed forces and none are politicians. He described them as reform-minded nationalists. <PERSON> Abenina </PERSON> said rebels were fighting <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> to `` free the Filipinos from the shackles of poverty and subservience that have been forced upon us by the rich and powerful, by elitist governments like that of <PERSON> Cory </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>.'' He added, `` Our whole point is that, for centuries, the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> have been under the mercy and control of a very few politicians and moneyed people.'' The coup, according to <PERSON> Abenina </PERSON>, has been planned for more than a year. <PERSON> Abenina </PERSON>, who <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> has identified as a rebel ring-leader, said, `` Our goal is to purge the armed forces and the political leadership of the government of the rampant corruption and patronage that has set in from the highest to the lowest levels.'' Lt. Col. <PERSON> Gregorio </PERSON> `` Gringo'' <PERSON> Honasan </PERSON> is part of the coup's leadership, <PERSON> Abenina </PERSON> said <PERSON> Honasan </PERSON> led an August 1987 coup attempt that left 53 dead. He was imprisoned but escaped in April 1988. <PERSON> Abenina </PERSON> also took part in the coup attempt and was jailed and later escaped. <PERSON> Abenina </PERSON> said if the coup succeeds he will establish a military-civilian governing council with himself in charge. The council would have five to seven members, exercise unchallenged executive power and include dozens of Filipino experts, technocrats and professors, <PERSON> Abenina </PERSON> said. He said the coup attempt, which began Friday, would have been successful if the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> mililtary had not intervened. When President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> announced that he was extending air support to the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> military, `` we were about to take over the government,'' <PERSON> Abenina </PERSON> said. `` Then the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> warplanes appeared. We simply can not hope to win against the stronger power of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> States </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>.'' According to <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> officials, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> F-4 fighter-bombers flew cover for loyalist troops on Friday and early Saturday morning but never fired a shot at ground targets.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said Sunday that he is prepared to take additional military action to defend the <LOCATION> Philippine </LOCATION> government against mutinous troops if American lives are threatened or President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> requests it. In a letter to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> congressional leaders under the War Powers Act, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> formally notified <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> that, at Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>'s request, he had ordered military support for the <LOCATION> Philippine </LOCATION> government to prevent rebel aircraft from taking off from two air bases briefly held by the rebels The <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> reported Sunday that the Philippine government had requested that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> warplanes attack rebel targets. The <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> said the request was turned down because Americans may have been on bases commandeered by the rebels and out of concern for the political impact of direct <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> intervention. At least 51 people have been killed and nearly 300 wounded since the insurgents launched their attempt Friday to overthrow the Aquino government. Rebel soldiers continued to battle loyalist troops in the capital's financial district and at armed forces headquarters Sunday. In his letter to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> wrote, `` At present, I do not foresee the need for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military action in addition to the measures described above. I am prepared, however, to take additional actions to protect the lives of <LOCATION> Americans </LOCATION>, should they be threatened, and, if requested, to provide further assistance to the government of the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said there were no American casualties during the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> action Friday. `` No rebel aircraft attempted to take off,'' he said, `` and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aircraft did not fire.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he also had ordered a company of Marines to reinforce the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> guard in <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he had acted `` in accordance with recognized principles of international law'' in backing the constitutional government of the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> and within his authority as president and commander-in-chief of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> armed forces.

 Government forces on Sunday repulsed an attack on military headquarters by rebel soliders seeking to topple President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>, and hundreds of insurgents surrendered. However, fighting continued between loyal troops and other rebels in the country's financial center. Military officials said the failure of the rebels to capture the Camp Aguinaldo military headquarters dealt a fatal blow to the 3-day-old coup attempt. `` I will fulfill what I said _ no cease-fire. What they started, we will finish,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> said in a national radio address. At least 51 people have been killed and nearly 300 wounded since the insurgents launched their revolt Friday. Rebels bombarded the military headquarters at <LOCATION> Camp </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aguinaldo </LOCATION> early Sunday with 105mm howitzers, and government jet fighters and helicopter gunships attacked the mutineers' positions. The military said the rebels also launched a ground attack on Camp Aquinaldo, five miles east of Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>'s office, but it was repulsed after a four-hour battle. The commander of the rebel assault, Lt. Col. <PERSON> Cesar </PERSON> <PERSON> dela </PERSON> <PERSON> Pena </PERSON>, later surrendered with more than 200 men. Later Sunday, Brig. Gen. <PERSON> Marcelo </PERSON> <PERSON> Blando </PERSON>, commander of <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Magsaysay </LOCATION>, surrendered in the city's <LOCATION> Greenhills </LOCATION> <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> with about 400 army soldiers and <ORGANIZATION> Scout </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rangers </ORGANIZATION>, military officials said. `` The attempted coup by rebel soldiers has been crushed,'' Defense Minister <PERSON> Fidel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramos </PERSON> said after <PERSON> dela </PERSON> <PERSON> Pena </PERSON> surrendered. Scattered sniper fire around the camp was reported later although there was no sign of substantial rebel forces in the area. In suburban <LOCATION> Makati </LOCATION>, the country's financial district, hundreds of heavily armed rebels were still holding out in luxury hotels, condominiums, banks and office buildings after battles broke out Saturday. Military sources said it would be difficult to remove the rebels because of the potential for damage and loss of civilian life. Police had planned to attack the mutineers late Saturday, but the rebels struck first, killing one policeman and wounding 14 others. Rebels fired volleys of machine-gun fire from <LOCATION> Makati </LOCATION> skyscrapers and snipers shot at vehicles on <PERSON> Epifanio </PERSON> delos Santos Avenue. Radio station <ORGANIZATION> DZRH </ORGANIZATION> broadcast an appeal for ambulances, saying many civilians lay wounded along <LOCATION> Makati </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Pasay </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Road </LOCATION>. A spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> U.S.-run </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Clark </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> said there were no American warplanes in the skies over <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> Sunday. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military planes began flying cover for government troops Friday, hours after rebels launched their assaults, but American officials said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> planes ended those flights at 6 a.m. Saturday. A government spokesman said Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> and her family attended Mass at the Malacanang Palace and prayed for an end to the carnage. The rebel shelling of Camp Aguinaldo set fire to the <ORGANIZATION> Headquarters </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Company </ORGANIZATION> building and hundreds of military families fled. Hospitals reported three people were killed and 25 wounded by the bombardment. Brig. Gen. <PERSON> Rodolfo </PERSON> <PERSON> Biazon </PERSON>, chief of the <ORGANIZATION> Capital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION>, said some mutinous marines infiltrated the camp, seizing the chapel, dispensary and other small buildings near the main gate. He said the rebels smashed through the main gate with an armored vehicle that was immediately hit by ground fire from the defenders and the mutineers were unable to advance. The country's two international airports in <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Cebu </LOCATION> remained closed Sunday, and domestic flights were also canceled. In <LOCATION> Makati </LOCATION>, rebels roamed through the affluent shops and Intercontinental Hotel Saturday. It was not known how many guests were registered at the hotel. The guests were allowed to stay inside, but mutineers ran other people out. Rebels blocked off a major street with commandeered trucks. One mutineer said his group changed the color of its shoulder patches from white to red `` because red is the color of blood, and we want to shed blood for our cause.'' Military Chief of Staff Gen. <PERSON> Renato </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Villa </PERSON> said rebels controlled parts of <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Mactan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Air </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Base </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Cebu </LOCATION>, 350 miles south of <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>. The army commander, Maj. Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Cacanando </PERSON>, estimated that from 800 to 2,000 troopers had joined the revolt, the sixth attempted coup against Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> in less than four years and the most serious challenge to her government. Police said some assailants may be Communist insurgents seeking to take advantage of confusion brought on by the revolt, which began Friday when mutineers seized air force headquarters at <LOCATION> Villamor </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Air </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Base </LOCATION>, the government television station and other strongpoints. The rebels later gave up the air base and station. Warplanes had attacked rebel positions around Camp Aguinaldo Saturday and the insurgents fired back with tanks, mortars and machine guns. In one attack, air force jets accidentally strafed 2,000 pro-government troopers, killing six. Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>'s failure to crush the 20-year-old Communist insurgency is one reason for the discontent with her government, particularly within the military. She also has been criticized for not improving the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>' economy since coming to power in a 1986 military-civilian uprising that ousted President <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>. Military officials said one coup leader _ an associate of renegade Lt. Col. <PERSON> Gregorio </PERSON> `` Gringo'' <PERSON> Honasan </PERSON>, who led an August 1987 coup try _ had been arrested. Rebel sources said <PERSON> Honasan </PERSON> was among the key planners of the current coup attempt. Maj. <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Gutierrez </PERSON> identified the rebel leader as Lt. Col. <PERSON> Tito </PERSON> <PERSON> Legazpi </PERSON> and said he was arrested after taking part in an attack on the <LOCATION> Sangley </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Point </LOCATION> naval air station outside <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>, which the rebels briefly held.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> ended two days of storm-tossed summitry Sunday and said they were satisfied they had made progress toward a better East-West relationship in a time of tumultuous change in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. But neither man pointed to a specific agreement on a key range of arms control or other issues, and at an unprecedented joint news conference, cited specific disagreements over weapons shipments to leftist rebels in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> and proposed naval arms reductions. The two men seemed at ease as they fielded questions aboard the Soviet luxury liner Maxim Gorky, shaking hands and leaving the news conference together at its conclusion. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said he was `` encouraged and inspired'' by the changes in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, where hardline regimes have been swept away in recent weeks. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said the Soviet leader had `` laid to rest'' the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> doctrine under which the Kremlin had invaded <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> in 1956 and <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> in 1968. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said that in his two days of talks with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, there were `` elements of optimism and pessimism here and I would n't dwell into the details.'' `` It was a no agenda meeting, it accomplished everything I hoped it would,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said there was no specific timetable for a new arms agreement to cut long range nuclear forces by 50 percent, but he hoped one could be agreed on before a summit set for next June in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The two men directed Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> and Soviet Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> to meet again soon on arms control issues. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> also said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had made a new proposal to reduce chemical weapons that was positive, and that top-ranking officials on both sides would be meeting to continue negotiating a treaty. Both <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> stressed the importance of their personal relationship, despite their repeated references to the differences they found over the two days. `` We stated, both of us, that the world leaves the one epoch of cold war and enters another epoch,'' he said. `` This is just the beginning. We are just at the very beginning of our long road to a longlasting peaceful period.'' Near the end of their news conference, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> suggested thanking reporters for their cooperation, but he added, `` although of course we do n't know what they've written yet or what they will be writing.'' Said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>: `` Reserve the right to thank them afterwards you mean? after we've seen what they've written?'' Replied <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>: `` No, right now, and they will write better.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said the two men had begun to develop a future that `` can realize a lasting peace and transform the East-West relationship.'' But when asked about <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s desire for naval arms reductions, he said he was `` disinclined to think that is an area where we will make immediate progress.'' Asked about <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, where the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has complained about continued flow of Soviet arms to <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> rebels, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said `` we had an in-depth discussion on these questions as President <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> has said.'' He added, `` I ca n't say there are no differences between us, but we had a chance to talk about them.'' The two men fielded questions after ending nearly eight hours of talks over two days that focused on arms control, trade, regional conflicts in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and elsewhere as well as <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was flying to <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION> after the summit to brief <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> leaders on the summit talks. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> was going to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> to hold a similar meeting with <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact leaders _ many of them newly installed as a result of Eastern European changes. Howling winds and heavy seas have plagued the summit throughout, curtailing Saturday's sessions and forcing the leaders to meet aboard a Soviet luxury liner rather than <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet warships. But the rains that flooded this Mediterranean island abated Sunday, and skies were gray but clearing. `` Long time, no see,'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> told <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> at the opening of Sunday's meeting. `` Back again,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, smiling. `` You did a little sea travel,'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said. Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> was wearing a medicinal patch behind his ear to ward off seasickness, but White House press secretary <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was feeling `` terrific'' and enjoying the rough weather. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>,'' he added, `` does n't share our love of the sea.'' As he was departing the USS Belknap, the president was asked if the weather had made the summit a failure. `` Hell no. Hell no,'' he replied. `` This summit's going just fine, thank you.'' Said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>: `` We do n't care where we're meeting. The big thing is we're getting something done, and it's good. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> attended a worship service aboard the USS Belknap before leaving for the Soviet cruise ship. During a storm-shortened opening summit session Saturday, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> invited <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in the last two weeks of June 1990, setting a target date for a meeting that was agreed on last September. They worked to fix target dates for signing treaties that would slash strategic nuclear arms, conventional forces in central <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and chemical weapons on both sides. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> suggested signing a treaty providing a 30 percent to 50 percent cut in long-range nuclear arms by the June summit, and signing an accord on reducing <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet ground forces in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> at a NATO-Warsaw Pact meeting in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> late next year. On Saturday, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> took note of the dramatic changes under way in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, where the <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> Wall has crumbled and several hardline Communist regimes have been swept aside recently, by urging <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> to join him in recommending that <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> be the site of the 2004 Olympic Games. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also expressed willingness to help the Soviet economy as a means of bolstering the <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s domestic reforms. A White House official, who spoke only on condition he not be identified, said that if the Soviets pass a liberal emigration law that is being pushed by <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will grant <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> a range of trade favors. The assistance could include steps to grant the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> most-favored-nation trading status, lower tariffs on Soviet imports into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and observer status for the Soviets at the 97-nation General Agreement on Trade on Tariffs.

 Communist leader <PERSON> Egon </PERSON> <PERSON> Krenz </PERSON> and his ruling party Politburo resigned Sunday along with the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, hounded from office by increasing demands from <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s emboldened pro-democracy movement Former hard-line party leader <PERSON> Erich </PERSON> <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON> was expelled from the party he had led for 18 years until he was ousted and replaced by <ORGANIZATION> Krenz </ORGANIZATION> on Oct. 18. Three recently fired Politburo members were arrested on corruption charges, and a senior trade official fled <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. Politburo member <PERSON> Guenter </PERSON> <PERSON> Schabowski </PERSON>, who was generally considered a reformer, announced the resignations of the 10-man Politburo and the 163-member <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> on state radio. They came as the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s policy-making <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> met in an emergency session following demands from the burgeoning pro-democracy movement that <ORGANIZATION> Krenz </ORGANIZATION>, 52, resign. He was jeered by party members Saturday. The resignations were the latest development in a historic series of political changes that have transformed <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> from a hard-line <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> nation to one that is at the forefront of <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s reform movement. Under pressure from mass demonstrations and the exodus of thousands, <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> has thrown open its borders and the <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> Wall, and lawmakers eliminated the Communists' constitutionally guaranteed leading role in society. In a deperate attempt to retain power and put a lid on the pro-democracy movement, <ORGANIZATION> Krenz </ORGANIZATION> had promised the people that he would investigate disclosures of corruption and high living among top party officials. The Communist Party on Sunday expelled a large number of its former leadership, including <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON>, former Premier <PERSON> Willi </PERSON> <PERSON> Stoph </PERSON> and former <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> speaker <PERSON> Horst </PERSON> <PERSON> Sindermann </PERSON>, the state-run news agency <ORGANIZATION> ADN </ORGANIZATION> said. The move came after growing calls for the resignations of <ORGANIZATION> Krenz </ORGANIZATION> and the entire leadership amid charges of massive corruption in the top party ranks. One of those arrested was the senior economic adviser to <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON>. <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Schalck-Golodkowski </PERSON>, a state secretary in the foreign trade ministry, fled <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> after authorities opened an investigation against him for suspected illegal weapons sales, <ORGANIZATION> ADN </ORGANIZATION> said Sunday. <PERSON> Schalck-Golodkowski </PERSON> was <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s chief trade negotiator and had headed a department responsible for making hard-currency sales. Government spokesman <PERSON> Wolfgang </PERSON> <PERSON> Meyer </PERSON> said <PERSON> Schalck-Golodkowski </PERSON> was stripped of his functions following his escape. <ORGANIZATION> ADN </ORGANIZATION> said he went to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> on Saturday for trade talks and returned to <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> later the same day. <PERSON> Wolfgang </PERSON> <PERSON> Vogel </PERSON>, the country's most prominent lawyer, told authorities early Sunday that <PERSON> Schalck-Golodkowski </PERSON> was `` at an unknown location outside <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'' and that he had asked <PERSON> Vogel </PERSON> to represent him, according to ADN. The investigation was opened after officials Saturday discovered a secret operation to ship weapons to the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> ADN </ORGANIZATION> said. Hard-currency earnings from the sales went to the country's foreign trade bank addressed to <ORGANIZATION> Schalck-Golodkowski </ORGANIZATION>, it said. On Saturday, 3,000 <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> members jeered <ORGANIZATION> Krenz </ORGANIZATION> and whistled when he promised the party would investigate disclosures of corruption and high living among top party officials. `` Too late!'' they shouted. Ousted Politburo members <PERSON> Guenter </PERSON> <PERSON> Mittag </PERSON> and <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Tisch </PERSON> were taken into investigative custody suspected of `` heavily damaging socialist property and the people's economy through abuse of power,'' <ORGANIZATION> ADN </ORGANIZATION> said Sunday. Also arrested was <PERSON> Gerhard </PERSON> <PERSON> Mueller </PERSON>, a former party leader in the city of <LOCATION> Erfurt </LOCATION> and former candidate member of the Politburo. Prosecutors issued the arrest warrants Saturday, and they were apprehended later, the news agency said. It did not specify which day. <PERSON> Mittag </PERSON> had been the senior economic adviser to <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON>. The Communist Party has blamed the two for <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s economic crisis and has begun a disciplinary investigation of them. <PERSON> Mittag </PERSON> was ousted from the party last month. <PERSON> Tisch </PERSON> had been the chief of the Communist-run trade unions federation until the organization expelled him on Nov. 27. He also was removed from the ruling Politburo last month for allegedly abusing his powers. Two other former high-ranking Communist officials were arrested on Saturday. <PERSON> Hans </PERSON> <PERSON> Albrecht </PERSON>, the former party chief in the <LOCATION> Suhl </LOCATION> region, and <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON>, director of a large home construction company in <LOCATION> Suhl </LOCATION>, were arrested under suspicion of `` fraudulently damaging socialist property,'' <ORGANIZATION> ADN </ORGANIZATION> said without elaboaration. On Friday, lawmakers heard complaints at a parliamentary session that top officials had taken bribes, indulged themselves with luxuries at state expense and stashed away more than $ 54 billion in foreign bank accounts. Since taking over from <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON> on Oct. 18, <ORGANIZATION> Krenz </ORGANIZATION> has begun a program of sweeping reforms that includes promises of free elections and abolition of the Communists' 40-year monopoly of power. <PERSON> Krenz </PERSON> was jeered in a speech Saturday night outside the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> building. It was his latest attempt to distance himself from the old hard-line leadership, of which he was a prominent member. He has denied living opulently, as other leaders did under <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON>. The lavish lifestyles of top party officials have been a major source of discontent in a country where the average citizen has to wait 10 years or more for a car.

 Embattled Communist leaders on Sunday named five non-Communists to a new coalition government, but an angered opposition called the appointments an `` outrage'' and vowed to resume demonstrations. The Communists held on to 16 of the 21 Cabinet seats, including the premiership and the powerful defense ministry, the state-run media said. Thirteen members were holdovers from the previous Communist Cabinet. The appointments were made by Communist Premier <PERSON> Ladislav </PERSON> <PERSON> Adamec </PERSON> and President <PERSON> Gustav </PERSON> <PERSON> Husak </PERSON>, a hard-liner who took control of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> after <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pact </ORGANIZATION> tanks crushed the democratic `` Prague Spring'' reforms in 1968. It is the first time non-Communists have held top government positions since 1968. <PERSON> Jiri </PERSON> <PERSON> Dienstbier </PERSON>, a spokesman for Civic Forum, the nation's largest opposition group, rejected the new government, saying: `` It is more complicated than that. He said Civic Forum would call another mass rally Monday at <LOCATION> Wenceslas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION>, the focal point of two weeks of pro-democracy protests that ended the Communists' 41-year monopoly on power. One Civic Forum leader, speaking on condition of anonymity, called the new government an `` outrage,'' and said the Monday rally would get Czechoslovakians back on the street. Striking students whose protest of police brutality at a Nov. 17 demonstration spurred the nation's peaceful revolt, laughed derisively as they listened to a radio announcement of the new Cabinet. `` It is a disappointment,'' said a strike leader, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Cech </PERSON>. `` We will now have to decide what to do.'' <PERSON> Adamec </PERSON>, who opened negotiations with the opposition 12 days ago, retained his post, the state-run news agency <ORGANIZATION> CTK </ORGANIZATION> reported. Among the new Communist appointees was <PERSON> Miroslav </PERSON> <PERSON> Vacek </PERSON>, who took over the post of defense minister. <PERSON> Vacek </PERSON>, an army general, was named despite an opposition demand that the ministry be headed by a civilian. <PERSON> Vacek </PERSON> had served as deputy minister under former <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Minister <PERSON> Milan </PERSON> <PERSON> Vaclavik </PERSON>, also an army general. The new interior minister, <PERSON> Frantisek </PERSON> <PERSON> Pinc </PERSON>, is a civilian, as the opposition had demanded, but he is a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. Civic Forum had demanded a non-Communist. Asked why Civic Forum's demands had not been fully met, Deputy Premier <PERSON> Bohumil </PERSON> <PERSON> Urban </PERSON> told reporters, `` This is what life is like. You ca n't take into account everybody's demands immediately.'' But in a move obviously calculated to appease demands for more religious freedom, <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> Hromadka </PERSON>, a high-ranking leader of <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> church, was named one of seven deputy premiers. Of the five non-Communists named to the government, three had no official party affiliation. The new Cabinet appointees were for the most part political unknowns. <PERSON> Adamec </PERSON> agreed Tuesday in talks with Civic Forum to appoint a new government that would include non-Communists. He said last week that many of the old <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> members had wanted to implement reforms, but were unable to because of the hard-line policies of the ruling Politburo. <PERSON> Dienstbier </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> on Saturday that the opposition did not propose specific candidates for the new Cabinet, but concentrated on outlining what characteristics office holders should have. Communists, members of previously docile allied parties and non-party people are acceptable to Civic Forum if they have no obvious blemish in their past and are willing to implement reforms now that will lead to free elections and genuine democracy, <PERSON> Dienstbier </PERSON> said. Civic Forum, established only two weeks ago, is an umbrella movement of opposition groups. Its leaders say they are not putting themselves forward for Cabinet posts, but have left open the possibility of accepting nominations.

 American furriers are feeling the heat _ and it's not from their mink coats Increased pressure from animal rights advocates picketing fur stores, holding annual `` Fur-Free Fridays'' and chanting slogans like `` Buy a fur and slip into something dead'' have taken a toll. Now the fur industry is fighting back. Fur manufacturers, some facing financial losses, recently hired one of the world's largest public relations agencies to represent them and have paid for dramatic newspaper ads claiming activists will soon tell people not to eat meat. `` If those people really want to be socially conscious, they should n't wear gold jewelry or diamonds from <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> or leather shoes,'' said <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Lennad </PERSON>, owner of <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Lennad </PERSON> <PERSON> Furs </PERSON>, one of the largest fur stores in the <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> area. Last month, the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> firm of <ORGANIZATION> Burson-Marsteller </ORGANIZATION> sent out kits to fur retailers that included guidelines for handling the media and dealing with anti-fur demonstrations. The kit also included a hotline number for furriers faced with questions about the fur trade and provided form letters for use in writing letters to the editor. The fur industry also took out ads twice last month in <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> Sunday editions that read, in part, `` Today fur. Tomorrow leather, then wool. Then meat.'' Fur farmers have also joined the effort. <PERSON> Marsha </PERSON> <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON>, associate executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> Fur </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farm </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Animal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Welfare </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paul </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minn. </LOCATION>, said the coalition is `` redoubling efforts to re-educate the public about the industry.'' Fur farmers are being briefed on issues, educational materials about the fur industry are being sent to schools, and a communications network has been established linking fur farmers around the country, <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> said. The public relations effort faces an uphill battle. Magazine and billboard advertisements paid for by animal rights groups have become increasingly more common _ and graphic. A full-page ad in this month's Spy magazine contains photographs of a trapper approaching a fox whose leg is caught in a trap, then standing on the animal and suffocating him. Ads at bus stops in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> depict a leghold trap with a raccoon's foot caught in it. Another print ad shows a simple leghold trap accompanied by the words `` Get a Feel for Fur. Slam Your Fingers in a Car Door.'' Other anti-fur tactics are on the rise as well. The fourth annual `` Fur-Free Friday'' last month drew 2,500 animal rights activists in a march in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. Protesters also targeted a dozen other cities. More than 140 celebrities, including <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> and <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> McCartney </PERSON>, <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Basinger </PERSON>, <PERSON> Carol </PERSON> <PERSON> Burnett </PERSON>, <PERSON> Art </PERSON> <PERSON> Linkletter </PERSON> and <PERSON> Christie </PERSON> <PERSON> Brinkley </PERSON>, have signed anti-fur statements circulated by the animal rights group Beauty Without Cruelty. Animal rights activists claim fur farming is inhumane and caters to vanity. The furriers maintain that the protesters are infringing on freedom of choice. They also claim that the fur industry is strictly regulated and that animals receive excellent care. `` A rat is a pig is a dog is a boy,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Meltzer </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Evans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, the nation's largest retailer of fur, repeating a phrase used often by furriers and their representatives. `` This is just the beginning for them. This is all about freedom of choice. They're trying to take away First Amendment rights.'' Despite the hiring of <ORGANIZATION> Burson-Marsteller </ORGANIZATION> last summer and the newspaper ads last month, the fur industry denies animal rights protesters have had an impact on business. Most say the public relations effort is an attempt to forestall any future harm. Though the fur industry tripled sales from 1979 to 1986, jumping from $ 850 million yearly to $ 1.8 billion, the boom has since leveled out. The Fur Vault, the country's second-largest American fur chain, reported losses of over $ 7 million in the last two years. Its retail operation is for sale. The two other publicly held fur companies in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> also reported recent considerable quarterly earnings losses. But industry spokesmen insist business is basically good and blame any losses on recent warm winters and a soft economy _ not protesters. `` There's been no impact on business,'' said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Parsons </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> Fur </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>. `` The impetus -LRB- for the newspaper ads -RRB- was a feeling among the furriers that the public was ready to hear from the fur industry. Our customers were asking, what's the story?''

<TEXT>
 A powerful state senator goes on trial Monday amid strong indications that the federal corruption investigation that led to his indictment could result in charges against two other lawmakers. State Sen. <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Montoya </PERSON>, who chairs the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Professions </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, has pleaded innocent to 12 felony counts that accuse him of racketeering, extortion, bribery and money laundering. Among the alleged victims of his shakedown efforts: actor <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Asner </PERSON>. If convicted, <PERSON> Montoya </PERSON> faces a maximum of 220 years in prison and more than $ 3 million in fines. The Democrat from the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> suburb of <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Monte </LOCATION>, who's been in the Legislature for 17 years, is the first person to be tried as a result of an investigation that began in 1985. The investigation included agents who posed as <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> businessmen seeking a bill to aid a shrimp-importing company they hoped to establish, and a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> aide who cooperated with the agents by wearing a hidden recording device. The bill was eventually passed, but Gov. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Deukmejian </PERSON>, who had been tipped off by the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>, vetoed it. The probe became public in dramatic fashion in August 1988, when 30 federal agents raided the Capitol offices of <PERSON> Montoya </PERSON>, three other lawmakers and their aides. There were reports that during the raid, aides in some offices shredded documents and erased sensitive computer information. Besides <PERSON> Montoya </PERSON>, one of his former aides, an Assembly aide, a former <LOCATION> Yolo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> sheriff and a former undersheriff have also been charged. And while prosecutors are saying little about the investigation, a plea bargain reached last week could mean at least two other lawmakers will face charges. <PERSON> Karin </PERSON> <PERSON> Watson </PERSON>, a key aide to Assembly Republicans, pleaded guilty Tuesday to one extortion count and agreed to help prosecutors. That development could spell trouble for the two <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> members whose offices were searched 15 months ago, <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Nolan </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Glendale </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Hill </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Whittier </LOCATION>. According to papers filed in the case, <PERSON> Watson </PERSON> played a key role in setting up two meetings in June 1988 at which $ 12,500 was paid to an undercover agent. News articles have linked <PERSON> Nolan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hill </PERSON> to those meetings. Both have denied wrongdoing. <PERSON> Montoya </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Sands </PERSON>, refused to discuss the case last week. But <PERSON> Sands </PERSON> said in an earlier interview that he was `` convinced that <PERSON> Montoya </PERSON>'s position can be sustained.'' According to <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> aides, defense attorneys have subpoenaed about half the 40 members of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> to testify at the trial, apparently in an attempt to show that <PERSON> Montoya </PERSON>'s actions were not out of the ordinary. Among other things, <PERSON> Montoya </PERSON> is accused of accepting a $ 3,000 `` honorarium'' from an undercover agent in exchange for help in getting the bill to help the fictional shrimp business through the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. The charge alleging an extortion attempt against <PERSON> Asner </PERSON> stems from a 1985 meeting, at the time the popular actor, known for his roles in `` The <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Tyler </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> Show,'' `` <PERSON> Lou </PERSON> <PERSON> Grant </PERSON>'' and `` Roots,'' was president of the <ORGANIZATION> Screen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Actors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guild </ORGANIZATION>. According to a memorandum filed by prosecutors last month, <PERSON> Asner </PERSON> and a lobbyist for the guild went to see <PERSON> Montoya </PERSON> in May 1985 to seek his vote against a bill their union opposed. `` <PERSON> Montoya </PERSON> took the two into his office and closed the door,'' the memorandum said. `` He then stated in no uncertain terms that he did not see why he should support the guild since the guild had not made financial contributions to him.'' The memo said <PERSON> Asner </PERSON> and the lobbyist were `` infuriated and disgusted'' and the meeting ended abruptly. <PERSON> Montoya </PERSON> voted against the guild's side that afternoon, the memo added. In another incident, prosecutors alleged, <PERSON> Montoya </PERSON> wrote letters to all <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> high school principals, urging them not to insure their athletes with a particular insurance company. The letters were written after the company's owner refused to pay <PERSON> Montoya </PERSON> $ 10,000 for support of legislation backed by the company, the memorandum said. A key figure in the investigation, the memorandum said, was <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Shahabian </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> staffer who tried to extort an undercover agent and then agreed to cooperate with the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> in exchange for lenient treatment. In June 1988, <PERSON> Shahabian </PERSON> asked an unidentified legislator what it would take to get the shrimp legislation out of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, the memorandum said. `` Well, you need to make some arrangements with <PERSON> Joe </PERSON>,'' the lawmaker reportedly told <PERSON> Shahabian </PERSON>. `` What it'll take with <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> is a little envelope.'' Later that month, Shahabian, wearing a hidden recording device, went to see <PERSON> Montoya </PERSON>. <PERSON> Montoya </PERSON> asked if the organizers of shrimp deal were `` doing well,'' and learning that they were, replied, `` OK, so they can be helpful.'' Later in the conversation, after <PERSON> Montoya </PERSON> was assured that the bill would attract little attention, <PERSON> Shahabian </PERSON> asked, `` How can we be helpful to you?'' `` Either way, -LRB- campaign -RRB- contributions and @ or honorariums,'' <PERSON> Montoya </PERSON> reportedly said. A luncheon meeting was set up with the undercover agent, at which time the $ 3,000 check was passed to <PERSON> Montoya </PERSON>, the memo said.

<HEAD>Rare Toxic Algae Bloom in Lake Near Tacoma, Wash.</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A rare algae toxin in a suburban lake killed two cats, said health officials who want people to stay away from the deadly water. The soupy, blue-green masses of algae in <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> are so toxic that a few glassfuls of contaminated water could kill a human being, said <ORGANIZATION> Tacoma-Pierce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials. So far, officials have found the toxin only in a northern cove of the lake. Its presence was confirmed Friday. Signs and leaflets were being distributed, and further tests in the lake and others were planned Monday, said <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Coble </PERSON>, head of the agency's water resource section. The toxic algae normally live two weeks to a month, but health officials plan to kill it with copper sulphate Monday. The chemical itself is toxic, but it must be used in this case because of the danger of the algae, <PERSON> Coble </PERSON> said. `` It's pretty rough environmentally, but we're worried that the wind might shift and it -LRB- the algae -RRB- could spread,'' she said. The toxin affects the nervous system, and most mammals killed by it die of respiratory failure. There have been no recorded toxin-related human deaths in the state. Health officials confirmed the toxin was in the lake after testing at <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lutheran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> showed that mice injected with it died within minutes. Emergency rooms and veterinarians were alerted to watch for signs of the algae toxin in patients. `` It suddenly turned into an emergency,'' <PERSON> Coble </PERSON> said. The tests followed an autopsy on two cats taken to the health department a week ago. Green matter was found in their stomachs and on their fur, indicating they probably ingested the toxin by cleaning their coats. W.T. <PERSON> Edmondson </PERSON>, a retired <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> professor who specializes in lake ecology, said no one knows exactly what triggers the usually harmless algae to produce the toxin, but sewage appears to play a key role. The toxin is common in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> and has killed cattle and other large mammals, he said.

<HEAD>Small Businesses Bailing Out of Pension Plans Because of Complex
Laws</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRYNA BRENNAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Hundreds of small businesses across the country are ditching their employee pension plans, saying federal rules make the benefit programs too costly and complex to maintain. Employers claim congressional tinkering with a 1974 pension law has dramatically increased the paperwork, accountants and administrative personnel needed to comply with the law. `` It's impossible,'' said <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Turner </PERSON>, a third generation lumber company owner in <LOCATION> Clarksburg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> W. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION> `` We're going to drop the plan. <PERSON> Alvin </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lurie </PERSON>, a former assistant commissioner for the <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, says <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> is typical of small business owners who tried but failed to keep current with the ever-changing provisions of the 1974 Employee Retirement Income Security Act. `` It has become much, much too complicated,'' said <PERSON> Lurie </PERSON>, now chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Special </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> on Pension Simplification. `` It's frightful. People ca n't afford it, do n't understand it.'' A <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, attorney who handles the pension plans for several hundred small businesses said he is advising his clients to drop them. A <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, plan administrator said about 30 percent of the small businesses she works with are terminating their programs. But some say the business owners are simply using regulations as an excuse. `` I do n't think it's that clear cut that the -LRB- congressional -RRB- revisions have led small businesses to drop their plans,'' a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> aide said, asking that she not be further identified. `` I'm skeptical because they can go into simplified plans.'' Many of the employers bailing out of the federally insured pension plans are setting up profit-sharing or other programs seen as less beneficial to employees because they usually require the workers to put up some of the money. The pension law, known as ERISA, was enacted by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to protect the 76 million <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> workers with pension plans and their $ 2 trillion in pension assets. Always complex, the law saw a series of amendments over the years that proved, in some cases, expensive or frustrating for employers. The <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s inspector general's office, cautioning that the pension system is open to fraud and embezzlement, wants <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to enact additional laws to prevent possible abuses. `` I think the people writing the laws are trying to be fair and equitable, but they do n't understand what the costs mean,'' said <PERSON> Paula </PERSON> <PERSON> Calamafde </PERSON>, a tax lawyer and head of the <ORGANIZATION> Small </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Turner </PERSON>, who plans to give his employees the cash due to them from the pension fund, said he always tried to keep up with the laws. The required paperwork grew from 35 pages to 77 pages this year, he said. Then the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> came in to check out his plan and disqualified it on a technicality. His report lacked this phrase: `` These are the rules we will follow if the plan becomes top heavy,'' a measure designed to prevent employers from favoring top management. `` We felt like the Gestapo had been turned loose on us,'' he said. `` It's not fair. I have always told the Internal Revenue I'll do what ever I have to do to stay qualified. The Social Security Administration says the number of full-time workers with employer-financed pension plans fell to 46 percent last year, down from 50 percent in 1979. Only 29 percent of the workers in companies employing between 25 and 49 workers have such plans, while 67 percent of those in companies of 250 workers or more are covered. The federal insurer of private pension plans, the <ORGANIZATION> Pension </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Benefit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guarantee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corporation </ORGANIZATION>, received 10,790 notices of planned termination in fiscal 1988. But the organization, already $ 1.5 billion in the red, does not separate large from small businesses. Business owners are required to notify the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> PBGC </ORGANIZATION> and all plan participants before they end pension plans. <PERSON> Chet </PERSON> <PERSON> Salkind </PERSON>, executive director of the New York-based <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pension </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Actuaries </ORGANIZATION>, said there has been a constant decline in employer-financed plans and an increase in programs in which employees contribute, such as the 401 -LRB- k -RRB- savings plans. `` From the employee angle there's a tremendous difference,'' <PERSON> Salkind </PERSON> explained. `` Usually it's employee money and not a guaranteed amount.'' <PERSON> Donna </PERSON> <PERSON> Hopson </PERSON>, a plan administrator and president of the <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ana </LOCATION>, Calif.-based <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pension </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administrators </ORGANIZATION>, said her office used to see about four plan terminations a year but that this year there have been about 60 terminations among her 250 clients. Employers who end the plans pay their workers the amount accrued, but Ms. <PERSON> Hopson </PERSON> said bailing out undermines the nation's retirement program `` The feedback I get is they take the money and spend it,'' she said. Ms. <PERSON> Hopson </PERSON> puts the blame on laws that add to the cost of compliance, requiring detailed reports, accountants, actuaries and plan administrators. `` We ca n't spend the amount of time necessary to keep the plan updated and comply with the provisions,'' said a <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> employer who spoke on condition of anonymity because she is still in the process of terminating her plan. `` It took two months of my time.'' A <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> restaurant owner, who asked not to be further identified because `` I do n't trust the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION>,'' said he dropped his employer-paid plan and set up a profit-sharing program. `` With a profit-sharing plan I can put into it whatever I want,'' he said, adding that the government required him to put $ 113,000 into his employer-paid pension plan last year.

 Q. Did you assure President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> that the changes in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> are irreversible, that the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has foresaken the right to intervene there militarily? And President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, similarly, as a result of this meeting, are you now more trusting that the Soviets have, indeed, renounced the <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON> <PERSON> Doctrine </PERSON>? Q. A most important question from <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> for Mr. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. Will Soviets renounce the Brezhnev Doctrine which enabled the Soviets to invade <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> in 1968? GORBACHEV: I do n't want to be understood as being authorized to speak on behalf of all Eastern European countries. This would not be in keeping with the facts. We are part of <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> certainly; we are part of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> as a whole, too. And we work together with our allies in all areas. We have profound ties, but each country is an independent power, an independent factor in world politics. And each people has the right to decide, and does decide the fate of its own state. All I can say is my view. And I think that these changes in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and the Eastern European countries, as an objective fact, have been caused by the actual historic process itself, and no one can avoid that. It's a problem whose time has come. We have to solve it by new means, using our experience and the potential which these states have accumulated, and also opening up opportunities for the use of everything that's been a positive accumulated in human experience. And I think the orientation of these processes is something that we should welcome because it's connected with the desire of these peoples to ennoble their societies, to make them more democratic, humanitarian, to open up to the rest of the world So I'm encouraged and inspired by all these processes, and I'm sure this is the way they are understood and appreciated by other peoples. Of course, I also see that there are processes going on, profound processes of change in <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> countries, too, including Western European countries. And this is very important, too. There's a kind of a movement bringing states, countries, and continents together. But nevertheless, there are processes where each individual country prefers its commitments, its choices, and its individualities. That's very important, and it's important for all of us to understand that. Q. I'm speaking on behalf of a group of Czechoslovak ... BUSH: And as President <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> talks about democratic change, and peaceful, that certainly lays to rest previous doctrines that may have had a different approach. And so we are _ he knows, and not just the president, but all the people in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would like to see this peaceful, democratic evolution continue. And so I think that's the best way to answer the question, because the change is so dramatic and so obvious to people. But I will say we had a very good chance to discuss it in considerably more detail than I think would be appropriate to discuss it here. Q. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, you have accused the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> for sending arms to <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, to <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, and President <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, you have denied those charges. Now both of you are sitting here together, who is right? BUSH: Maybe I ought to take the first shot at that one. I do n't think we accused the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> of that What we did say is arms were going in there in an unsatisfactory way. My view is that not only did the Nicaraguans acquiesce in it, but they encouraged in it _ encouraged that to happen. And the evidence is demonstrable. But I'm not challenging whether _ the word of the foreign minister. He and <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> talked about that, and President <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and I talked about it. All I know is that _ and he said it earlier, elections _ free elections is _ should be the mode. And I also reported to him what Mr. <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> called me about, blaming <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> and the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> for exporting revolution and for just tearing things up there in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. So we may have a difference on that one, but I want to be careful when you say I accused them of sending these weapons. I did not, because Mr. <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> made a direct representation to Mr. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>. And everyone knows that there's a wide international arms flow out there, but whatever it is, however it comes, it is unsatisfactory for countries in the region that want to see the evolution toward democracy continue. GORBACHEV: The president has quite rightly reported our discussion on this. There was no accusation made against us and we did n't have to accept or reject such an accusation, therefore. We told the president that we have assurances _ firm assurances from <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> that no deliveries using certain aircraft actually were carried out. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> did n't agree with that and we heard that also. Nevertheless, from the point of view of the principle, I said, and President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> confirmed this, that we're in favor of free elections. We want to see this conflict ended by political means, and we want to see a normalization of the situation there. PRESIDENT <PERSON> BUSH </PERSON>: That's what we agreed on. I agreed _ I agree that that's where the _ Q What about the accusations of <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> on <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>? BUSH: _ that that's the assessment. I still feel that arms are going into <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>. We've seen clear evidence of it, and _ but I ca n't argue with the factual presentation made here. But we have a difference. I do n't believe that the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> have told the truth to our Soviet friends. And why? Because we know for a fact certain that arms have gone in there. I'm not saying they're Soviet arms. They've said they are n't shipping arms and I'm accepting that. But they're going in there and I am saying that they have misled Mr. <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> when they gave a specific representation that no arms were going from <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> into <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>. And that's _ so we have some differences in how we look at this key question And the best way to have those differences ameliorated is to have these certifiably free elections in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. And <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> _ I have no influence with him whatsoever. And maybe somebody is yelling that question at President <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. But look, we've got some differences in different places around the world. Q. President <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, what about the accusations of President <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> on _ about <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>? <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> apparently called President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and told him that <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> really created the situation in the region.

<TEXT>
 GORBACHEV: We discussed the situation in <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, expressed our views on the basis of our own analysis and our own assessment, said to the president that the conditions are ripe for changing the situation for the better. The different sides do have a wish to do this, to normalize the situation, not only in the region but also in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Q. How do you assess the German situation? GORBACHEV: Do you want to begin on the German question? BUSH: I'd be glad ... Somebody better tell me what the question was then, if I'm going to answer. Was it the question of <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>? The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, part of <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>, has had a longstanding position. <LOCATION> Helsinki </LOCATION> spells out permanent borders. We _ I made clear to President <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> that we, for our part, do not want to do anything that is unrealistic, and causes any country to end up going backwards, or end up having its own people in military conflict, one with the other. And so, I think we have tried to act with the word that President <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> has used to _ and that is, `` with caution,'' not to go demonstrating on top of the <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> Wall to show how happy we are about the change. We are happy about the change. And the German question is _ I've heard many leaders speak about the German question, and I do n't think it is the role of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to _ to dictate the rapidity of change in any country. It's a matter for the people to determine themselves. So that's our position, and the last word goes to the chairman on this one. GORBACHEV: Yes, on that as he ended, the president wrote in English and I do n't read English. I answered him in Russian and he does n't read Russian. But, we agreed. -LRB- Laughter. -RRB- BUSH: No matter what it said. ... GORBACHEV: I have several times expressed my views on this point, and because we discussed it with the president, we considered all these questions on the condition of the <LOCATION> Helsinki </LOCATION> process. We realize that the real situation in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, the current situation in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> is that in modern <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> there are two German states, <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Germany </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> German </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Democratic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>. Well, there are two German states in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> today, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> and the <LOCATION> German </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Democratic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>. They are members of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>, sovereign states. This is the bidding of history, this is what history has willed. I always have recourse to this argument. So as to remain realistic, we must understand that history does dictate the fate and the processes on the continent, and also determines the role and place of these two states. And we think that there is an understanding today in the minds of all. And any artificial attempt to do anything to that process _ well, we must n't do anything to belittle the great significance of the great changes which are happening in this continent. It's a central part of contemporary history. It would not be _ we do n't want to do anything to accelerate these changes artificially for the peoples of these two great German states Can we thank the press for its cooperation? Of course, we do n't know what they've written yet, and what they will be writing -LRB- Laughter. -RRB- BUSH: Reserve the right to thank them afterward, you mean? After they've written? GORBACHEV: No. I think right now, and they will write better. I'd like to thank you for your cooperation. BUSH: We do have to leave at 1:20 _ should we each take one more question or not? Agreeable? All right, last one _ last one for me right here. No rebuttal, no back up question. The last one. Q. What's your personal relationship now between the two _ -LRB- inaudible -RRB- _ and would regular contacts that would perhaps no longer be called summits be helpful? BUSH: I had known President <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> before and I'll let him speak for himself, but I think we have a good personal relationship and I believe that helps each side be frank, point out the differences as well as the areas we agree on. And that is a very, very important ingredient, I think, because of the standing of the two powers and because of the dramatic change that is taking place. And I am not saying that if he likes me, he is going to change longheld policies, and I'm going to say if I like him, we're not going to change longheld policies. But what we've been able to do here is to get together and talk about the differences without rancor and as frankly as possible. And I think it's been very constructive. So I could n't have asked for a better result out of this non-summit summit. -LRB- Laughter. -RRB- And the question is regular meetings? I'm open for _ to see him as much as it requires to keep things moving forward. We've already set a summit meeting. That summit meeting will drive the arms control agenda. And that's a good thing, because I represented to him that we wanted to see a START agreement, a <ORGANIZATION> CFE </ORGANIZATION> agreement, and hopefully a chemical agreement. That's a very ambitious agenda. But I think if we had n't sat here and talked we might not have understood how each other feels on these important questions. GORBACHEV: I'd like to confirm what's just been said by President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, that we've known each other for quite a long time now. I'd just like to add that perhaps _ of course we did n't agree on this with the president, and I do n't think I'm disclosing a great secret, that we've already had detailed discussions when we had our previous contacts, and we informed each other of each other's positions basically. At Governor's <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> or in the automobiles, we've had discussions, and we've had correspondence subsequently. And this meeting we've had here has made our personal contacts, placed them on a different level, and I'm very happy with the meeting we've had, the talks we've had, two talks one-on-one Like the president, I do feel that personal contact is a very important factor in relations between political leaders, particularly of such states as the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. And I am committed to the idea of personal contacts. Although, as I said to the _ as the president said correctly, this does n't mean that for the sake of personal contacts, we can back away from our positions or can forget our responsibilities. No, it's's just that personal contacts makes it possible for us the better to carry out our responsibilities and work together more effectively and more effective cooperation in the interest of our two peoples and in interests of the whole world community On my own behalf I'd like to thank you for this meeting. Thank you, Mr. <PERSON> President </PERSON>, for your cooperation for Soviet-American endeavors. BUSH: Thank you, sir. Well, I guess we're going to fly away to <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>It May Not Be Mayberry, But Siler City Is Home To Actress Who Played
Aunt Bee</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SILER CITY, N.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 It's got the usual fast-food restaurants, video-rental stores, three banks and a department store. But there's something else that makes this town of 5,000 more than just a spot on the map. It's the home of Aunt Bee, the devoted, loveable matron who looked after Sheriff <PERSON> Andy </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> and his son, <PERSON> Opie </PERSON>, on `` The <PERSON> Andy </PERSON> <PERSON> Griffith </PERSON> Show.'' Born 86 years ago in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, actress <PERSON> Frances </PERSON> <PERSON> Bavier </PERSON> chose to retire to this town after a career that included Broadway as well as television. The town is in the same region as the fictional <PERSON> Mayberry </PERSON>, <LOCATION> N.C </LOCATION>. Though she's avoided interviews and contacts with visiting fans over the years, and has been ailing lately, she's made friends among the folks here. And everyone calls her `` Aunt Bee.'' `` Every year at some time or another, people get it in their head to check up on Aunt Bee,'' says <PERSON> Velma </PERSON> <PERSON> Sadler </PERSON>, the Police Department records clerk and a 12-year friend of Ms. <PERSON> Bavier </PERSON>. `` It's just a shame this year's influx coincides with <PERSON> Aunt </PERSON> <PERSON> Bee </PERSON> being in the hospital. Ms. <PERSON> Bavier </PERSON> was admitted to the coronary care unit of <LOCATION> Chatham </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> here the day before Thanksgiving. Hospital officials say they're not releasing any details at her request and that does n't surprise most residents `` She's an extremely private individual, and she's let that be known,'' said <PERSON> Wanda </PERSON> <PERSON> Ingold </PERSON>, town clerk. Sometimes, admiring or curious outsiders have made life difficult. `` We'll get people in here all the time asking what her address is or for directions to her house,'' said police detective Sgt. <PERSON> Alphonzo </PERSON> <PERSON> Craven </PERSON>. `` We get television crews and reporters down here all the time trying to get some information,'' <PERSON> Craven </PERSON> said. `` They ask questions like ` Is there an <PERSON> Andy </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> sheriff here? Is there a deputy like <PERSON> Barney </PERSON> <PERSON> Fife </PERSON>?' It's ridiculous. All Aunt Bee wants is to be left alone. That's why she came here _ to retire in peace.'' Before her role as <PERSON> Beatrice </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> in the long-running 1960s series starring <PERSON> Griffith </PERSON> as a Southern sheriff, Ms. <PERSON> Bavier </PERSON> appeared in such Broadway productions as `` Kiss and Tell,'' `` Point of No Return,'' and `` The Lady Says No.'' When she retired in the early 1970s, she moved from <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Siler </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, one of a number of towns that had invited her to appear at celebrations over the years. Like Mount Airy, the town on which <PERSON> Griffith </PERSON> loosely based <PERSON> Mayberry </PERSON>, it is in the hilly <LOCATION> Piedmont </LOCATION> region between the coast and the Appalachians. `` I guess when she came down here to do parades and other events, she just liked the people,'' Ms. <PERSON> Sadler </PERSON> said. `` It really is a nice area and the people are extremely nice.'' `` Sure, there might have been a fuss when she first moved here,'' said town tax collector <PERSON> Dottie </PERSON> <PERSON> Mendenhall </PERSON>. `` Now she's just another resident to the people who live here.'' Ms. <PERSON> Sadler </PERSON> describes Ms. <PERSON> Bavier </PERSON> as `` extremely nice to me ... nothing but a good friend. We talk about museums, operas, plays we've both seen. Why she moved here or her days on the show really never came up. `` She's an elderly, ailing, sick woman.'' <LOCATION> Siler </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> has a different aura from the fictional <PERSON> Mayberry </PERSON>, but it's still a family-oriented community. Women walking into the <LOCATION> Glendale </LOCATION> hosiery mill's outlet store are greeted by name. `` That's just the way things are around here,'' Ms. <PERSON> Sadler </PERSON> said. `` I think that's why Aunt Bee probably moved here. We have our problems like anyplace, but it really is a nice place to live.''

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> moved closer together at their <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> summit to curb the nuclear and conventional arms races and drop the curtain on the Cold War. But they also discovered that the pace of events, especially in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, is rapidly outstripping the capacity of the two most powerful leaders in the world to shape the future. Even as <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> were winding up their two-day near-summit on Sunday the entire Politburo and <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> party <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> resigned in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. Orthodox communism is on the run, crumbling faster than anyone had predicted. And while <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was jetting here Thursday night from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> a friendly but troubled government in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> teetered on the edge of a military coup. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s preparations for the summit had to compete with evaluating the threat to President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> and the extent of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military intervention deemed necessary to protect her. Even Mother Nature gave the two superpower leaders a stomach-tossing display of how unpredictable the universe can be. Stormy seas forced them to rearrange their schedule and cancel both a Saturday afternoon meeting and a dinner that night. Despite it all, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> found common ground on the direction they would like the world to take, and that the road ahead is a long one. And while there were no arms-control breakthroughs or specific timetables set for treaty-signings, the two mutually pledged to work to that end. `` We stated, both of us, that the world leaves the one epoch of Cold War and enters another epoch,'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said. `` This is just the beginning. We are just at the very beginning of our long road to a long-lasting peaceful period.'' The tentative nature of their joint venture is reflected in the absence of any concrete agreements, and the evident failure of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to halt the delivery of Soviet arms to rebels in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>. The pipeline, which the administration claims runs through <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, was denounced by Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> on the eve of the summit, as `` a relic of the Cold War.'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials said <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, in discussing the explosive issue with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, professed not to know how the anti-aircraft launchers and other arms got to the leftist <ORGANIZATION> FMLN </ORGANIZATION> forces. Perhaps mindful of fast-paced events in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and in all other <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact countries except <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>, the Soviet leader also spoke modestly of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet powers to manage history. `` In our position,'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said, `` the most dangerous thing is to exaggerate. We always should preserve elements of cautiousness. I have used the favorite word of President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>.'' The reference to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s political style draw laughter from reporters assembled aboard the Soviet cruise ship <PERSON> Maxim </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorky </PERSON>. But <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was serious about the leaders' limitations as well as the expectations for a meeting he refused to call a summit. `` It is not for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> to design the future for Europeans,'' he said, `` or for any other people. I am convinced that a cooperative U.S.-Soviet relationship can indeed make the future safer and brighter.'' In that vein, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> determined to speed the completion of three arms control accords _ to banish chemical weapons, reduce long-range nuclear missiles by 30 to 50 percent, and to reduce troops, tanks, artillery and other conventional forces in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. On the other hand, the summit produced no specific accords to attain those goals. Nor did the leaders establish a schedule for completing the three treaties, although they both said they hoped to place their signatures on a nuclear arms cut when they meet next summer in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. It is one thing to urge negotiators on, and another to make the sort of command decisions that breaks deadlocks. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> underscored how much remains to be done. For instance, he would like a ceiling placed on warships as part of the disarmament process. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> disagrees. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> will be reduced, but only by domestic budget constraints and not at the negotiating table. And no deal was struck to limit nuclear-tipped cruise missiles carried aboard submarines and surface ships. That is the touchiest issue in the strategic weapons field. On the conventional arms front, meanwhile, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> registered the <ORGANIZATION> Kremlin </ORGANIZATION>'s complaint with <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> attempts to trim thousands of Soviet airplanes that the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> claims have a defense mission. Repeatedly, however, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> stressed the common ground he found with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. He also made <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> support for perestroika, the restructuring of the Soviet economy, concrete with an offer of trading privileges. `` It was a no agenda meeting, it accomplished everything I hoped it would,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> newspaper said Sunday that the Western arms policy, including <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> refusal to reduce its naval forces, still is based on confrontation and threatens efforts to ease tensions with <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. `` There is little optimism in the fact that military budgets and programs in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and other <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> countries still regard military force as the major means of achieving designated foreign policy goals,'' <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Star </ORGANIZATION> said in a commentary written by <PERSON> Vasily </PERSON> <PERSON> Pustov </PERSON>. The newspaper printed the commentary as Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> completed talks in <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION> and expressed optimism at plans for arms reductions. However, the leaders also cited their disagreement over proposed naval arms reductions. <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Star </ORGANIZATION> said both East and West must change their outlook to improve international relations. `` In the current stage of transition in international development, it is all the more obvious that the path to a stable world and mutual security lies through serious changes not only in the East, but in the West,'' the newspaper said in a commentary. It praised signs of change in some <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treat </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> countries, specifically consideration of military cuts in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. But, it added, `` some actions by <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> and its leading members appear to be a glaring anachronism against the background of improving international climate.'' <PERSON> Pustov </PERSON> said the unwillingness of <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to include its superior naval forces in negotiations with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> were alarming. `` This puts in doubt, and even threatens much of what has been achieved in the area of limiting weapons as a result of long and difficult negotiations.'' Top Soviet military officials previously have expressed concern about <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> naval superiority even as the two sides try to work out an agreement to reduce their coventional forces in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. Marshal <PERSON> Sergei </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Akhromeyev </PERSON>, the former military chief of staff and a <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> adviser, said in the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> daily Pravda in October that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has 2 -LCB- times more large-surface ships, 15 attack aircraft carriers to none for the Soviets, 2 -LCB- times more maritime aircraft and 19 times more marines. `` The <LOCATION> U.S.A. </LOCATION>, most likely, intends to continue using these forces to put pressure on us and threaten the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>,'' he said. <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Star </ORGANIZATION> cited <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> doctrine that regards nuclear deterrence as a condition for constructive talks with the <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pact </ORGANIZATION>, and the Western view that the presence of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> conventional and nuclear forces is `` vitally important for European security.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> flew to <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>, after the summit Sunday to discuss the talks with <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> allies. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> flew to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, where he will meet with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pact </ORGANIZATION> allies this week.

<HEAD>Report Cites Serious Lapse in Security at Nuclear Weapons Lab</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BURNS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A secret inspection of a federal nuclear weapons laboratory in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> found serious security lapses last spring, including poor protection of large amounts of plutonium, according to a congressional report released Sunday. The report also said the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> from 1982 through 1988 misled the president, in its annual reports to the White House, about the adequacy of measures to protect weapons-grade nuclear materials from potential theft or sabotage. The report included a declassified transcript of a closed hearing last July in which several senior <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials testified on security and safeguards weaknesses in the nuclear weapons production and design complex. The hearing was held by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee on oversight and investigations. Portions of the hearing transcript and department documents were deleted by the department. The subcommittee is continuing to investigate the department's nuclear weapons facilities, which in recent months have been wracked by allegations of health, safety and environmental violations Some key plants have been closed temporarily. In the hearing transcript, portions of a previously secret report by <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> McCallum </PERSON>, director of the department's weapons security evaluations office, were published. These included a passage highly critical of nuclear materials protection at <ORGANIZATION> Lawrence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Livermore </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratory </ORGANIZATION>, near <LOCATION> Livermore </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif </LOCATION>. The Livermore lab has come under fire in recent years for illegal drug use by some employees, alleged ethics and conflict-of-interest violations by senior lab officials and charges of theft of government property from the facility. The lab is run for the government by the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION>. One passage from the McCallum report said security systems at a <LOCATION> Livermore </LOCATION> building in which weapons-grade plutonium is handled `` do not provide assurance'' that the highly radioactive material is `` adequately protected from theft or sabotage.'' Also, it said the security system was unreliable in detecting contraband at entry gates and intruders at specially protected areas with access to nuclear materials. Under questioning from Rep. <PERSON> Gerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Sikorski </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Minn </LOCATION>., <PERSON> McCallum </PERSON> said these security lapses involved `` category one'' quantities of plutonium, or amounts greater than 4 -LCB- pounds, which is enough to build a nuclear bomb <PERSON> McCallum </PERSON>'s report was based on an inspection last April and May of <PERSON> Livermore </PERSON> and the department's regional office in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> which oversees the lab's operations. Another published portion of <PERSON> McCallum </PERSON>'s report said the lab sometimes allowed `` category one'' quantities of plutonium to be left unattended in rooms without security alarms. <PERSON> McCallum </PERSON> told <PERSON> Sikorski </PERSON> this was a serious breach of security. Among other disclosures in the subcommittee report: _ Among all the 26 weapons facilities and regional offices inspected for security and weapons materials protection safeguards by <PERSON> McCallum </PERSON>'s office over the past year, <PERSON> Livermore </PERSON> ranked the lowest _ The <LOCATION> Oak </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ridge </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nev. </LOCATION>, regional offices used private contractors in some cases to screen and interview weapons plant employees seeking security clearances These contractors did not actually grant any clearances, but their role nonetheless was contrary to department policy, officials said. _ The department acknowledged that it lacks the resources to complete investigations of suspected security violations by some weapons employees who currently have access to classified material This violates the department's own policy, <PERSON> McCallum </PERSON> wrote in his report, `` and does not provide assurance that only eligible individuals are granted continued access to security interests.'' The hearing also disclosed that the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> regional office had chosen not to include the plutonium-handling building in its own most recent inspections of <LOCATION> Livermore </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pearman </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, acting manager of the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> office, told the panel that because of this omission, he was not aware of the plutonium safeguards problems at the time of the McCallum inspection. In a later written response to <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Dingell </PERSON>, D-Mich., Energy Secretary <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> called the omission `` a serious oversight. <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> also said the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> office had changed its inspection methods to include `` an intensive annual survey'' of all lab facilities. In the subcommittee report released Sunday, <PERSON> Dingell </PERSON> said annual reports to the president from the energy secretary had offered `` a misleading account'' of the level of protection being afforded special nuclear materials and nuclear facilities. `` The most recent reports to the president are more on the order of what one would expect from your local <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Dingell </PERSON> said. He added later the subcommittee was told that a senior weapons security official at <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> headquarters, <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Badolato </PERSON>, told those preparing an annual report to the president that it should be `` general in nature and contain pictures.''

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> remained at odds Sunday over the issue of arms shipments to Marxist rebels in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>. But they agreed democratic elections are the best hope for long-term stability in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. And <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said the weekend summit helped narrow U.S.-Soviet differences over conflicts in the region. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, at a joint news conference with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> after their two-day shipboard summit, said he restated <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> concerns that <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> are shipping Soviet-made arms to leftist guerrillas in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> reiterated that the Soviets are not involved. And, he said he had been assured by the Sandinista government in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> that it was not shipping arms to the Salvadoran rebels. `` We have a difference,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` I do n't believe that the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> have told the truth to our Soviet friends. And why? Because we know for a fact certain that arms have gone in there.'' As evidence of a continuation of such shipments, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has cited surface-to-air weapons and other arms recently found in the wreckage of a plane that crashed in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration says the weapons were destined for Salvadoran guerrillas fighting the U.S.-backed government. Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, appearing on <ORGANIZATION> CBS-TV </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Face the Nation,'' said, `` It's not a case of our thinking that the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> is sending weapons to <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, because they've told us they're not, and we believe them But, he added, `` We do believe the Soviets when they say they're trying to convince their clients -LRB- <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> -RRB- not to do this, to go for a political solution in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> We think they're trying ... We would like to encourage them to try a little harder ...'' In their joint appearance, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> agreed that a free and fair election in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> is the key to resolving tensions in the region. `` We're in favor of free elections,'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said. `` We want to see this conflict ended by political means, and we want to see a normalization of the situation there.'' `` That's what we agreed on,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> interjected. The Nicaraguan government has pledged free elections next year, but the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration is skeptical about whether the Sandinista government led by President <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortego </PERSON> will really allow a free and fair vote that could knock it out of power. Later, speaking to a small group of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> reporters, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said that Soviet `` assistance to <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> and their lip service for the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> give us a considerable amount of difference with them.'' He added that `` until we see a free <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>, self-determination and the people deciding what they want, <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> will stick out ... as a small country swimming against <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s own tide.''

<HEAD>800 Protesters Arrested Outside Union Carbide Plant</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Police arrested about 800 people Sunday when they tried to hold a protest inside the vacant Union Carbide plant on the five-year anniversary of a gas leak that killed more than 3,500 people. Before marching toward the plant, the protesters burned two 10-foot effigies symbolizing the U.S-based multinational company to mark the anniversary of the world's worst industrial accident. `` Down with Union Carbide!'' the crowd shouted as hundreds of riot police stood behind steel barricades erected in front of the main gate of the pesticide plant, which was closed after the gas leak on Dec. 3, 1984. V.C. <PERSON> David </PERSON>, a senior police officer, said about 600 men and 200 women were arrested and taken in buses to a city sports stadium that was turned into a temporary jail. <PERSON> David </PERSON> said the people would not be held long. Such detentions are legal under Indian law and are commonly used to break up protests. <PERSON> David </PERSON> said some protesters hurled stones at the buses before they got in. `` We just wanted to show our protest and anger against the government and the company,'' said <PERSON> Balkrishna </PERSON> <PERSON> Gupta </PERSON>, the city secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> India </ORGANIZATION>, which organized the rally. He said all the demonstrators lived in shantytowns around the plant and were directly in the path of the deadly methyl isocynate gas that leaked from it. At least 3,598 people have died from effects of the gas. Effigies made of bamboo, straw and rags were set on fire by a 60-year-old woman, <PERSON> Birju </PERSON> <PERSON> Bai </PERSON>, whose husband and four children were killed by the gas. On Saturday night, several groups of victims burned effigies of <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carbide </ORGANIZATION> and its former chairman, <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, in about a dozen neighborhoods. Others prayed in churches, mosques and temples for the victims. <PERSON> Gupta </PERSON> demanded the government distribute the $ 470 milion that <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carbide </ORGANIZATION> gave to the Indian government in April in final compensation for the accident. But the government's right to agree to the Supreme Court-supervised settlement has been challenged in the same court, delaying disbursement of most of the money. The Indian government has spent millions of rupees on relief and rehabilitation, but survivors say the measures are inadequate. The government had originally sued <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carbide </ORGANIZATION> for $ 3 billion, alleging negligence. Union Carbide said the leak was the result of sabotage by a disgruntled employee. Relief workers say gas victims continue to die at a rate of at least one a day. About 20,000 survivors still suffer from exposure to the gas. Most victims suffer from eye and lung ailments and are unable to work. On Sunday morning, the government organized prayer services for the victims. The <LOCATION> Madhya </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pradesh </LOCATION> state chief minister <PERSON> Motil </PERSON> <PERSON> Lal </PERSON> <PERSON> Vohra </PERSON> said in a message: `` The gas victims are still struggling for life, sustaining their endurance, fortitude, indomitable courage and firm determination.''

 The murder of a powerful banker killed by a bomb on his way to work has unleashed accusations that police overlooked clear signs terrorists were about to strike. Police have identified one of the probable suspects, a fugitive member of the notorious <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Faction </ORGANIZATION> leftist terrorist gang, but have made no arrests. Thursday's killing of <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Herrhausen </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Deutsche </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>, stunned <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, which for weeks has been preoccupied with events in neighboring <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. Authorities say <PERSON> Herrhausen </PERSON>'s murder resembles at least four previous <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Faction </ORGANIZATION> attacks. But there are increasing allegations that security officials failed to notice indications that <PERSON> Herrhausen </PERSON> was targeted. One newspaper on Saturday asked how terrorists could set up a sophisticated bomb-trigger mechanism on <PERSON> Herrhausen </PERSON>'s route without being noticed by a special unit assigned to watch out for suspicious activities. Discovery more than a month ago of a wire that apparently was intended for use with the bomb also posed some uncomfortable questions about security precautions. Besides the two security cars that normally escorted <PERSON> Herrhausen </PERSON>'s Mercedes, a special Hesse state police unit had been recently assigned daily to observe his route to work in <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Cologne </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rundschau </ORGANIZATION> newspaper said. `` Police officials overlooked clear signs of the attack,'' the newspaper charged. <PERSON> Willi </PERSON> <PERSON> Fundermann </PERSON>, spokesman for the federal police, told the newspaper that officials were examining whether `` there were lapses in the observation deployment.'' <PERSON> Herrhausen </PERSON>, 59, was killed near his home in <LOCATION> Bad </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Homburg </LOCATION> as his car passed by a light-beam device, triggering the powerful bomb that destroyed his Mercedes. The bomb was strapped to a bicycle on the side of the road. Authorities say they believe preparations for the attack began at least four weeks earlier. These preparations included included chiseling out a long gap in a sidewalk, laying wires in the crack, covering them up with asphalt and recoloring the spot to make it appear it had not been touched, they said. Federal officials said that late last month, a person noticed a wire had been placed across the sidewalk. `` Without knowing its significance, the wire was removed'' by the person, chief Federal Prosecutor <PERSON> Kurt </PERSON> <PERSON> Rebmann </PERSON> said on Friday. Police have found the bombers' getaway car. They also discovered that the car's forged license plates bear identical characteristics to plates recovered from cars used by leftist terrorists in at least four previous attacks. <PERSON> Erwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Huber </PERSON>, of the arch-conservative <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, sister party of Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION>, charged there has been `` neglect in the search for terrorists.'' The Bonn-based newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Die </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Welt </ORGANIZATION> reported that police in other states were not immediately made aware of essentials of the attack, speculating that could have hindered any attempts to catch the bombers. Authorities have tentatively identified one of the two suspected bombers as <PERSON> Christoph </PERSON> <PERSON> Seidler </PERSON>, 31, one of the country's most-wanted leftist terrorists. He has been involved with the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Faction </ORGANIZATION> for at least a decade, they said. The <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Faction </ORGANIZATION> has a long history of attacks on West German business and political figures as well as <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military targets. The group had been relatively inactive in the past three years.

 Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said Sunday he agreed with President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> that the superpowers should do `` our very best'' to help bring peace to <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. `` There's a real chance of taking a decisive step to open a process of a settlement,'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> told a news conference after two days of talks with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. `` And what it's important to do is not to miss the opportunity to do that, because the situation changes very swiftly.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said: `` We have found that the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> is playing a constructive role in the <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> and trying throughout the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>'' to support a settlement.

 After all was said and done, the summit at sea was conducted beside a pier. Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> never put to sea and President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had trouble reaching shore. `` I do n't think anyone can say that the saltwater get-together was anything other than adventure, at least out in the harbor here,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said at the close of the summit. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> conducted all their business on the Soviet liner Maxim Gorky docked at <LOCATION> Marsaxlokk </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> instead of the gale-buffeted Soviet missile cruiser Slava and USS Belknap, two warships anchored not far from harbor. `` I want to thank the captain and crew of <PERSON> Belknap </PERSON> for the great support that they've given us _ I think they were wondering if I was about to become a permanent guest,'' said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who was stranded aboard the ship Saturday night by the storm. Switching sites for the shipboard summit raised questions about whether it was a good idea in the first place. `` No, it was a very good idea,'' insisted <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, when a reporter asked the question as the president arrived onboard the luxury liner. But, one reporter asked, did n't he think it was just as well that the Soviets happened to have a big cruise boat handy at the dock? `` We could have floated the Holiday Inn out here,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> replied, referring to the hotel prepared by White House staff as a back-up meeting venue. `` This shows we can adjust to changing circumstances very well,'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> interjected. White House spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said Sunday's meetings could have taken place onboard the USS <PERSON> Belknap </PERSON> as planned, but <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> did n't want to come out to the ship, about 500 yards offshore. `` He does n't share our love for the sea,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said.

Pool reporters aboard the Maxim Gorky reported that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, a former naval officer, wore a medicated patch used to prevent motion sickness after spending what crewmen aboard the <PERSON> Belknap </PERSON> described as a rough night. <PERSON> Belknap </PERSON> crewmen said the ship was swinging on its forward anchor throughout the second straight night of the fierce December gale. But <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> apparently suffered no ill effects from the motion. `` He was fine. But I think some of his Secret Service guys were a little green,'' said one officer. Both <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, who told reporters no one was seasick, were seen Sunday morning using scopalamine, a penny-size patch worn behind the ear that releases medication to stabilize the liquid in the labyrinth of the inner ear, which controls balance. The patch, which lasts 72 hours, is a used as a precaution against seasickness and not as a treatment. White House strategist <PERSON> Sig </PERSON> <PERSON> Rogich </PERSON> told reporters earlier that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> enjoys rough weather. But other travelers from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> indicated they had a hard time of it. `` We're not used to this in <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>, a native of that midwestern state.

 _ At the close of the summit, the leaders of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> held an unprecedented joint news conference in an atmosphere so free of superpower tension that it would have seemed impossible to believe just a few years ago <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> got the biggest laugh with a small, well-aimed barb at <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s much-publicized intention to approach the summit carefully. `` In our position the most dangerous thing is to exaggerate. We always should preserve elements of cautiousness,'' said <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, pausing before he added, `` I have used the favorite word of President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>.'' At another point, while the two leaders were discussing their positions on the possible reunification of <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said that he and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had exchanged messages on the question. `` The president wrote in English and I do n't read English. I answered him in Russian and he does n't read Russian. But, we agreed,'' said <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. `` No matter what it said,'' added <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. Near the end of their news conference, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> suggested thanking reporters for their cooperation, but he added, `` although of course we do n't know what they've written yet or what they will be writing.'' But <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, again showing caution, asked: `` Reserve the right to thank them afterwards you mean, after we've seen what they've written? Replied <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>: `` No, right now, and they will write better.''

 _ Prime Minister <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Fenech </PERSON> <PERSON> Adami </PERSON> forecast no problems for <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION> because of the stormy weather that drove the shipboard summit to the side of the dock `` For <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION> itself, the summit has been very positive. It has shown <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION> can cope even with the necessary organization for a summit like this. Some people were skeptical that <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION> could do it. I think we proved ourselves,'' he said in a post-summit interview. `` As for the weather, well, I do n't mind the weather at all. If anything it has proved I was correct when I suggested that the meetings should not be held in <LOCATION> Marsaxlokk </LOCATION> but in some other bay, such as Grand Harbor which is much more protected than <PERSON> Marsaxlokk </PERSON> <PERSON> Bay </PERSON>,'' he said. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Cachia </PERSON> <PERSON> Caruana </PERSON>, an aide to the prime minister who was in charge of the Maltese organization for the summit, acknowledged the television images of giant waves crashing against the rocks below the 16th Century fortifications at <LOCATION> Valletta </LOCATION> probably would hurt the island's tourism objectives. But he said the country's primary public relations objective, especially in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, was to improve <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION>'s name identification. `` Just being at the center of the world stage for two days in a way helped give us that anyway,'' he said. `` Rather than riding tourism, we are pushing business opportunity. That is where name identification is essential,'' he said. `` If you can cope with a summit, it suggests your infastructure is not that weak.''

 The shooting started before dawn after a police officer tripped, accidentally firing his weapon. When it was over, 20 years ago Monday, two Black Panther leaders were dead and a new black movement was born. The chaotic police raid marked the beginning of the end for the radical black-liberation group, whose national membership numbered about 4,000 then. But the assault also helped usher in a new era of black political strength in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, several community leaders said. Illinois Panther leaders <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Hampton </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON>, both in their early 20s, were gunned down in the raid Dec. 4, 1969, by 14 police officers who had been looking for weapons and claimed that they had begun firing in self-defense after they were fired upon. After the officer tripped and set off his firearm, police fired 98 rounds into <PERSON> Hampton </PERSON>'s apartment in 15 minutes. In addition to the two who were killed, four other Panthers were wounded. Two policemen also were injured. One shot was fired from inside, it was later determined, but it did not strike anyone. Community leaders say the raid and the outrage it engendered helped unify black voters. `` We all knew'' <ORGANIZATION> Cook </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION>'s Attorney <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Hanrahan </PERSON> had ordered the raid, said <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Jefferson </PERSON>, who heads the <ORGANIZATION> Midwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> serving the city's <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Side </LOCATION>. When <PERSON> Hanrahan </PERSON>, a Democrat, sought re-election, black voters helped <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> opponent <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Carey </PERSON> defeat him. That began independent politics for <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> blacks, Ms. <PERSON> Jefferson </PERSON> said. `` The community had been splintered or totally in the camp of the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>,'' said real estate agent <PERSON> Dempsey </PERSON> <PERSON> Travis </PERSON>, who has written books on black community life in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, where the population is about 40 percent black. `` With the murder of <LOCATION> Hampton </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Clark </PERSON>, blacks did a 180-degree turn.'' Ms. <PERSON> Jefferson </PERSON> says the black support that ensured the late <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Washington </PERSON>'s 1983 election as the city's first black mayor was a direct result of changes sparked by the raid. Today, violence still stalks the Panthers. In August, <PERSON> Huey </PERSON> <PERSON> Newton </PERSON> _ a former leader whose story includes a doctorate in philosophy and a manslaughter charge _ was gunned down in <LOCATION> Oakland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, where the movement began. Police believe a man killed <PERSON> Newton </PERSON> to win favor with a drug-dealing street gang. Few reminders are left of the angry, determined young blacks who burst on the scene in the late 1960s, in the shadow of the non-violent civil-rights movement. <PERSON> Hampton </PERSON>'s apartment building is an abandoned hulk. But 20 years ago, the Panther's rhetoric and radical politics were fiery, uncompromising and scary. The Panthers were widely viewed as criminals, with their defiantly displayed firearms _ touted as defenses against police oppression _ and rallying cries of `` Off the pigs!'' and `` Power to the people!'' <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> Director <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Edgar </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoover </PERSON> called them `` the most dangerous and violence-prone of all extremist groups.'' But the image always has been disputed. `` They were a self-defense group. But the media portrayed them as if they were a gang,'' says <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Hampton </PERSON>, <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Hampton </PERSON>'s brother In <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, they challenged a corrupt political machine. Mayor <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Daley </PERSON> was undisputed boss of the city. On the largely black West Side, white ward committeemen answered to the mayor. `` There was a slave mentality in blacks when it came to politics,'' Ms. <PERSON> Jefferson </PERSON> recalled, and the <ORGANIZATION> Panthers </ORGANIZATION> `` attempted to address the political climate at the time.'' The Panthers launched community programs, providing breakfasts for hungry children, blood drives and a `` liberation school.'' But the weapons and rhetoric made the headlines and drew police attention. On Dec. 3, 1969, <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> Panther leaders met at <PERSON> Hampton </PERSON>'s apartment to discuss political and other concerns, said <PERSON> Alderman </PERSON> <PERSON> Bobby </PERSON> <PERSON> Rush </PERSON>, a former Panther defense minister `` All of us were going to spend the night ... but it was too crowded and some of us decided to break up and go home,'' <PERSON> Rush </PERSON> recalled. The shooting started before the sun came up. There were several investigations, including one by former <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney General <PERSON> Ramsey </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON>. No one was convicted of any crime, though the families of the dead and wounded <ORGANIZATION> Panthers </ORGANIZATION> shared a modest settlement from the city 14 years later.

 Soviets learned from state-run media Sunday of the arrest of former East German leaders and resignation of that country's Communist leadership, and of <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>'s stand on the 1968 <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pact </ORGANIZATION> invasion. The <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> news agency and the Sunday evening TV news program `` Seven Days'' told of the latest changes sweeping <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> in reports that were dominated by the summit of President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> reported Sunday's expulsion of <PERSON> Erich </PERSON> <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON> and others from the <ORGANIZATION> East </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> German </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and the resignation of the entire party <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> and Politburo. <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON> was ousted as party leader on Oct. 18. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said some former East German officials were accused of `` doing great damage to national property and the country's economy through abuse of power.''

<TEXT>
 Here are excerpts from an informal question-and-answer session that President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> held Sunday with reporters after his joint press conference with Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> at the conclusion of their two-day summit. Q. This goal ... you set for yourself, at least toward moving towards an end to the Cold War _ he -LRB- <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> -RRB- said an epoch has ended. How do you feel about that? A. I think this is a major step towards understanding and towards any _ in trying to tear down any remaining barriers that shot up because of the Cold War. There's no question that the conditions today are far different than at the depths of the Cold War. No question about it. I have n't even heard anybody argue to the contrary. Q. Mr. President, what do you think of <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact evolving to political organizations and really moving out of a military mode? A. Well, if we make the progress that I hope we'll make on various arms control items and if tensions continue to go down, as they have, inside the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and in terms of relations with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, who knows where the change will take us. But obviously, I have a certain responsibility for keeping <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> strong, and nothing here has altered that desire. But as you see the historical changes taking place, I think it's fine to envision a group of countries that spend a lot more time worrying about the economic side and less on the defense side. We are not there yet. We are not there. ... Q. What will you tell the <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> leaders? A. Well, I'll wait until I get there to decide that. I'll give them a pretty good report on what went on in considerable detail _ not all necessarily, because some relates to the US-Soviet equation. But we'll have a good, frank discussion, and I think they will be pleased at what the results of the meeting are. Q. Mr. President, other than the weather, were there any disappointments? You seem to still be at odds, very much so, on <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. And was there anything Mr. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> told you that especially surprised or pleased you? A. No, no surprises. And, I _ but as I say ... we can not in, you know, 10 hours of discussion or whatever it is, solve all the problems that exist between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, and the way we look at different areas. But, it's _ it would be euphorically optimistic to think that a meeting like this would solve all those problems. But it's better, we understand more. I've got some areas where I can now go back to him, various areas But there were no surprises. It was a wide discussion _ I'm not sure we left out any subjects in a geopolitical sense, but we covered a lot of them. ... Q. Disappointments -- no specific disappointments? Something you wish he was more forthcoming on? A. No particular disappointments, no. ... Because I think the _ I think the goal now is to go forward, as we have wanted to anyway, and demonstrate everybody's commitment to <ORGANIZATION> CFE </ORGANIZATION> talks; everybody's commitment to chemical weapons reductions, eventual elimination; and of course, the START agenda ... Q. Now, now having a better understanding of Mr. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> after this meeting, could you tell us what you know about him today, or understand about him today? A. Well, I know that he's perfectly willing to have very frank discussions, even if I'm on the opposite side of a question from him. There was no anger, there was no vitriol. It was a very constructive set of meetings in that regard. And so, I saw a man who is confident. I saw a man who was calm in our _ in his presentations, and responded as factually as he could in some of the questions I raised. And so, I am convinced that the concept of getting together for a `` no agenda meeting'' was very, very sound. Q. Do you think that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> now are dealing with each other more as allies than adversaries? A. I would n't say allies, but with far less misunderstanding, and with far more common goals. Q. What do you think of the adversarial relationship, of the nature of the relationship now? A. Well, I say _ as I say I think it's vastly improved, tensions reduced _ not eliminated but reduced. We still have different ways of looking at certain questions, and _ but I think the answer is improved. Q. Mr. President, relatives of <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- Flight -RRB- 103 bombing were going to have a ceremony in the harbor today, drop flowers into the harbor as part of their attempt to have both you and Mr. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> work together in fighting international terrorism. Did this come up specifically this weekend? Did you talk a little bit about it? A. Not 103 per se, but you're talking about anti-international terror. Yes, it did, and also in the anti-narcotics efforts. So there's more we can do. We did n't discuss it specifically, but I'm thinking about certain kinds of intelligence interchange that can prove to be beneficial ... Q. Secretary <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, before he came out here a couple weeks ago, said that the Soviet role in <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> was the primary obstacle to a more beneficial full-scale relationship between the two countries. You agree -- now you disagreed here, but did you advance the issue at all? MORE

 President <PERSON> Sheik </PERSON> <PERSON> Zayed </PERSON> <PERSON> bin </PERSON> <PERSON> Sultan </PERSON> <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Nahyan </PERSON> on Sunday denounced the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> as the `` Arabs' No. 2 enemy,'' saying it supports <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> at the expense of the Palestinians. `` <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> is our No. 1 enemy, and <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> is our No. 2 enemy,'' he told a news conference at the culmination of nationwide celebrations marking the 18th anniversary of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Emirates </LOCATION>. `` <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> supports <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> in its intransigence against the rightful cause of the Palestinians,'' <PERSON> Sheik </PERSON> <PERSON> Zayed </PERSON> said. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> stands to lose the friendship of 21 Arab powers by `` exaggerating its support for <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>,'' he said. Otherwise, he said, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Emirates </LOCATION> `` has warm and friendly relations with <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>.'' Answering a wide range of questions by <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> and foreign reporters, the sheik lauded Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> for introducing `` appreciable changes'' for his people. But he cautioned the Arabs against hinging any hopes on the U.S.-Soviet summit talks, contending that `` the two superpowers care more about their own interests and less about everything else.'' The 71-year-old president rejected the concept of <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> unity as a `` meaningless hallucination.'' He stressed that ideas of `` integration or cooperation are far more meaningful.'' `` I have been hearing the term unity for 40 years now but have seen nothing real, nothing tangible, of it,'' he said. `` We have opted for cooperation, as opposed to unity in the common sense of the term in our parlance.'' He was referring to the creation of the <ORGANIZATION> Gulf </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cooperation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, a six-nation economic integration and collective defense pact grouping <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Bahrain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oman </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Qatar </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Emirates </LOCATION>.

 It's a feud fit for the Old West. Sen. <PERSON> Max </PERSON> <PERSON> Baucus </PERSON>, D-Mont., thought it would be a good idea to celebrate the 100th birthdays of six <LOCATION> Northwest </LOCATION> states with a commemorative coin <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> turned 100 years old this year, and <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> will hit the century mark in 1990. But <PERSON> Baucus </PERSON>' insistence that some of the coins be made of palladium, a metal mined only in his home state, led to a standoff with the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Mint that has all but doomed his plan. The Mint opposed minting any coins for the six states, arguing at a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> hearing in October that there already were too many commemorative issues. The Mint particularly opposed using palladium, contending the silver-white metal used in automobile catalytic converters is too hard to mint. Representatives of coin collectors agreed with the Mint, and the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> last week approved a silver-only issue of a million coins. But the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, which has approved <PERSON> Baucus </PERSON>' palladium plan at least four times, accepted <PERSON> Baucus </PERSON>' demand that at least 175,000 coins be made of palladium. Earlier he had proposed 350,000. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> passed <PERSON> Baucus </PERSON>' plan Nov. 22 shortly before <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> adjourned this year's session. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, however, refused to back down and sent the bill back to the <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> that rejected <PERSON> Baucus </PERSON>' idea in the first place. It is not expected to be the committee's top priority. `` It may be a dead issue, frankly,'' <PERSON> Baucus </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON> said. Interest in the bill has been focused in the delegations of <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>, the two states with the most to gain. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>, for example, has been more concerned with getting a coin approved for the 50th anniversary of Mount Rushmore National Memorial. <PERSON> Baucus </PERSON> accuses silver-producing states like <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, which produces a quarter of the nation's supply, of sabotaging his idea. `` It was an issue of equity,'' <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON> said. `` It was <PERSON> Max </PERSON>'s bill, and we were being disinvited to participate in it.

 An oil tanker was sinking Sunday in the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION>, and heavy seas threatened to smash it onto rocks and cause the worst oil spill in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s history, officials said. About 30 to 60 tons of fuel and oil already have leaked, they said. The oil covered the beaches along this resort town north of <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION>. `` It looks like a ... street paved on the beach,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Environment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> director <PERSON> Uri </PERSON> <PERSON> Marinov </PERSON>. `` But it is zero compared to what will happen if all 600 tons come out.'' The Israeli-owned Eyal, carrying 660 tons of heavy oil, developed engine problems Thursday en route from the northern port of <LOCATION> Haifa </LOCATION> to the port of <LOCATION> Ashdod </LOCATION> in the south.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and Soviet Leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> wrapped up two days of superpower summitry on Sunday, claiming strides toward a new era of East-West peace but underscoring differences that linger at the end of a 45-year Cold War. Both men said they would meet again next year in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, and expressed the hope _ but not the certainty _ they would be able to sign historic agreements in 1990 to cut long range nuclear weapons and conventional forces in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and make progress toward a chemical weapons ban. `` We stated, both of us, that the world leaves one epoch of Cold War and enters another epoch,'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said at an unprecedented joint news conference that marked the end of two days of storm-tossed talks held aboard a Soviet luxury liner. `` We are just at the very beginning of our long road to a long-lasting peaceful period.'' Said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> after his first summit as president: `` I am optimistic that as the West works patiently together and increasingly cooperates with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, we can realize a lasting peace and transform the <LOCATION> East-West </LOCATION> relationship into one of enduring cooperation.'' Even so, neither man sought to gloss over differences on two topics, the Soviets' call for cuts in naval forces and <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> anger at the continued flow of Soviet weapons to leftist rebels in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> departed <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION> for <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, where he was convening a meeting of virtually an entirely new lineup of <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact leaders to discuss the summit. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> went immediately to <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION> to meet with <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> leaders on Monday. Arriving in <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION>, he noted the `` thunderous events'' taking place in the Eastern bloc, and said, `` Tonight we stand at the crossroads of history on a way to <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, whole and free ... And that simple truth brought <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and me together in a windswept harbor off <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION>.'' Windswept it was. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, who spent the night aboard ship in the harbor, sported penny-size patches behind their ears to guard against seasickness. The joint news conference in <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION> was held aboard the Soviet luxury liner Maxim Gorky, which was pressed into service as the site for the two days of talks after bad weather forced cancellation of plans to use <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet warships anchored offshore. An afternoon session and a dinner on Saturday were canceled because of the rough weather. The two superpower leaders met for eight hours over two days at a time of extraordinary change in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. The upheaval was dramatized in the summit's final hours by the resignation of the East German leadership and the formation of a new government in <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> that opposition leaders immediately denounced as too much like the old one. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said he was `` encouraged and inspired'' by the changes in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s acceptance of the changes there `` lays to rest previous doctrines,'' under which the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> had asserted a right to intervene militarily in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. Still, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> at one point said that he opposed `` artificially'' speeding up the process, a reference to proposals for the reunification of <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> _ a plan strongly opposed by the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. `` There were no surprises,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told reporters shortly before leaving this Mediterranean island nation. He said he thought the session had helped him and the Soviet leader better size each other up as individuals. Asked about <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s desire for naval arms reductions, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he was `` disinclined to think that is an area where we will make immediate progress'' and that `` We still have differences with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. He knows it and I know it, as it relates to naval forces.'' On the issue of <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, where the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has complained about the continued flow of Soviet-bloc arms to Marxist rebels in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will stand by its assertion that these weapons are still reaching the rebels _ most likely being supplied by <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s allies in the region, <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. `` I will not be satisfied until total self-determination takes places through verifiably free elections in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said the Soviets also supported free elections in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. But, he said, `` We have reaffirmed once again to the president that we have ceased arms shipments to Central America.''

 Buoyed by a cordial summit atmosphere, President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said they planned to rendezvous again in June and said their foreign ministers would speed work on three arms-control treaties. `` If a meeting can improve relations, I think this one has,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told the news conference aboard the Soviet passenger ship <PERSON> Maxim </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorky </PERSON>. Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> and Soviet Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> are to meet next month in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> to accelerate work on the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty -LRB- START -RRB-, a treaty on Conventional Forces in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> -LRB- CFE -RRB-, and chemical weapons, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said at an unprecedented joint news conference. Another Baker-Shevardnadze meeting is scheduled at a multinational conference in <LOCATION> Ottawa </LOCATION> next February, and a third was possible before June, perhaps in <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>'s native <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, in the southern <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, said Soviet officials. The next summit, said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, `` will drive the arms control agenda. And that's a good thing, because I represented to him that we wanted to see a START agreement, a <ORGANIZATION> CFE </ORGANIZATION> agreement, and hopefully, a chemical agreement. That's a very ambitious agenda.'' The most important result of the <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION> summit may not be the accelerated timetable on arms deals, but the sense that the two leaders were working together to improve U.S.-Soviet relations and solve conflicts around the world. `` I could not have asked for a better result out of this non-summit summit,'' said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. `` A better U.S.-Soviet relationship is to be valued in and of itself, but it also should be an instrument of positive change in the world,'' he said. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, describing the news conference as the first ever organized for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet leaders to hold jointly, said, `` We made good contact. The atmosphere was friendly, straightforward, open, and this enabled us to make good work.'' `` We stated, both of us, that the world leaves the one epoch of Cold War and enters another epoch,'' he added. `` We are just at the very beginning of our long road to a longlasting peaceful period.'' Despite the visionary words, many hard issues remain if the two sides are to complete the three proposed treaties. On START, which would cut long-range superpower nuclear arsenals by 30 to 50 percent, to 6,000 warheads apiece, they disagree over how to count air-launched cruise missiles, how to handle undeployed missiles, and over <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> allegations that the Soviets have encoded data transmissions from ballistic missile tests in violation of previous arms accords. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> was optimistic, however. `` As to strategic offensive arms, the analysis of the situation and the instructions that have been given regarding the preparation of that treaty demonstrate that we may be able by the second half of June _ and we agreed on the formal meeting at that time to do the necessary work _ to agree on the basic provisions of this treaty, which then later in the coming months would be ready for a signature,'' he said. `` In connection with the new interesting proposals by President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> regarding chemical weapons which have the goal of a global ban and provides for certain phases and movement towards this global ban, then we have the possibility of a rapid movement towards it,'' said <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. On Saturday, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> change a chemical weapons proposal he made at the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> last September, offering to stop production of a new generation of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> chemicals in the first year of a proposed 40-nation convention to ban such substances. Previously, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had planned to continue such production. In the conventional arms talks, which would remove 30,000 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and 325,000 Soviet troops from <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, and control tanks and other weapons, the two sides remain divided over how to count warplanes. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> has proposed that such an agreement be signed by the end of 1990 at a summit of the 35-nations of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. The leaders took the next steps toward a conventional arms deals immediately their summit, as the American president flew to <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION> to consult with his allies in the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> headed to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> to brief leaders of the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said that if the Soviet legislature passes a liberalized emigration law, as advocated by <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, he will recommend trade favors designed to ease the pressure on the Soviet economy and bolster <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> political reforms. `` There is enormous support in our country for what Chairman <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> is doing inside the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. There is enormous support for the way he has advocated peaceful change in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. `` For example, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> now seeks greater engagement in the international market economy, a step that certainly I'm prepared to encourage in any way I can,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> that he would recommend <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> grant the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> most-favored nation status, easing tariffs on Soviet exports to <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, and ending a sanction imposed 15 years ago to encourage the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> to ease Jewish emigration. The liberalized emigration law is expected to clear the Soviet parliament in January or February, and the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> on Soviet Jewery announced Sunday that Jewish emigration from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> reached an all-time high in November, 11,169, suprassing the previous high of 9,450 set in October. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> president also promised to work to obtain a longtime Soviet goal of obtaining observer status in the General Agreement on Trade and Tariffs, a decision that must be made by the 97-nation group, but which the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> can influence heavily.

 Four intoxicated young men apparently trying to be funny dug up a body from a cemetery and took it to the home of a sleeping acquaintance, who woke up, failed to see the humor and called police. `` We got drunk, went to the graveyard and dug up a body,'' one of the four, <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Kramer </PERSON>, 18, of <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Wenatchee </LOCATION>, said in an interview before he was taken to jail. `` It was like a prank, to freak out some friends. But now that I'm sober, I ca n't believe I did it.'' The four were booked Friday night for investigation of opening a grave, stealing a body, receiving a body and mutilating human remains. Each is a felony carrying a maximum penalty of three years in prison and a $ 1,000 fine. The remains removed from <LOCATION> Hamilton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cemetery </LOCATION> were those of a woman who died sometime between 1910 and 1920, said <LOCATION> Douglas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> sheriff's detective <PERSON> Rich </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>. The youths `` had been drinking and they decided it would be neat to see what a body looked like after that length of time,'' <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> said. `` One thing led to another and they decided ... to take the body from the grave to a house in <LOCATION> Wenatchee </LOCATION>.'' The body's head and finger bones allegedly were removed, `` for what purpose we do n't know,'' he said.

 Communist leader <PERSON> Egon </PERSON> <PERSON> Krenz </PERSON> and his entire government resigned on Sunday, and a 25-member panel of reformers took over temporary leadership in a desperate effort to rescue the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. The historic action, announced by megaphone to a wildly cheering crowd, stripped power from <ORGANIZATION> Krenz </ORGANIZATION> less than six weeks after he replaced hard-liner <PERSON> Erich </PERSON> <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON>. <PERSON> Krenz </PERSON> was left off the new panel, which will control <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s ruling party until a party congress later this month. It was the shortest reign of any leader in the country's history However, <ORGANIZATION> Krenz </ORGANIZATION> retains the largely ceremonial position of president. The Communists also expelled <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON> from the party he had led for 18 years and announced that three ousted Politburo members had been arrested on corruption charges. A top state trade official fled the country. Hundreds of thousands of East Germans linked hands across the country to form a human chain intended to increase pressure for quicker democratic reforms and to protest corruption in Communist Party ranks. In neighboring <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>, leaders included non-Communists in the government for the first time in 21 years, but angered opposition leaders said there were too many Communist holdovers on the new Cabinet. They vowed to resume pro-democracy protests. Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> praised the changes under way in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> as he ended his two-day summit with President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. `` I think -LRB- it -RRB- is something we should welcome because it's connected with the desire of these peoples to ennoble their societies, to make them more democratic, humanitarian, to open up the rest of the world,'' he said Under pressure from mass demonstrations and the exodus of thousands, <ORGANIZATION> Krenz </ORGANIZATION> took over on Oct. 18 and opened the <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Wall </LOCATION> on Nov. 9. He promised democratic reforms including free elections, but there were increased calls for his ouster even within the party because of his past links to <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON>'s rule. He was jeered Saturday by party members who demanded his resignation. The new committee will run party affairs until a special party congress Dec. 15-17 and prepare for that congress. Its role in governing the country was not immediately clear. <PERSON> Guenter </PERSON> <PERSON> Schabowski </PERSON> announced the resignations of the 10-man Politburo and the 163-member, policy-making <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> by megaphone to 10,000 cheering people who stood outside the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> building. `` The Politburo accepts the criticism raised by a large number of party members that the current leadership is not capable of uncovering the entire scope of serious mistakes of the members of the former Politburo and to draw the necessary consequences,'' he said. <PERSON> Schabowski </PERSON>, who was one of those who resigned from the Politburo, was considered a reformer, but like all of the ousted officials, he was not named to the new committee. Officials made it clear the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> actions were meant to convince the populace the party is truly intent on jettisoning its tainted image and fulfilling demands for political and economic reforms. `` We want to form a modern Socialist party guided by the rank and file. We want to save this country. We want to save socialism,'' said <PERSON> Gregor </PERSON> <PERSON> Gysi </PERSON>, a prominent <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> lawyer and spokesman for the new 25-member committee. <PERSON> Gysi </PERSON> said the panel's first act was to set up a commission to examine `` violations of the party's statutes and laws by former and current functionaries of the party.'' The new panel includes reformers such as former spymaster <PERSON> Markus </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Dresden </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Wolfgang </PERSON> <PERSON> Berghofer </PERSON> and the panel's chairman, <LOCATION> Erfurt </LOCATION> party chief <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Kroker </PERSON>. <PERSON> Kroker </PERSON> said the leadership was forced to resign because `` of its inability to develop a constructive policy for the renewal of socialism.'' <PERSON> Gysi </PERSON> said Premier <PERSON> Hans </PERSON> <PERSON> Modrow </PERSON>, also a reformer, declined an offer to join the committee because his current work already takes up most of his time. <PERSON> Schabowski </PERSON> also announced the ouster from the party of <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON> and 11 other disgraced officials following disclosures of corruption among top party ranks. Others thrown out of the party included former Premier <PERSON> Willi </PERSON> <PERSON> Stoph </PERSON>, ex-security chief <PERSON> Erich </PERSON> <PERSON> Mielke </PERSON> and former <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> speaker <PERSON> Horst </PERSON> <PERSON> Sindermann </PERSON>. The 12 are suspected of `` serious violations of party statutes,'' <PERSON> Schabowski </PERSON> said. The widening investigations of corruption led to the arrests of three former Politburo members. <PERSON> Guenter </PERSON> <PERSON> Mittag </PERSON> and <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Tisch </PERSON>, who had been key Politburo members under <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON>, were arrested and accused of `` heavily damaging socialist property and the people's economy through abuse of power,'' the state-run news service <ORGANIZATION> ADN </ORGANIZATION> said. <PERSON> Gerhard </PERSON> <PERSON> Mueller </PERSON>, former party leader in the city of <LOCATION> Erfurt </LOCATION> and former candidate, or non-voting, member of the Politburo, was arrested under similar suspicions, <ORGANIZATION> ADN </ORGANIZATION> said. <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Schalck-Golodkowski </PERSON>, a state secretary in the foreign trade ministry, fled the country after authorities opened an investigation into suspected corruption by him, ADN reported. <PERSON> Mittag </PERSON> was expelled from the party last month, while <PERSON> Tisch </PERSON>, <PERSON> Mueller </PERSON> and <PERSON> Schalck-Golodkowski </PERSON> were kicked out Sunday. <ORGANIZATION> ADN </ORGANIZATION> said that 30 other criminal probes into allegations of corruption had been opened, but it did not give any names. <PERSON> Schalck-Golodkowski </PERSON> was <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s chief trade negotiator and headed the Commercial Coordination department, which has been responsible for acquiring hard currency. The investigation was opened after Saturday's discovery of a secret operation to ship weapons to the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. Hard-currency earnings from the sales went to the country's foreign trade bank addressed to <ORGANIZATION> Schalck-Golodkowski </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> ADN </ORGANIZATION> said, without mentioning how much money was involved

<HEAD>Oswego State Kicks Off `Bias Busters' Campaign to Combat Bigotry</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Note language in 6th graf.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OSWEGO, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A bulletin board announcement of open season on blacks and other racial incidents have led the a state college here to start a `` bias busters'' campaign to combat campus bigotry. The campaign starting Sunday at the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Oswego </LOCATION> is an effort to confront what college leaders say is a nationwide trend. `` Do I think this will help? Yes. Do I think this will solve the problem? No. But we've got to do what we can,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Oswego </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Weber </PERSON>. The first step in stopping bigotry and prejudice is to acknowledge it exists, <PERSON> Weber </PERSON> said. Officials of the 7,600-student college 35 miles north of <LOCATION> Syracuse </LOCATION> said the `` bias busters'' campaign is aimed at getting students to take a public stance when they witness incidents of racism or bigotry. `` The whole point of what we're trying to do is to get to the silent majority which by its silence condones these acts,'' <PERSON> Weber </PERSON> said. Just before Thanksgiving, an announcement pinned to a bulletin board in a campus dormitory said it was open season on `` porch monkeys,'' and contained other racial slurs. `` If they're going to tell you that they're going to hunt you down and kill you, that's scary,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Syracuse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION> American quoted a senior from the <LOCATION> Dominican </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> as saying. She said she found the notice posted outside her dorm room. Black students are not the only targets. Two weeks ago, a gay student was threatened and the tires on his car slashed. Another student said he was considering moving out of his dorm because of harassment he receives for being openly gay. `` Bias busters'' can wear a lapel pin bearing the word bias surrounded by a circle with a slash through the center. In addition, bias reduction workshops will be offered throughout the year, to help participants identify their own prejudices and work on getting rid of them, said <PERSON> Catherine </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>, a workshop coordinator. `` It's not a case where you're going to change the world, but if you change, people around you will see that and react to it,'' she said. `` If you make it known that you do n't want to hear racist and sexist jokes, then people wo n't tell them around you.'' Some students felt that prejudice was too widespread and entrenched to be much affected by slogans and buttons. Others feel the campaign would raise public consciousness about the issue. `` I think most people do n't think there's racial problems on this campus, and that's not the truth,'' said <PERSON> Emilio </PERSON> <PERSON> Dorcely </PERSON>, vice president of the campus student association. `` It's no better or no worse than anyplace else, but it could be better _ and this campaign is a positive approach to the problem.'' <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Pogue </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION>'s vice chancellor for student affairs and special programs, said anti-bias programs have been instituted and more are planned for <ORGANIZATION> SUNY </ORGANIZATION>'s 64 campuses, the nation's largest state university system. `` Our approach is to prevent rather than react,'' <PERSON> Pogue </PERSON> said. `` Any one occurrence of bias-related activity on a college campus is too many.''

<HEAD>Ritz Hotel of France Battles Iowan over Toilet Name</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A man named <PERSON> Ritzer </PERSON> would naturally be nicknamed Ritz, and would be likely to give his nickname to something he invented. So argues <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Ritzer </PERSON>, who invented a potty training toilet seat and called it the Rit-Z. But the people who guard the reputation of the famed <ORGANIZATION> Ritz </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hotel </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> think <PERSON> Ritzer </PERSON> is trying to use their name without permission. The hotel people asked the <ORGANIZATION> Trademark </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Patent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trademark </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> to order <PERSON> Ritzer </PERSON> to stop using their name. `` It's been one nightmare after another,'' said <PERSON> Ritzer </PERSON>, 48, of <LOCATION> Arnolds </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>, in northwestern <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>. `` I think what's really happening here is that the big <ORGANIZATION> Ritz </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hotel </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> is trying to put a hurtin' on the little <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> toilet seat company.'' But <PERSON> Ritz </PERSON> president <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Klein </PERSON>, who flew to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> to testify in the case in October, said <PERSON> Ritzer </PERSON> represents a genuine threat. `` The Ritz Hotel in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> stands for privacy, for perfection, for discretion,'' he testified. `` The Ritz had such a reputation for over the last 80 years that whatever we do ... whatever is matched with our name, has to be in a perfect way.'' Thus, he said, <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foods </ORGANIZATION> paid the <ORGANIZATION> Ritz </ORGANIZATION> for use of its name on <ORGANIZATION> Ritz </ORGANIZATION> crackers. <PERSON> Klein </PERSON> said <PERSON> Ritzer </PERSON> deliberately cloned his hotel's name for the toilet seat. `` Why does the man put the name <PERSON> Ritz </PERSON> on it? Because he needs us as a signature. That's what he has done, the man is not stupid. What else could work better than the name <PERSON> Ritz </PERSON>?'' <PERSON> Klein </PERSON> testified. The trouble began two years ago when <PERSON> Ritzer </PERSON> applied for a patent and trademark on his invention. The patent was granted but the Ritz Hotel filed formal opposition to the name Rit-Z after one of its attorneys noticed the request in a routine review of trademark applications. Lawyers on both sides said they do n't expect a decision for several months. <PERSON> Ritzer </PERSON> said the name came naturally and has nothing to do with the hotel. <PERSON> Ritz </PERSON>, he said, is `` the nickname everybody in the <PERSON> Ritzer </PERSON> family has had for generations and I put it on the toilet seat because it's short and easy to remember and because it's kind of an attention-getter.'' `` We never even gave a thought to the idea that someone might confuse our name and toilet seat with the Ritz Hotel.'' <PERSON> Ritzer </PERSON> gave his reply testimony last week in the office of his <LOCATION> Des </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Moines </LOCATION> lawyer, <PERSON> Edmund </PERSON> <PERSON> Sease </PERSON>. <PERSON> Ritzer </PERSON>, who operated a plumbing business in <LOCATION> Arnolds </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> for 25 years, explained that his family had trouble toilet training a daughter in the 1960s. She was afraid of the big toilet seat `` because she was afraid she'd fall in or somebody would flush it while she was up there,'' he said. `` I got to thinking there just has to be a better way to combine the ideas of toilet seats and toilets and potty chairs to make it easier for the little kids.'' So he made a toilet seat with an extra ring that could be pulled down to accommodate infants' smaller bottoms. Other people wanted one, so four years ago, he said, he sold the plumbing business to his son and started the three-employee toilet seat business. The double-ring seat has been marketed to hardware stores and children's furniture stores. The Ritzers say they have sold between 3,000 and 4,000 in the last 18 months.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said Sunday the superpower summit helped erase <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s doubts about the intentions of a new American president toward the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and its political and economic reforms. `` I do n't think he has me down as a total negativist at all and I certainly do n't have him down'' that way, said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who has weathered criticism at home and in the Kremlin for his guarded approach toward changes in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said the two days of talks gave him and <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> a chance to get to know one another. He added that as a result of their earlier meetings when he was vice president, the summit `` was probably less formidable than if I'd never met him ever.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was in high spirits as he spoke to half-a-dozen reporters aboard the Soviet luxury liner Maxim Gorky shortly before departing <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION>. He said he wrote humorous notes to 25 friends Saturday night, when bad weather forced cancellation of a dinner with the Soviets and left him stranded on an <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> warship anchored in the harbor. `` And funny, you'll die,'' he said, describing the correspondence. `` It's a whole new emotional, humorous side to this president.'' He said it was difficult to describe his personal feelings `` because I'm not the most articulate emotionalist. Turning his attention to <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, he said, `` He knows that I'm cautious `` You heard him use the word ` prudent' -LRB- to describe <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> -RRB-. I'm sure that was deliberate,'' the president said `` But I ca n't have asked for a better ambiance, a better feel from the meetings, even though the differences are acute in some areas.'' Commenting on dynamics of his talks, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` I'd like to think he thought I knew what I was talking about, so we could have a good exchange without having to go to the experts or go to the notebooks, and it worked.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> originally had conceived their meeting as a relaxed, feet-up, get acquainted session but the talks took on a new dimension in the wake of the collapse of hard-line communist regimes in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. Even so, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` At one moment I actually did put my foot up.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said that in <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, `` I saw a man who was confident, who was calm in his presentations.'' Contrary to some expectations, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said there were no surprises from <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> in their meetings. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> talked about the summit just minutes after holding a joint news conference with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and saying farewell to him on the Soviet cruise ship Maxim Gorky where they held eight hours of talks over two days. Talking with reporters in a small cabin on the ship, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> called the talks productive and constructive and said, `` it worked exactly as I expected.'' He said that six months ago, `` there was probably a misunderstanding about the intentions of this new president, and I think one of the good things is that I do n't think he has any feeling that I'm going to be unforthcoming in situations where I should be.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said the climate of the talks was radically different from when he first met <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, shortly before the Soviet leader came to power in 1985. `` I remember a time when I first met Mr. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and we talked about human rights and he became visibly agitated with me for raising it,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` I think there's been an evolution of his thinking ... and certainly in his relations with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, just as there's been an evolution in my thinking. White House press secretary <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> had responded positively on Saturday when <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> spelled out a package of proposals for dealing with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s attempts to overhaul its ailing economy and the upheaval in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> quoted <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> as telling <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, `` What you're telling me is that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> is not just satisfied to let this happen but is going to take an active role with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> in terms of economic and political reforms. Quoting <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> further, the spokesman reported, `` He said ` I am taking a prudent and cautious approach and I'm glad to hear you are, too.'''

 The new committee temporarily guiding <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s Communists includes the country's former spymaster, a lawyer for the New Forum opposition group, and several well-known reformers. It is faced with the seemingly impossible task of rescuing the embattled party. The 25-member `` working committee'' was announced Sunday after party leader <PERSON> Egon </PERSON> <PERSON> Krenz </PERSON>, the ruling Politburo, and the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> resigned. The best-known member of the committee is <PERSON> Markus </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON>, the retired and respected legendary spy chief, who stepped down in 1987 as deputy minister of state security. <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON> has become a major supporter of reforms but has also been criticized by opposition leaders who say he has `` too many skeletons'' in the closet. The head of the committee is <LOCATION> Erfurt </LOCATION> party chief <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Kroker </PERSON>, who was once stripped of various duties by <PERSON> Guenter </PERSON> <PERSON> Mittag </PERSON>, the economics czar under now-ousted leader <PERSON> Erich </PERSON> <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON>. Another member of the working committee is <PERSON> Gregor </PERSON> <PERSON> Gysi </PERSON>, well known as the attorney for the 200,000-strong New Forum opposition group. <PERSON> Gysi </PERSON> drafted the official petition seeking legal status for New Forum. No prominent New Forum members were appointed to the committee. <LOCATION> Dresden </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Wolfgang </PERSON> <PERSON> Berghofer </PERSON>, one of the first politicians to meet with New Forum, is also a member of the panel. Earlier this month, <PERSON> Berghofer </PERSON> was quoted widely in West German news media as giving an extremely gloomy forecast of the party's future, saying `` the people have taken power away from us. <PERSON> Berghofer </PERSON> was also quoted by <PERSON> Stern </PERSON> magazine as saying he was considering a challenge to <ORGANIZATION> Krenz </ORGANIZATION> for the post of party chief, although he later backed away from that position. The popular reformist premier, <PERSON> Hans </PERSON> <PERSON> Modrow </PERSON>, is not a member of the committee but will effectively be in charge of the government until a new Politburo and <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> are selected at a three-day congress starting Dec. 15. <PERSON> Modrow </PERSON> was asked to serve on the committee but said his job as premier kept him too busy. Like <PERSON> Kroker </PERSON>, the head of the committee, <PERSON> Modrow </PERSON> himself was the target of a Honecker-era inquisition and virtually exiled for years to his power base in <LOCATION> Dresden </LOCATION>.

 About 100 people, many in Confederate costumes and carrying Civil War-era weapons, gathered under gray skies to mark the centennial of the death of Confederate President <PERSON> Jefferson </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>. Although the 5-foot pedestal was once defaced with graffiti denouncing the statue as racist, no pickets or hecklers were around as a Marine band tuned up for the ceremonies Saturday. `` One of the main things I've tried to bring to the public's attention is that <PERSON> Jefferson </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> is always thought of as president of the Confederate States of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> but that people have no realization that that was four years out of his 80-year life,'' said <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>' great-great-grandson, <PERSON> Bertram </PERSON> <PERSON> Hayes-Davis </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> `` He was a great American patriot, a tremendous scholar and certainly one of the ablest leaders of that time.'' <PERSON> Jefferson </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> died Dec. 6, 1889. During his life, he was a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> representative and senator, a hero in the Mexican War, and a member of President <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>'s Cabinet, said <PERSON> Hayes-Davis </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Davis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Family </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>.

 A process that sets tiny bacteria to work gobbling up the sticky, black creosote found on scrap wood has become the focus of scientists and politicians concerned about the environmental hazards of offshore woodburning. Rep. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Saxton </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.J. </LOCATION>, announced last week that the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> agreed to put the hungry microorganisms to the test. `` Everything in nature apparently goes back to its original state at some point. There are little helpers that help it get there,'' he explained. `` I'm encouraged because the process is going to move forward.'' With a ban on offshore woodburning going into effect Jan. 1, 1991, <PERSON> Saxton </PERSON> and others have been looking for alternatives to disposing of telephone poles, railroad ties and driftwood by incineration or landfill. Thousands of tons of the wood _ about 97 percent of it treated with the unpleasant-smelling wood preservative _ are collected each year. The <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineers </ORGANIZATION> tears down old piers along <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION> to make way for redevelopment and the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> gathers driftwood from the harbor. The wood has been burned for two decades on barges about 20 miles off <LOCATION> Point </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pleasant </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, fueling concerns about air pollution. <PERSON> Saxton </PERSON> arranged a meeting in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> with regional <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> officials, the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION>, environmental officials from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> and Rep. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Pallone </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.J. </LOCATION>, to discuss the feasibility of so-called bioremediation. The process ideally would turn the wood into harmless sawdust that could be used as mulch. `` Hopefully, when the lab work is completed, we'll know whether it can be used on a large-scale basis, whether the end-product can be easily disposed of, and whether it is cost-effective,'' <PERSON> Saxton </PERSON> said. The bacterial process allows the microorganisms to feed on creosote until it is neutralized, he said. <PERSON> Saxton </PERSON> requested the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> meeting after a session at his <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> office with representatives of <ORGANIZATION> Alpha </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Austin </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Kuykendall </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Alpha </ORGANIZATION> executive vice president, said the firm often employs oil-eating bacteria in environmental cleanups. <PERSON> Saxton </PERSON>, a member of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Merchant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fisheries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, asked Alpha about applying their cleanup techniques to creosote. Using tiny quantities in an eight-day trial earlier this month, researchers in <LOCATION> Austin </LOCATION> were able to reduce phenol, the main element in creosote, by 80 percent in one batch of wood <PERSON> Saxton </PERSON> shipped from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>. They used organisms that occur naturally, said <PERSON> Kuykendall </PERSON>, a former congressman from <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION>. `` We got enough results that we felt we could go to Congressman <PERSON> Saxton </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Kuykendall </PERSON> said. `` I think the odds are better than 50-50 we could do something.'' Should the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> test phase prove promising, research would proceed to a full-scale demonstration with about 100 tons of wood, <PERSON> Kuykendall </PERSON> said.

 A woman says her secret to staying married for 70 years is quite simple: If you have an argument, do n't sweat it, forget it. <PERSON> Sylvester </PERSON> `` Bud'' <PERSON> Roach </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Jessie </PERSON>, were married in a simple ceremony on Dec. 4, 1919. For those 70 years, they've been inseparable, family members sayd. Mrs. <PERSON> Roach </PERSON>, 88, said she discovered how to get along with her husband when she was a newlywed. `` I learned a long time ago there was no use arguing with him,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Roach </PERSON> said. `` He could say whatever he wants to you, just forget he said it.'' The Roaches, who were celebrating Sunday with an open house, said their faith in God helped keep them together through major surgery and illness. `` I ca n't help but see the Lord had a hand in it,'' said <PERSON> Roach </PERSON>, 90. The pair were childhood friends while growing up in a small town in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>. But when he started courting her, `` her mom ran me off like a stray dog,'' he said. `` When the sun went down, it was time for me to go.'' The couple spent most of their first seven years together in <LOCATION> Swan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> in northern <LOCATION> Manitoba </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>. The nearest town, <LOCATION> Minitonas </LOCATION>, was four miles away. Two of their six children were born in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>. One was born without the assistance of a doctor because 4 feet of snow blanketed the countryside one 20-degree night. A neighbor came to help instead. A daughter, <PERSON> Juanita </PERSON> <PERSON> Tucker </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Hobart </LOCATION>, said her parents are kept private what disagreements they had. `` I ca n't imagine them being apart,'' she said. `` They live for each other.''

 <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s first post-summit business Monday will be to brief leaders of a radically reshaped <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact, and for the first time a non-communist will sit at the table. The appearance at the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> meeting of Polish Prime Minister <PERSON> Tadeusz </PERSON> <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON>, a Solidarity figure, will be a startling development. But tumultuous events in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> on Sunday lent an even greater aura of suspense to the meeting <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> will host. East German <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Egon </PERSON> <PERSON> Krenz </PERSON> and his entire Politburo resigned and a 25-member panel of reformers took over temporary leadership in a desperate effort to rescue the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Krenz </ORGANIZATION> relinquished a post he'd held less than six weeks. Although he retained the largely ceremonial title of president, it was unclear whether he would make the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> meeting and there was no early indication who would represent <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. What was known was that several Eastern European leaders will be attending their first <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact leadership meeting. These include <PERSON> Petar </PERSON> <PERSON> Mladenov </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Karel </PERSON> <PERSON> Urbanek </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>. In another first for the alliance, the head of the out-of-power <ORGANIZATION> Polish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> apparently will not be invited at all. Hardline leader <PERSON> Nicolae </PERSON> <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> is the only <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc leader to reject the epic transformations. With the recent fall of orthodox communist leaders like <PERSON> Erich </PERSON> <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON> in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Milos </PERSON> <PERSON> Jakes </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>, he is likely to find himself at this session to be more isolated than ever before. The meeting takes place in an atmosphere of ongoing crisis in the communist world. The entire East German Communist Party Politburo quit Sunday along with <ORGANIZATION> Krenz </ORGANIZATION>, and a new government unveiled Sunday in <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> failed to satisfy opponents, who pledged more mass demonstrations. It has been five months since top leaders of the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact last met June 7-8 in <LOCATION> Bucharest </LOCATION> and said that each member country had the `` right to make its own political lines, strategy and tactics without any outside interference.'' Since then, the Solidarity movement assumed the helm of <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s government, the <ORGANIZATION> Hungarian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> dissolved itself, <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> was forced to open the <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> Wall, Czechoslovakian communists have conceded past errors and promised free elections, and the bloc's longest-reigning hardliner, <PERSON> Todor </PERSON> <PERSON> Zhivkov </PERSON>, abruptly resigned after 35 years in power in <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION> and was replaced by a reformer The sweeping changes in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> were a centerpiece theme of the weekend discussions between <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on the Soviet passenger liner Maxim Gorky docked in <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Marsaxlokk </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>. Rather than expressing any anxiety about the changes in the region, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said at his joint news conference with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> after the summit that he welcomed them. `` I'm encouraged and inspired by all these processes,'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said. They are `` connected with the desire of these peoples to ennoble their societies, to make them more democratic and humanitarian and to open up to the rest of the world.'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said he and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> agreed `` that the world leaves one epoch of Cold War, and enters another epoch. This is just the beginning. We are just at the very beginning of our road, a long road to a long-lasting, peaceful period.'' The <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact, founded in the Polish capital in 1955 in response to the formation of the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION>, is itself an outgrowth of the Cold War. Now, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said, both the <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pact </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> will have to change. They `` should not remain military alliances, but rather military-political alliances and later on, just political alliances,'' he said. For his part, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he and <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> discussed the situation in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> in `` considerably more detail'' than he could disclose, and expressed broad approval. `` There is enormous support in our country for what Chairman <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> is doing inside the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` There is enormous respect and support for the way he has advocated peaceful change in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>.'' But he indicated that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> did not press for any sort of acceleration in the process. `` I do n't think it is a role for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to dictate the rapidity of change in any country. It's a matter for the people to determine themselves,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>East German Prison Inmates on Hunger Strike in Demand for Amnesty</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-East Germany, Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>EAST BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Inmates at several East German prisons are staging work stoppages and hunger strikes to demand a general amnesty in keeping with the spirit of reform sweeping the country, the state news agency said Sunday. The ADN news agency quoted spokesmen for an inmates' committees as saying prisoners should get a chance to start anew while the country is in the midst of its political changes. It was the second day that <ORGANIZATION> ADN </ORGANIZATION> reported prison unrest in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, where the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Politburo </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> resigned Sunday in the continuing political upheaval. ADN gave no figure on the number of prisoners involved in amnesty demands but said: `` The inmates of the -LRB- East -RRB- <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> prison have demanded better living conditions and more pay for their work.'' In earlier reports, it said inmates at prisons in <LOCATION> Bautzen </LOCATION> and near <LOCATION> Potsdam </LOCATION> had stopped working or gone on hunger strikes demanding amnesty, better living conditions and higher pay for work. ADN quoted one prisoner as saying, `` The real criminals, who have cheated the people out of millions, are free and have the possibility to avoid punishment.'' He was referring to disclosures by the ruling <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> that three ex-Politburo members have been arrested and charged with corruption and other former party officials are under investigation. <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> officials have acknowledged that inmates in prisons in <LOCATION> Leipzig </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Dresden </LOCATION> and at a youth reformatory in <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> an der <PERSON> Oder </PERSON> have made similar demands recently. ADN said striking prisoners have met with prison officials and representatives of <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> churches and opposition groups to discuss their grievances. In some cases, prison officials offered more liberal visiting rights and freer exchange of letters, <ORGANIZATION> ADN </ORGANIZATION> said. Overcrowding at the prison near <LOCATION> Potsdam </LOCATION> can be reduced by transferring 400 inmates to other facilities, it reported. Officials have rejected a general amnesty because of the seriousness of the offenses committed by some prisoners, according to ADN. It said many of the inmates at the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> prison were `` repeat offenders who had previously been set free under a general amnesty.'' The news agency did not say if any of the striking inmates were political prisoners.

<HEAD>Government Rejects Drug Trafficker Truce</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The government Sunday rejected a truce declared by drug traffickers in their bombing campaign and said accepting it would leave the country in the hands of the traffickers. `` We will continue battling them because if we do n't, we will cease to govern,'' Interior Minister <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Lemos </PERSON> <PERSON> Simmonds </PERSON> said. The <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> cocaine cartel has announced that beginning Monday, it will observe a `` cease-fire'' in its terrorist campaign with the aim of persuading <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to approve a national vote on the government's extradition policy. The government has extradited Colombian drug suspects to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> as part of a crackdown on cocaine cartels that began Aug. 18 after a leading presidential candidate and anti-drug crusader was assassinated. The administration of President <PERSON> Virgilio </PERSON> <PERSON> Barco </PERSON> so far has extradited nine suspects. The traffickers have responded with 200 bombings that have killed 29 people and injured 238. Barco departed Sunday for a four-day visit to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and after a farewell ceremony at the airport, <PERSON> Lemos </PERSON> <PERSON> Simmonds </PERSON> reiterated the administration's opposition to a national vote on its extradition policy. `` If the government accepted this proposal, the country would be left to be governed by the desires of drug traffickers,'' he told reporters. A congressional committee on Friday attached the referendum proposal to legislation that would reform <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s constitution. <PERSON> Lemos </PERSON> <PERSON> Simmonds </PERSON> accused members of the committee of being `` accomplices of drug trafficking.'' He said the traffickers would stage a violent campaign of intimidation if there were a national vote on extradition. <PERSON> Barco </PERSON> indicated Saturday that the government would prefer to kill the constitutional reform legislation rather than let it pass with the referendum bill attached. Abandoning reforms would endanger peace negotiations with the April M19 Movement, the only one of <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s five main guerrilla groups that has accepted an official peace plan. The legislation contains provisions for the guerrilla group to run candidates for <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. Its leader, <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Pizarro </PERSON>, has said the guerrillas would lay down their arms on Dec. 19, provided that the government passes the reform legislation.

 Gunmen opened fire on the information minister's convoy Sunday in southeast <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, police said. It was the second attack in two days on the official, who is a foe of Christian leader Gen. <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>. Police said no one was hurt in the shooting, which targeted Information Minister <PERSON> Edmond </PERSON> <PERSON> Rizk </PERSON> and his three-car convoy. On Saturday, a bomb was tossed at <PERSON> Rizk </PERSON>'s house in <LOCATION> Jezzine </LOCATION>. No one was hurt. <PERSON> Rizk </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Maronite </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION>, blamed the first attack on `` General <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> and agents recruited to undermine the whole of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>.'' He had no immediate comment after the second attack, carried out by several men with rifles. No one claimed responsibility for it. Also Sunday, Prime Minister <PERSON> Salim </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoss </PERSON> said <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> is leading <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> to `` national suicide'' but appeared to rule out a military attack to evict him from the presidential palace. In a statement to The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Hoss </PERSON> said that `` General <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> has become an outlaw, leading a mutiny that will result only in partitioning <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>.'' `` If he replaces the Taif accord, that will mean national suicide.'' The Taif accord is an Arab-brokered peace plan approved in October by <LOCATION> Lebanese </LOCATION> legislators who met in <LOCATION> Taif </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> opposes the accord because it does not include a timetable for withdrawal of Syrian troops from <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. The accord cleared the way for election of a president, and <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> chose <PERSON> Rene </PERSON> <PERSON> Mouawad </PERSON>. He was killed by a bomb after 17 days and was replaced by <PERSON> Elias </PERSON> <PERSON> Hrawi </PERSON>. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> rejected the presidential election and has refused to leave the presidential palace, which he took over last year after being named head of an interim military Cabinet pending a presidential election. He now is holding out with 20,000 troops in the Christian heartland north and northeast of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> last week added to its military strength in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> with massive reinforcements around the main gateways to the Christian region, sparking fears of a military move to evict <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>. At the superpower summit Sunday off the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> island of <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION>, Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said Sunday he agreed with President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> that the superpowers should do `` our very best'' to help bring peace to <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. `` There's a real chance of taking a decisive step to open a process of a settlement,'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> told a news conference. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said: `` We have found that the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> is playing a constructive role in the <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> and trying throughout the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>'' to support a settlement. He apparently was referring to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s influence with <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>. However, the two leaders made no specific proposals. `` We are determined to confront the <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> phenomenon ... because it is partitioning <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Hoss </PERSON> said. `` We shall use all peaceful political means available to end this mutiny.'' He said the cease-fire Sept. 22 that halted six months of fighting between <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s forces and <LOCATION> Syrian </LOCATION> troops must be backed up politically. `` We do not want to go back to war, but we should not forget the cruel lessons we have learned that a truce can not be translated into peace and stability unless it is coupled with political reconciliation to solve the crisis,'' <PERSON> Hoss </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>'s troops were deployed in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> under a 1976 <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> mandate to quell civil war fighting. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> contends they betrayed their mission by siding with the Moslems against the Christians in the 14-year-old civil war.

 Angolan rebel leader <PERSON> Jonas </PERSON> <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON> said he is ready to sign an immediate cease-fire with <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>'s Marxist government to end 14 years of civil war. <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON> spoke to reporters in <LOCATION> Kinshasa </LOCATION> on Saturday night after meetings with <LOCATION> Zaire </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Mobutu </PERSON> <PERSON> Sese </PERSON> <PERSON> Seko </PERSON>.

<TEXT>
 Former Housing Secretary <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> reportedly gave a $ 350,000 development grant to a friend for two <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> proposals that never went into operation, officials said Sunday. According to Housing and Urban Development documents, the 1985 grant was made to a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> consulting firm, the <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resource </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION>, even though other <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> officials had rejected the award, <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> reported in Sunday's editions. The firm's principal was <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Singletary </PERSON>, a longtime friend of <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>. The grant was made from one of two discretionary funds under <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>'s control, the Times reported. <PERSON> Singletary </PERSON> had managed <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>'s two unsuccessful campaigns for election as a judge in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> in 1959 and 1960. He told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> that he had met with <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> several times at <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION>, but had never discussed the grant. He denied that <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> had done him a favor. <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> told the Times through a lawyer, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Plotkin </PERSON>, that he did not remember the grant to <PERSON> Singletary </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> confirmed that there had been opposition to the grant to <PERSON> Singletary </PERSON>'s group for the economic development projects in <LOCATION> Camden </LOCATION> and East Orange, two <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> cities with blighted central districts. East Orange Mayor <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Hatcher </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> on Sunday that <PERSON> Singletary </PERSON> proposed a commercial project in two abandoned buildings in the city's Ampere section. `` And as far as I understand, they were pretty well set with the project as far as plans were concerned,'' <PERSON> Hatcher </PERSON> said. But the proposal never went beyond the discussions, he said. <PERSON> Hatcher </PERSON> said most discussions with <PERSON> Singletary </PERSON> and his firm would have been by city planners and that he did n't `` get involved in technical details or get into a big dissertation with them.'' Camden Mayor <PERSON> Melvin </PERSON> `` <PERSON> Randy </PERSON><PERSON> '' </PERSON> <PERSON> Primas </PERSON> also said he did n't remember the details but added, `` I think I remember the man, but nothing ever happened We're always getting developers in.'' <PERSON> DuBois </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gilliam </PERSON>, a former <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> aide who managed the discretionary fund programs, told the Times that <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> ordered him to give the grant to <PERSON> Singletary </PERSON> even though other <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> officials opposed the grant, arguing that <PERSON> Singletary </PERSON>'s group lacked experience. <PERSON> Gilliam </PERSON> said <PERSON> Singletary </PERSON> had repeatedly contacted <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>, who `` told me he wanted us to help <PERSON> Singletary </PERSON> get some money. He said <PERSON> Singletary </PERSON> was a good guy.'' <PERSON> Gilliam </PERSON> pleaded guilty to federal conspiracy charges involving other <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> grants and is scheduled to begin serving an 18-month sentence, the Times said. Even if the grant had been made, there was nothing improper about it, <PERSON> Plotkin </PERSON> said, since <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> had the right to use the money under <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION>'s Technical Assistance program at his discretion. The Times said <PERSON> Singletary </PERSON>'s group originally approached <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> in 1985 for nearly $ 1 million for the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> projects. A <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> official who talked to the Times on condition he not be identified said the proposal was rejected because of concern over its cost and the relative inexperience of <PERSON> Singletary </PERSON>'s group. The group scaled back the proposal, and the $ 350,000 grant was approved through <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION>'s regional office in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Tamil Rebels Kill 17 Sinhalese Soldiers, Military Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Tamil rebels ambushed an army truck and killed 17 Sinhalese soldiers Sunday in a northern district, a military official reported. He said the killers first attacked with grenades and then sprayed the truck with rifle fire, killing all the soldiers who were returning to base from a trip to market in <LOCATION> Vavunia </LOCATION> district. <LOCATION> Vavunia </LOCATION> is about 110 miles north of <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION>. The official, who was not identified in line with army regulations, blamed the attack on ethnic Tamil insurgents. In another development, a government official reported that 115 anti-government Sinhalese had surrendered to army units since Friday. He said air force helicopters had dropped 350,000 leaflets in southern, central and northern parts of <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION> appealing to Sinhalese militants to give themselves up. Sinhalese militants launched their own uprising after the government signed an Indian-sponsored peace accord in 1987 aimed at ending the Tamil insurgency. The accord offered Tamils limited autonomy if they would give up their weapons. But Sinhalese militants took up arms, saying the pact gave to many concessions to the Tamils, who have been fighting to establish their own country in northeastern <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION> since 1983. Tamils form 18 percent of <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>'s population of 16 million, and the Sinhalese make up 75 percent. The Tamils, who are generally Hindus, claim discrimination by the mostly Buddhist Sinhalese. Sinhalese militants also object to the presence of <LOCATION> Indian </LOCATION> peacekeeping forces in this island nation off <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s southern coast. The Indian troops came here as part of the 1987 agreement to help disarm the Tamil rebels, but many of the insurgents rejected the pact and battled the Indians. About 28,000 Indian soldiers remain in <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>, but <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> has said all will be withdrawn by Dec. 31. More than 11,000 people, including 1,000 Indian troopers, have been killed since 1983 in the Tamil revolt. About 5,000 were killed in the Sinhalese uprising.

<HEAD>Black `Soldiers' Re-Enact Their Civil War Role</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN STRAUSS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>FRANKLIN, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 No black soldiers fought at the Battle of <LOCATION> Franklin </LOCATION>, but 125 years later black Civil War re-enactors are reminding their fellow history buffs of the contributions African-Americans made in the war. A re-enactment of the 1864 battle Sunday capped a weekend of events to mark the 125th anniversary of the fight. In it Confederate Gen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Bell </PERSON> <PERSON> Hood </PERSON> lost more than 6,000 soldiers, crippling the South's second-biggest force, the Army of <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>. The recreation attracted an estimated 4,000 re-enactors from around the country. Similar battles will lead up to the 125th anniversary of the surrender at <LOCATION> Appomattox </LOCATION> on April 9. The recreations feature lines of `` soldiers'' firing replica weapons, booming cannon and cavalry charges. `` Casualties'' fall to the ground, though there are rules: Do n't fall with a loaded weapon or with a bayonet. In one of the few deviations allowed from the historical record, the Union forces at a field about 20 miles south of <LOCATION> Nashville </LOCATION> this weekend included about two dozen black re-enactors representing the 54th <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Volunteer Infantry. <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON> <PERSON> Urwin </PERSON>, a history professor at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arkansas </ORGANIZATION> in <PERSON> Conway </PERSON> and leader of the 54th, said about 180,000 black soldiers fought in the Civil War. They were allowed to join in 1863 after the Emancipation Proclamation and eventually made up 10 percent of the Union army. `` There was an initial reluctance, a fear of a backlash, that white Northerners would fight to preserve the union but not to end slavery,'' said <PERSON> Urwin </PERSON>. `` And there was a fear that Southerners would fight twice as hard if blacks were armed against them.'' Black soldiers served with distinction in the Battle of <LOCATION> Nashville </LOCATION>, where they helped lead one of the attacks that allowed Union troops to turn the Confederates back. They were also active in the siege of <LOCATION> Petersburg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, and several divisions were among the Union units that helped stop Gen. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>'s retreat at <LOCATION> Appomattox </LOCATION>. `` The first black units that were raised performed well in combat. And by that point in the war, heavy losses and frequent defeats made more Northerners willing to accept any kind of extra manpower,'' <PERSON> Urwin </PERSON> said. Black participation in the war was used to justify the passage of the 14th Amendment, making them citizens, and the 15th, which gave them the right to vote. `` Without those Constitutional weapons there would have been no civil rights movement in our own time,'' said <PERSON> Urwin </PERSON>. `` So, in a sense, the black troops of the Civil War were the pioneers in the revolution in race relations that we've lived through the past 25 or 30 years.'' <PERSON> Urwin </PERSON> said the Franklin recreation is a good chance for his group to remind history buffs of the contribution of black soldiers. `` It's a chance, finally, 125 years after, for black and white Americans to get together and celebrate their common heritage of valor.'' The re-enactors have a passion for accuracy in their portrayals, wearing authentic wool uniforms and camping out without sleeping bags, as did soldiers of the period. <PERSON> Urwin </PERSON>, 34, had no ancestors in the war but has an interest that goes beyond the scholarship of his military history interest. `` I get the chill like everybody else,'' he said. `` There are certain moments, like when twilight is falling over the camp and the spectators have departed. `` You look and all you see is the 19th century: sentinels are marching their beats, people are beginning to light their campfires. That's one moment when you can almost fool yourself into thinking that you're back in time.''

<HEAD>Heavy Snow Continues In Northeast</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 Up to 18 inches of snow fell Sunday over parts of the <LOCATION> Northeast </LOCATION>, and cold air covered much of the nation east of the <ORGANIZATION> Rockies </ORGANIZATION> with highs only in the teens from <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> to northern <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>. A storm centered off the coast of <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> dumped heavy snow over much of the state, and high wind in the wake of the storm produced squalls with heavy snow in the <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lakes </LOCATION> region. Southern and central <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> got 6 to 14 inches of snow from late Saturday into Sunday, while snow squalls in the lower <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lakes </LOCATION> region buried parts of western <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> state </LOCATION>, with up to 18 inches at <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>, south-southeast of <LOCATION> Buffalo </LOCATION>. Up to 8 inches of snow blanketed <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION> from Saturday into Sunday, and totals along the northern and western lake shores of <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> ranged up to 13 inches. In northern <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, up to 13 inches fell at <LOCATION> Michiana </LOCATION> and up to a foot fell along the <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Erie </LOCATION> shore in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>. Strong, gusty wind accompanied the snow in the <LOCATION> Northeast </LOCATION>, causing considerable blowing and drifting of snow and producing wind chill readings well below zero. During the late morning, wind gusts reaching 60 mph were reported at <LOCATION> Johnstown </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>. Low temperatures early Sunday dipped into the teens and single digits from the northern and central High Plains through the <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> and the Great Lakes to northern <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, with subzero readings in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> Afternoon temperatures were generally below freezing from the Dakotas and the lower <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> to the middle and northern <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION>, with readings mostly in the teens from <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> through the Great Lakes region to northern <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>. But strong wind blowing down the eastern slopes of the <ORGANIZATION> Rockies </ORGANIZATION> brought mild temperatures to the <LOCATION> High </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plains </LOCATION> region with afternoon readings in the 40s and 50s as far north as <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>. The cold air was heading south with the coldest air so far this season expected in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> on Monday. Lows Monday should range from the mid 20s in the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Panhandle </LOCATION> to the mid to upper 40s in the Keys, forecast the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Coral </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gables </LOCATION>. Elsewhere, a cold front produced showers over the northern <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION>, with less than an inch of rain during the six hours up to 1 p.m. EST. Showers brought locally heavy rain to the lower <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Grande </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> late Saturday and early Sunday. <PERSON> Alice </PERSON>, west of <LOCATION> Corpus </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Christi </LOCATION>, got 1.52 inches in the 24 hours up to 7 a.m. EST.

 It took a lot of pull to become the first female motorcycle police officer in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>. In fact, D.K. <PERSON> Lowe </PERSON> had to pull up all 750 pounds of her department-issued <LOCATION> Kawasaki </LOCATION> 1000 many times a day. The exercise is required of all <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> motorcycle officers. The 37-year-old policewoman, who stands 5-foot-4, said recently that there were many times, especially toward the end of the day, that the motorcycle seemed to weigh a ton and she wondered, `` What am I doing here?'' But she managed to pull up her bike each and every time during her six weeks of training. Last week, she won the shoulder patch with wings designating her a motorcycle officer. She'll have to wait a bit for her boots, however. Ms. <PERSON> Lowe </PERSON> was issued a pair of size-7, knee-high boots in black leather, the smallest in stock, and has had to wear three pairs of socks to make them fit. Now that she's passed her training, the department has ordered new boots. `` I'm lucky,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Lowe </PERSON>. `` The balls of my feet do touch the ground. Well, at least one of them.'' Despite motorcycle officers' tough image, Ms. <PERSON> Lowe </PERSON> said she plans to add a dash of femininity. `` My motto is: I do n't put that helmet on without putting my lipstick on,'' she said.

 <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> McLynn </PERSON> has the perfect Christmas gift suggestion for the person who has everything, including a car that works: a Batmobile that does n't.

The deadline: Dec. 20. `` My accountant thinks it's going to be more lucrative if we try for somebody in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>,'' he said. `` Somebody who's going to want to sit on this thing for an investment or just for laughs and has that kind of money ...''

 Things seemed amiss at the Eastern Cemetery for years. There were complaints about poor upkeep. A stray human bone was found in 1986. There was a lawsuit when a newly purchased grave was found to be occupied. But only when a gravedigger tipped <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Caldwell </PERSON>, an investigator for the state attorney general, last spring did the astounding details begin to emerge. Authorities say as many as 48,000 people were buried in already occupied graves in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cemetery </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Greenwood </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cemetery </LOCATION>. Both cemeteries, on <LOCATION> Louisville </LOCATION>'s east side, are owned by the <ORGANIZATION> Louisville </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Crematory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Cemeteries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Caldwell </PERSON> reported finding dozens of infants buried too shallow, some as little as 10 inches below the surface, at <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cemetery </ORGANIZATION>, and remains of more than 200 cremated bodies, many unidentified, shelved in the cellar of the crematory For an undetermined number of people, their `` final resting place'' was neither final nor restful. A 60-count indictment issued in July alleges that some remains were unearthed so that the graves could be reused; the remains were then scattered throughout the grounds, mixed into other graves or put in a storage building. The attorney general obtained the indictment and filed a lawsuit against the 145-year-old company and three former officers _ <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, who was its executive director; <PERSON> Clifford </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Amos </PERSON>, who was company president, and <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Copley </PERSON>, who was vice president. All three men have resigned and pleaded innocent. The cemetery company's spokesman, <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Kinman </PERSON>, did not immediately return a message Sunday. In the past, the company's lawyers have said they do n't want to comment on pending litigation Criminal charges included corpse abuse, grave desecration, theft, improper handling of burial payments and failure to keep adequate funds in perpetual-care and maintenance trust accounts. The theft charge referred to the money received for care of the plots the company allegedly failed to provide. The civil suit alleged numerous violations of the <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> Consumer Protection Act, including reuse of previously sold or occupied graves, sales of services never provided, failure to maintain graves and failure to dispose of cremated remains. Trial on the criminal charges is scheduled in February. No date has been set for a trial on the lawsuit. <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> was hired in 1986 and <LOCATION> Copley </LOCATION> began work in 1987. <PERSON> Amos </PERSON> was acting executive director from 1980 to 1986, then became president. The alleged wrongdoings at Eastern and <PERSON> Greenwood </PERSON> began long before they joined the company. Graves were reused on such a scale that `` it would almost have to be a matter of policy'' by the company, said <PERSON> Phillip </PERSON> <PERSON> DiBlasi </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Louisville </ORGANIZATION> archaeologist who supervised excavations at the cemeteries under a court order. `` It seemed to become a relatively common practice around the early part of the century,'' <PERSON> DiBlasi </PERSON> said. `` Why it continued until the whistle was blown, I do n't know.'' Records indicate Eastern Cemetery probably was full shortly after the turn of the century. It had enough room for about 18,000 bodies under current industry standards, but 51,000 may have been buried there, according to <PERSON> DiBlasi </PERSON> and <PERSON> Caldwell </PERSON>. <PERSON> Caldwell </PERSON>'s report also estimated that 15,000 bodies too many were buried at <LOCATION> Greenwood </LOCATION>. The cemetery company came under scrutiny in May, when <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON>, a gravedigger and maintenance worker for eight years, called the attorney general's office to report the alleged burial practices, <PERSON> Caldwell </PERSON> said. During the investigation, <PERSON> Caldwell </PERSON> found bones stored throughout <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cemetery </LOCATION> _ in a truck's glove compartment, in a tool box, in a storage shed, in dirt piles and even in a fast food hamburger bag, his report said. <PERSON> DiBlasi </PERSON> said he had uncovered a number of old headstones or headstone fragments in Eastern, some of which appeared to have been deliberately buried. Graves that were dug up for reuse typically were very old, unlikely to be missed by anyone today, <PERSON> DiBlasi </PERSON> said. Also, `` these were real poor people,'' he said. `` They're also in wooden containers, which is real easy to dig through.''

 Weather-weary network crews packed their gear and left <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION> on Sunday after storms there caused hasty changes and technical problems in their coverage of the summit meeting. CBS and <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> coverage Saturday of the meeting between President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> was n't much affected, despite heavy wind and stormy seas that ended plans for afternoon and dinner meetings that day. But the day's 60 mph wind destroyed a studio set <ORGANIZATION> CNN </ORGANIZATION> had built near <LOCATION> Marsaxlokk </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>, overlooking the harbor site of the shipboard summit, and also blew down and damaged a <ORGANIZATION> CNN </ORGANIZATION> satellite dish. That knocked out <ORGANIZATION> CNN </ORGANIZATION>'s TV signal for eight hours, starting at 9 p.m. EST, although a network spokesman in <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION> said most of the TV blackout occurred when little was going on and no transmissions were planned. Saturday's storm also affected <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>, but only briefly. Rain shorted out an electrical connection right at the start of <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> anchorman <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Jenning </PERSON>'s live summit report from <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION> during the first of two `` World News Tonight'' broadcasts that <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> sends its affiliates each night. The broadcast was hurriedly reshaped in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> while still on the air. Anchorwoman <PERSON> Carole </PERSON> <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON> reported other news while the <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION> connection was restored, and <PERSON> Jennings </PERSON> came back on with his report eight minutes later. The four networks' anchormen all were in <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION>. But only <PERSON> Jennings </PERSON> was heading to <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION> on Sunday to report Monday night on <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s post-summit briefing to <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> leaders. CBS' <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Rather </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Brokaw </PERSON> were reported returning to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> CNN </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Shaw </PERSON> was en route to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> Before Saturday's storm, the networks had planned to transmit live TV pictures by microwave from the planned sites of the summit _ two guided missile cruisers, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Belknap </PERSON> and the Soviet navy's <PERSON> Slava </PERSON>. But when the storm forced the summit site changed to the safely docked Soviet luxury ship <PERSON> Maxim </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorky </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>, running the TV pool for the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> networks, had to scramble to install a microwave linkup to the Gorky. `` They -LRB- the Soviets -RRB- invited the pool to put a microwave aboard. ... We had to rip things apart to do that,'' <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> DeCesare </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION>' director of news coverage, said Saturday night from <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION>. `` It took all day to do it.'' But just as technicans had things working, he said, Saturday's planned second meeting between <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> was called off The leaders' Sunday news conference on the <PERSON> Gorky </PERSON> was televised live, with the Soviets providing both the TV pool feed for broadcasters and an audio channel offering a simultaneous English translations of <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s remarks. But broadcast woes continued. During the session's last half hour, an electronic glitch knocked out the English-language audio channel. CBS and <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> continued with their own backup Russian-speaking translators. <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> hastily brought in a Soviet official on <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION> to help, but missed eight minutes of translation. <ORGANIZATION> CNN </ORGANIZATION> went the long way for help _ to <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>. After 13 minutes in which <PERSON> Shaw </PERSON> recapped summit news while <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> was speaking, an <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> woman's voice was heard translating the Soviet leader's comments The woman was <PERSON> Siobahn </PERSON> <PERSON> Darrow </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> CNN </ORGANIZATION> staff member.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Voice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government's broadcast service overseas, will open an office in <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> that will expand its operations in the Eastern bloc to two cities, officials said Sunday <ORGANIZATION> VOA </ORGANIZATION> Deputy Director <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Coonrod </PERSON> said the office in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> is the result of `` the openness of the situation there in general and also because for our audience the story there is very important.'' The formal announcement will be made in <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> on Monday by <ORGANIZATION> VOA </ORGANIZATION> Director <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> VOA </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Beth </PERSON> <PERSON> Knisley </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> VOA </ORGANIZATION> also is broadcasting a program simultaneously with Polish state radio on Monday in which callers in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> will be able to speak with economic commentators in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> about <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Agriculture Secretary <PERSON> Clayton </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON>'s trade mission last week to <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Coonrod </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> VOA </ORGANIZATION>, which broadcasts in many languages into Eastern bloc countries, for years was jammed and vilified by the Kremlin. <ORGANIZATION> VOA </ORGANIZATION> opened its first bureau in a communist state last year in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Coonrod </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> office will not be a full bureau and no full-time correspondent will be assigned there. `` It's not a full-fledged bureau in part because we do n't have the ability at this point to staff it,'' he said. `` We will have assigned there temporarily people who speak English or Polish.'' The Communist Party-led government in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> had long required <ORGANIZATION> Voice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> workers to apply for a new visa each time the broadcast agency wanted to cover a story, said <PERSON> Coonrod </PERSON>. Government clearance for the new office was allowed when <ORGANIZATION> VOA </ORGANIZATION> officials were told they would be granted multiple-entry visas, allowing quick movement into the country.

 Leaders of the <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> military gathered Sunday in anticipation of a first-hand report from President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on his <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> summit with Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> arrived at <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION> airport at the dinner hour, where he was met by Prime Minister <PERSON> Wilfried </PERSON> <PERSON> Martens </PERSON>. During airport remarks, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` It's an exciting time for the alliance, for <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, and for <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. ... Tonight we stand at the crossroads of history on a way to <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, whole and free. ... That simple truth is manifested in the thunderous events taking place as few hundred kilometers to the east. And that simple truth brought <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and me together in a windswept harbor off <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had dinner here with West German Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> at Chateau Stuyvenberg, the 18th century guest house where the president is staying. Asked by reporters if he and <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> saw eye-to-eye on the issue of German reunification, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> declined to answer, citing his policy of refusing to accept questions at photo opportunities. <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> said the summit had continued the progress toward better East-West relations. `` I think we came forward a great deal on questions that are elementary to us,'' he said. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>, nursing a bad cold, arrived Sunday evening. British officials said she would not comment on the Bush-Gorbachev summit until after the American president had given his briefing. `` Everything that we've heard does suggests that this was entirely in line with all of the discussions before the summit between the prime minister and President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>,'' said one official, speaking on condition of anonymity. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had met with Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> on Nov. 24 at Camp David, Md. The official said that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> `` clearly got on very well together. That's of very considerable satisfaction to -LRB- Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> -RRB-. We've very pleased about it.'' The leaders of the 16-nation <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> anxiously awaiteded Monday's mini-summit to learn, and leaders were arriving throughout the day here. The <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> leaders' talks at alliance headquarters were expected to last until late afternoon Monday, when <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was due to fly back to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The officials last met in May at a summit marking the alliance's 40th anniversary The atmosphere among the allies was dramatically different from last spring when the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> were quarreling with <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> over plans for upgrading short-range nuclear missiles in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. The allies' attention will be focused this time on the momentous political and economic changes unfolding in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. The recent upheavals in the hardline regimes of <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Czechoslavakia </LOCATION>, combined with the earlier changes in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, have reduced the military threat to the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> is increasingly under pressure to reassess its role in an era of dramatically reduced tensions. The leaders' talks could well touch on the alliance's future strategy. In addition to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s briefing, the officials were to hear from <LOCATION> Italian </LOCATION> Prime Minister <PERSON> Giulio </PERSON> <PERSON> Andreotti </PERSON> about <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s trip to his country shortly before the <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION> summit. And West German Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> was likely to give his assessment of events in neighboring <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said Sunday that change in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> is `` a problem whose time has come'' and that new approaches were needed. But in a joint news conference with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> at the conclusion of the <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION> talks, the Soviet leader said `` history has willed''' that there are two Germanys. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> warned against anyone trying to make `` artificial'' changes, apparently referring to calls for unification of East and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he made clear to <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> does n't want to do anything `` unrealistic'' about East and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> that `` causes any country to end up going backwards, or end up having its own people in military conflict, one with the other.'' He said this was why he was acting cautiously, `` not to go demonstrating on top of the <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> Wall to show how happy we are about the change.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said it was n't up to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> `` to dictate the rapidity of change in any country. It's a matter for the people to determine themselves.'' `` We think that there is an understanding today in the minds of all,'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said. `` We do n't want to do anything to accelerate these changes artificially for the peoples of these two great German states.''

 President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> told his countrymen in a broadcast Monday he was impressed by President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s realism at the superpower summit and that the meetings had given a boost to work on major arms control accords. Soviet television broadcast a 25-minute interview with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> early Monday after showing the full one-hour news conference that <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> gave in <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION> after finishing their two days of talks. `` I must say I'm glad I found a lot of realism in <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s attitude and I felt his desire, his effort to understand the processes under way, exchange opinions, to work out approaches,'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said `` The dialogue actually surpassed my expectations.'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> left the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> island of <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION> after the news conference and television interview to return to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, where he will brief members of the <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pact </ORGANIZATION> military alliance on the summit talks. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> flew to <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>, to inform other leaders of the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> about the summit. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, speaking to the television interviewer in <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION>, said there were no firm results from the summit, but he and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> formed a basis for wide-ranging agreements on strategic nuclear weapons, chemical arms, and conventional forces in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> as well as economic cooperation. U.S.-Soviet relations will become `` more dynamic in all areas,'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said. He added the meeting gave a `` serious impulse'' to talks on strategic nuclear weapons and expressed the hope that the two sides could work out remaining differences so the two presidents can sign an agreement when <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> visits the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in June. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said an agreement to cut strategic nuclear weapons, which the superpowers have been negotiating for years, would be an `` epochal'' treaty far outstripping in importance the 1987 agreement to scrap medium-range weapons. He said a conventional arms agreement in the <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> negotiations is possible next year, and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> found `` new, very important'' elements in <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s approach to a ban on chemical weapons. He did not elaborate. `` This meeting created good preconditions for reaching concrete results,'' the Soviet leader said. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> told the interviewer <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had shown for the first time interest in economic cooperation with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. He said Soviet officials watched carefully while <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and his advisers formed their policies toward the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> after last year's election. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has now made a choice for broad cooperation with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said. `` I am under the impression that it is not just a tactical move. I welcome it.'' `` I am satisfied with the personal ties we established,'' he said.

<TEXT>
 A team of Israeli doctors on Sunday unveiled a laser scanner that they said can detect certain types of cancer by examining a blood sample, eliminating the need for surgical tests. Doctors at <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Ichilov </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>, who began testing the device about two weeks ago, said the Cytoscan machine is still in an experimental stage and has an error rate of almost 5 percent. But they said the device, which needs only a syringe of blood for analysis, could become part of routine testing for the detection of early signs of cancer. `` It's a great breakthrough that shows promise,'' Dr. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Michaeli </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Tel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviv </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> that includes Ichilov, told reporters. Dr. <PERSON> Samarrio </PERSON> <PERSON> Chaitchik </PERSON>, head of Ichilov's oncology department, said the Cytoscan could become as common `` as a microscope in several years.'' He added the machine still needs to be made more accurate and quicker. <PERSON> Chaitchik </PERSON> said the Cytoscan is `` too hazardous to use for general screening'' because of its error rate and he only uses the machine to test recovering cancer patients who are under observation for recurrences of the disease. `` Maybe in the future when we feel more confident we will use it for screening. But this is still far-fetched,'' <PERSON> Michaeli </PERSON> said. `` I do n't want the public going crazy lining up outside waiting to have their blood tested.'' He said researchers estimate that improved Cytoscan models would be able to test up to 120 blood samples in one hour, but the machine now used at Ichilov takes four to six hours to scan six samples. Doctors at Ichilov have tested 700 post-surgery cancer patients with the Cytoscan, which has shown a 95-percent success rate, according to <PERSON> Michaeli </PERSON>. An additional 300 student volunteers were tested at <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Bar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ilan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, where the machine was developed, and one error was reported Researchers at <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Hadassah </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> said results of the Cytoscan's preliminary tests were not published in medical journals, but the tests were based on well-known technologies and showed a significant advancement in cancer research. Doctors using normal procedures to test for cancer take a tissue sample, called a biopsy, which is then tested by pathologists. <PERSON> Arye </PERSON> <PERSON> Weinreb </PERSON>, director of the reseach team that developed the Cytoscan, said testing with the device is far simpler and involves no surgery. He said a small blood sample is taken from a patient and the lymphocytes, a type of white blood cell that helps fight disease, are separated and placed in the Cytoscan. The cells are dyed and bombarded with polarized light from a laser. The Cytoscan's computers track and measure the individual reactions of thousands of different lymphocites that reveal if the cells have been affected by cancer. <PERSON> Weinreb </PERSON> said the device has successfully detected cancer of the breast, colon and lung cancer, but was not able to detect leukemia. <PERSON> Zvi </PERSON> <PERSON> Rechavi </PERSON>, the director of <PERSON> Tamam </PERSON>, a division of <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aircraft </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION>, which produces the $ 175,000 Cytoscans, said two machines are currently in operation at Ichilov and Bar Ilan. He said there are plans to produce an improved model by January 1992. `` The new machines will be fully automatic and sterile,'' <PERSON> Rechavi </PERSON> said. `` From the introduction of the sample into the machine to the end of the test, the sample will not have had to be handled.'' <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aircraft </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> director <PERSON> Mordechai </PERSON> <PERSON> Hod </PERSON> said the company is looking for a partner in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for joint production. He said the Cytoscan was a spinoff from military research in laser technology and reflected an effort by the company to get involved in civilian production.

 Soldiers fatally shot a 10-year-old Palestinian girl in the head Sunday and reportedly wounded at least 27 other Arabs during widespread clashes triggered by mass arrests in the occupied lands. The army confirmed one injury and the girl's death in the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> and said it was investigating the circumstances. Two other Palestinians died in explosions in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, including a 12-year-old boy who picked up an unidentified object that blew up, the army said. Also Sunday, two newspapers said the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> had approved of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> peace proposals after receiving American assurances it can play a behind-the-scenes role in negotiations. The upsurge in violence came as PLO-backed leaders of the Palestinian uprising called for a `` higher stage of struggle'' against <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to mark the second anniversary this week of the rebellion. Since the start of the revolt Dec. 9, 1987, 624 Arabs have been killed by Israelis. Another 154 have been slain by fellow Arabs who accused them of collaborating with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. Forty-two Israelis have been killed. In the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> city of <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION>, hundreds of soldiers carried out a massive search for uprising activists for a third day after detaining suspects and killing four others Friday and Saturday. <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> quoted high-ranking military officials as saying more than 70 were arrested in <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION>. Earlier, army officials had put the number at more than 30 in an interview with The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. Israeli media said the sweep was the army's largest since <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> captured the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> in the 1967 Middle East War. The daily <ORGANIZATION> Maariv </ORGANIZATION> said about 2,000 soldiers were searching <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION>, which has a population of more than 100,000 and has been a major center of the uprising. Palestinians responded to the sweep by staging a general strike Sunday throughout the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> and Arab east <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>. Dozens of youths burned tires and hurled rocks and bottles in refugee camps, towns and neighborhoods in the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> reports said. Troops responded with tear gas, rubber bullets and live ammunition. In the Shati refugee camp, 10-year-old <PERSON> Sabah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ahmad </PERSON> <PERSON> Balousha </PERSON> was struck by a bullet in the right eye and died, the reports said. Nine other people were wounded at the camp, including a 4-year-old boy struck in the head by a rubber bullet, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> reports said. Among the other wounded was a 9-year-old boy struck in the arm by live ammunition in <LOCATION> Beit </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hanoun </LOCATION> village in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>, hospital officials said. The army confirmed the shooting of a masked protester in the <LOCATION> Jebaliya </LOCATION> refugee camp. Arab reports said eight people were wounded in <LOCATION> Jebaliya </LOCATION>. Other gunshot injuries were reported in the Bureij and Nusseirat refugee camps and the <LOCATION> Zeitoun </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Sheikh </PERSON> <PERSON> Radwan </PERSON> and Rimal areas in and around <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. In their 49th leaflet, the uprising leaders urged <LOCATION> Palestinians </LOCATION> to step up the rebellion and noted that it had led to American dialogue with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> and led <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to come up with a <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> peace plan. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> has proposed holding elections in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> as part of an interim solution for limited autonomy for the 1.7 million Palestinians in the territories. Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> issued a five-point proposal in support of an Egyptian call for preliminary talks between Israelis and Palestinians, and <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> approved of it after assurances the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> would be left out of the negotiations. The Jerusalem Post and <ORGANIZATION> Haaretz </ORGANIZATION> newspapers Sunday said that despite the Israeli conditions, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> had assured the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> it can have a behind-the-scenes role. The <ORGANIZATION> Haaretz </ORGANIZATION> said Foreign Minister <PERSON> Moshe </PERSON> <PERSON> Arens </PERSON> protested news of the reported <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> guarantees and alleged that <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> was being drawn into indirect talks with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> against its wishes.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> have signed a $ 30 million agriculture accord that may eventually lead to a major new market for Israeli farmers, the government said Sunday. Agriculture Minister <PERSON> Avraham </PERSON> <PERSON> Katz-Oz </PERSON> announced the deal when he returned from a six-day visit to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, the first such trip by an Israeli minister in at least 22 years. He was invited by the <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION>. `` I have got my shoes in the door, and now it is going to remain open,'' he told reporters at the <LOCATION> Ben-Gurion </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> near <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION>. Katz-Oz, of the center-left <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, said he met with members of the Supreme Soviet legislature and officials from the <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION>. `` The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> is not concealing this visit; it wants that to be clear. But I do n't want to call it a diplomatic breakthrough. I'm not working at the foreign ministry,'' Katz-Oz said. The two sides signed a $ 30 million agreement allowing export of 90,000 tons of fresh fruits and vegetables `` starting with potatoes and ending with strawberries,'' to the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> region, <PERSON> Katz-Oz </PERSON> said. He said the agreement was a barter deal in which a third party would sell Soviet goods for hard currency and transfer it to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. `` What's happening is that they have a whole list of products they want to export, but we do n't need many of these products,'' he said. The Israeli agricultural products would be transferred by Soviet cargo planes from the Ben-Gurion airport or by Soviet ships from the southern port of <LOCATION> Ashdod </LOCATION> to the port of <LOCATION> Odessa </LOCATION> on the <LOCATION> Black </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION>, and then by railroad to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Katz-Oz </PERSON> said. Asked by <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION> when the arrangement would begin, he said that `` if the Soviets fulfill their promise and the first Soviet plane would land here on Dec. 23, then on Dec. 25 the products will be there.'' He said the agreement with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> did not change much for <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> agriculture at present. However, it may eventually be expanded to `` millions tons a year ... and then we will have to plan, to make another program for the <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> agriculture.'' <PERSON> Katz-Oz </PERSON> said he also signed an agreement on youth exchanges that would encompass about 1,000 youths ages 15 to 17 from both countries. The first to come would be a group of 50 Soviet children who have suffered radiation effects during the world's worst nuclear accident at the <LOCATION> Chernobyl </LOCATION> nuclear reactor in April 1986. They will undergo medical tests and spend two weeks in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s kibbutzim, or collective settlements. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> cut diplomatic ties with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> following the 1967 <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> war. The two countries exchanged low-level diplomatic missions in 1987 and 1988 and are now developing cultural and economic ties.

<TEXT>
 About 500 people gathered at a church in this <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> suburb to remember four construction workers who died in the collapse last week of a giant crane in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. The four employees of Kirkland-based <ORGANIZATION> Erection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> were hard workers who cared deeply about their work and families, friends, relatives and co-workers said at the joint memorial service Saturday at <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Anthony </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>. Ironworker <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Graden </PERSON>, 34, of <LOCATION> Kirkland </LOCATION> always seemed to be smiling said a friend, <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Whittaker </PERSON>. `` He would n't want to see anybody grieving over his death,'' <PERSON> Whittaker </PERSON> said. Crane operator <PERSON> Lonnie </PERSON> <PERSON> Boggess </PERSON>, 45, of <LOCATION> Tacoma </LOCATION>, and ironworkers <PERSON> Graden </PERSON>; <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Cline </PERSON>, 49, of the <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> area; and <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Tilton </PERSON>, 35, of <LOCATION> Spanaway </LOCATION> were killed when the crane plummeted 16 stories in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>'s Financial District. A school bus driver also died and 21 people were injured. The investigation into the accident has focused on the possibility of human error. <PERSON> Boggess </PERSON>, who had lost a bitter custody battle with his ex-wife and admitted severe personal problems, including alcohol abuse, were affecting his work, was recalled by a friend, <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Jensen </PERSON>, as honest and generous. `` He gave freely of himself, his time, his energy and his knowledge freely,'' <PERSON> Jensen </PERSON> said. A friend and co-worker of <PERSON> Cline </PERSON>, <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> <PERSON> Glockner </PERSON>, said <PERSON> Cline </PERSON> taught two of his sons the construction trade and `` was always the first to dig into his wallet when someone came around collecting for an injured ironworker.'' <PERSON> Tilton </PERSON> had `` a loving, strong, healthy, old-fashioned pride'' in his country, labor union, children and marriage, said a message from his widow, <PERSON> Terry </PERSON>, that was read by <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> McLaughlin </PERSON>. <PERSON> McLaughlin </PERSON> is the director of a <LOCATION> Tacoma </LOCATION> organization for victims called Crisis Care Services. <PERSON> Tilton </PERSON> was buried Saturday afternoon before the memorial service.

<TEXT>
 Communist leaders named a new government Sunday that includes non-Communists for the first time in 21 years, but it was immediately denounced because of the large number of holdovers from the last Cabinet. Premier <PERSON> Ladislav </PERSON> <PERSON> Adamec </PERSON> said the government is open to `` radical changes,'' but opposition leaders called for a renewal of mass street protests and threatened a general strike if the ministers are not replaced in a week. Hundreds of people gathered on <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Wenceslas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION> in the night and urged people to rally Monday, chanting `` Everybody here tomorrow!'' The new government includes five non-Communists, but the other 16 members are Communists, and 13 served on the previous Cabinet. It failed to meet opposition demands for a non-Communist interior minister, who is in charge of police, and a civilian defense minister. As he swore in the Cabinet, President <PERSON> Gustav </PERSON> <PERSON> Husak </PERSON> indicated he may be ready to stop down, as the opposition has demanded. <PERSON> Husak </PERSON> was installed here after the crushing of reforms in 1968, and he is the last of those leaders still in power. One of the government's first acts was to propose talks with <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> on the future of the 80,000 Soviet troops in <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> since the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact invasion that crushed the reforms 21 years ago. Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, the architect of the reforms sweeping <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, recently criticized the invasion. The Cabinet holdovers include Foreign Minister <PERSON> Jaromir </PERSON> <PERSON> Johanes </PERSON>, criticized for defending past harsh stands on human rights, and <PERSON> Antonin </PERSON> <PERSON> Krumnikl </PERSON>, whose energy policies have been blamed for serious pollution problems. The Civic Forum opposition group demanded their ouster. First Deputy Premier <PERSON> Bohumil </PERSON> <PERSON> Urban </PERSON>, announcing the appointments at a news conference, said it was not possible to meet every demand. `` But this is what life is like. You ca n't take into account everybody's demands immediately,'' he said. Striking students, whose protests of police brutality at a Nov. 17 demonstration sparked <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>'s peaceful revolt, laughed in derision at their headquarters as they listened to the news on the radio. The state-run news agency <ORGANIZATION> CTK </ORGANIZATION> reported that students decided they would not return to class Monday as previously planned. The new government seemed a clear attempt by the Communists to buy time to get reform going at a pace they dictate, rather than at the rushed tempo forced by the protests of the past two weeks. The biggest protest occurred one week ago, when millions of people observed calls for a two-hour general strike. After the strike, <PERSON> Adamec </PERSON> agreed to Civic Forum demands for a new government that would include non-Communists. Strike committees have been on alert since last week's protest, and workers said Sunday they were ready to leave their jobs again. `` It's the only way for citizens to show what they want,'' said <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, a worker at <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> CKD </ORGANIZATION> heavy equipment manufacturing complex. He threatened a strike Dec. 11 if a new government is not in place in a week. <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> also demanded free elections by July. Urban said Sunday the government and local administrations would continue to be reshuffled and said new officials could be appointed `` regardless of political affiliation.'' `` You must understand this as the start of a process,'' he stressed. <PERSON> Jiri </PERSON> <PERSON> Dienstbier </PERSON>, spokesman for the Civic Forum movement, said his group was calling another mass rally Monday at <LOCATION> Wenceslas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION>, the focal point of the protests that toppled long-time leader <PERSON> Milos </PERSON> <PERSON> Jakes </PERSON> and ended the Communists' 41-year monopoly on power. The opposition also seeks new laws that would anchor the democratic rights of assembly and free press and pave the way for free elections. At its first meeting, the new government condemned the Soviet-led <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact invasion of 1968, which crushed a reform movement. It appointed Foreign Minister <PERSON> Johanes </PERSON> to negotiate with <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> on the future of the estimated 80,000 Soviet troops stationed in <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> ever since. The move was clearly intended to try to win sympathy for the government from a population that was horrified by the invasion and despised the leaders installed by <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> afterward. All except <PERSON> Husak </PERSON> have since been toppled. `` I do n't have any ambitions to remain in my function,'' <ORGANIZATION> CTK </ORGANIZATION> quoted <PERSON> Husak </PERSON> as saying as he installed the new leaders. He said his future would have to be discussed by all political parties and opposition groups before he made any decision. The five non-Communist ministers in the new Cabinet include three people without party affiliation and one man each from the Socialist and People's parties. Those parties have traditionally been docile allies of the Communists but have become more independent in recent months as reforms sweep other East bloc countries. The most interesting new appointment was that of non-party man <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> Hromadka </PERSON>, a high-ranking leader of <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>, known as <PERSON> Czech </PERSON> <PERSON> Brethren </PERSON>, who became one of seven deputy premiers Deputy Defense Minister Col.-Gen. <PERSON> Miroslav </PERSON> <PERSON> Vacek </PERSON> moved up to take over defense, and <PERSON> Frantisek </PERSON> <PERSON> Pinc </PERSON>, a politically unknown Communist who last served as director of a nuclear power station, got the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> On Sunday, the heads of <ORGANIZATION> CTK </ORGANIZATION> and state radio lost their jobs, according to <ORGANIZATION> CTK </ORGANIZATION>, as part of the wholesale reshuffling of posts now going on. Premier <PERSON> Adamec </PERSON>, Foreign Minister <PERSON> Johanes </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Karel </PERSON> <PERSON> Urbanek </PERSON> and Politburo member <PERSON> Ondrej </PERSON> <PERSON> Saling </PERSON> left later Sunday for <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, where <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pact </ORGANIZATION> leaders were meeting following the superpower summit in <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION>.

 Czechoslovaks on Monday celebrated their first unrestricted travel in decades, with carloads crossing into the West minutes after the borders were opened. `` This is an indescribable feeling,'' said <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Spurny </PERSON>, 25, as he and his brother, <PERSON> Dusan </PERSON>, drove their yellow <ORGANIZATION> Wartburg </ORGANIZATION> sedan onto Austrian territory. They were greeted by television lights and a small crowd of well-wishers with a sign reading `` Welcome to <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>.'' Minutes before, Austrian and Czechoslovak border guards shook hands on the dividing line in a manifestation of friendship. The new open-border policy went into effect at midnight Sunday. More than 100 cars had lined up at the <LOCATION> Bratislava-Berg </LOCATION> crossing when the barrier was lifted four minutes past midnight. However, relatively light traffic was reported at some of about 20 road and rail crossings linking <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> with <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. The Communist government announced Thursday that all obstacles to travel to the West would be removed. It was among the concessions granted after weeks of pro-democracy demonstrations by hundreds of thousands of people. The move came after the East German government, spurred by similar mass protests, announced last month it was opening its Western borders, including the <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> Wall. In this country, travel regulations introduced in 1987 had made visits to the West easier for Czechoslovaks than for most citizens of other Soviet-bloc countries, but there were still formidable bureaucratic obstacles. Before the borders opened Monday, those seeking to go West needed a passport. They also needed authorization from the police, from their workplace or school and in some cases from local <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> officials to get an exit visa. They also had to have invitations from relatives or friends in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION>. Now they need only to show their passports and fill out a brief questionnaire giving their names, addresses, the country they will visit and the duration of their stay. Only one Czechoslovak soldier was on duty at the <LOCATION> Bratislava-Berg </LOCATION> crossing of a two-lane road when the first Austria-bound cars arrived about 10 p.m. <PERSON> Dusan </PERSON> <PERSON> Spurney </PERSON>, 22, said, `` I'm just going to drive across and then drive right back. I just want to see if it works.'' <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Spurny </PERSON> looked at the border guard, clapping his arms across his chest to ward off the winter chill, and said, `` He's still packing a sub-machine gun, but now he's not likely to have to use it.'' <PERSON> Stanislav </PERSON> <PERSON> Balaz </PERSON>, his wife and their 14-year-old daughter were heading for <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>, 42 miles away. <PERSON> Balaz </PERSON> said it was their first trip to the West since they went to <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> eight years ago. `` Maybe this is truly freedom,'' he said.

<HEAD>Woman Receives Heart-Liver-Kidney Transplant</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A 26-year-old woman underwent what doctors said was the world's first heart-liver-kidney transplant on Sunday. <PERSON> Cindy </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Archbald </LOCATION> was listed in critical condition Sunday night, considered normal after a transplant operationn, according to <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Rossi </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for <ORGANIZATION> University-Presbyterian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>. The operation began at 7:35 p.m. Saturday and ended at 5 p.m. Sunday, Ms. <PERSON> Rossi </PERSON> said. Although multi-organ transplants have been done before, this was the first involving the heart, liver and a kidney, according to transplant pioneer Dr. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Starzl </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pittsburgh </ORGANIZATION>'s transplant program. The surgery was the second heart transplant for the patient, who has familial cardiomyopathy, an inherited heart disease, hospital officials said. Since her first transplant three years ago, Ms. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> had suffered from chronic rejection of the heart and developed hepatits and kidney dysfunction. Kidney dysfunction is a side effect sometimes present in patients taking the anti-rejection drug cyclosporine. The world's first heart-liver transplant was performed on <PERSON> Stormie </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, 12, of White Settlement, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Starzl </PERSON> conducted that procedure on Feb. 14, 1984, at Children's Hospital of <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>. Two other heart-liver transplants were performed the next year in <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>, but both patients died with a few days of surgery. Multiple-organ transplants also have been performed on adults with malignant, inoperable tumors in the pancreas and liver areas. In those cases, surgeons have removed the patient's liver, pancreas, most or all of the stomach, two-thirds of the colon, and duodenum, a 10-inch-long section of the small intestine. The cavity has been filled with a block of organs consisting of the liver, pancreas, duodenum and jejunum, a few feet of section of the small intestine.

 Rebel troopers allowed 18 air force soldiers accused in the murder of President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>'s husband, <PERSON> Benigno </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>, to escape during the weekend coup attempt, an air force spokesman said Monday `` I believe some of the rebels who took over some facilities in <PERSON> Villamor </PERSON> -LRB- air base -RRB- allowed them to get out and those who wanted to get out were allowed to go,'' said Col. <PERSON> Melchor </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosales </PERSON>. Rebels seized the base when coup bid began Friday and later gave it up. <PERSON> Rosales </PERSON> said 28 of the accused were held in a special detention center inside the base. He said 18 of those were still `` unaccounted for'' Monday. The soldiers are among 37 people accused of conspiracy in the Aug. 21, 1983, assassination of former Sen. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>, who was shot as he arrived from self-imposed exile in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to lead the opposition against the late president <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>. <PERSON> Rosales </PERSON> said Maj.

 West German leaders Sunday hailed the resignation of <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s Communist leadership, with Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> calling it a `` dramatic development'' in the flood of <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc reforms. <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> spoke with reporters after a dinner meeting with President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who had just arrived in <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION> from his summit in <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION> with Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. On Monday, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is to inform other leaders of the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> about the summit talks. <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> said prospects for a closer relationship between the two Germanys was a major topic at his meeting with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. He told reporters he and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> discussed in detail <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s 10-point proposal for the eventual reunification of <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> He said he emphasized that <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> seeks progressive improvements in relations with <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and the point when two states might merge `` is completely not the issue.'' West German Foreign Minister <PERSON> Hans-Dietrich </PERSON> <PERSON> Genscher </PERSON> said of the latest upheaval in the <ORGANIZATION> East </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> German </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>: `` In the resignation of the whole leadership there has been confirmation of what people have been saying in the street for months _ that they have no faith in them.'' The entire East German party Politburo and <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, including party chief <ORGANIZATION> Egon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Krenz </ORGANIZATION>, resigned Sunday after weeks of pro-democracy protests. While <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> dined with <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>, <PERSON> Genscher </PERSON> had dinner with Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>. <PERSON> Genscher </PERSON> will go to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> on Monday afternoon to meet with Soviet Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>. <PERSON> Genscher </PERSON>, speaking with reporters, noted concern expressed in both the East and West about a unification of <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and said, `` We recognize our great responsibility for stability in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>.'' He said the West German government does not believe that events in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> are spinning out of control. `` We are not concerned about this because the opposition movement has shown itself to be very responsible,'' he said. `` When you have hundreds of thousands of demonstrators and not a single violent incident, this shows that the masses are calm and responsible and acting in the best interests of democracy.'' <PERSON> Genscher </PERSON> called the <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION> summit `` a very, very positive development'' in the effort toward <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> unity.

 The devil is alive and well, hustling suckers in a cheap bar on <LOCATION> Nashville </LOCATION>'s Music Row. But he meets his match in <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> <PERSON> Markham </PERSON>, something of a hustler himself, willing to risk everything on the throw of the dice. Their contest for <PERSON> Billy </PERSON>'s body and soul is recounted with rip-snorting, raunchy delight in `` The Devil and <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> <PERSON> Markham </PERSON>,'' one half of a hilarious double bill entitled `` Oh, Hell,'' which opened Sunday at the <ORGANIZATION> Mitzi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Newhouse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Theater </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Lincoln </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Center </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Shel </PERSON> <PERSON> Silverstein </PERSON> wrote the <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> <PERSON> Markham </PERSON> saga, and <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Mamet </PERSON> contributed the second part of the evening, called `` <PERSON> Bobby </PERSON> <PERSON> Gould </PERSON> in Hell,'' which also features a highly unusual and comic Lucifer. <PERSON> Silverstein </PERSON>'s play is a monologue, a tall tale told in verse by actor <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Locorriere </PERSON>, a one-time member of the rock group Dr. Hook. Looking like a refugee from the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> Gold Rush, <LOCATION> Locorriere </LOCATION> _ all shaggy hair and wild beard _ acts, sings and dances his way through <PERSON> Billy </PERSON>'s various bouts with the devil and God Himself. It's a pheonomenal performance, not to mention a feat of prodigious memorization. <PERSON> Silverstein </PERSON>, poet, cartoonist and author of the country hit `` A Boy Named Sue,'' tweaks just about everybody in his short play. Its highlight is a song about the marriage of the devil to <PERSON> Billy </PERSON>'s one true love. The celebrity list runs from <PERSON> Gertrude </PERSON> <PERSON> Stein </PERSON> to <PERSON> Grandma </PERSON> <PERSON> Moses </PERSON>, from <LOCATION> Caligula </LOCATION> to <PERSON> Eva </PERSON> <PERSON> Braun </PERSON>. For <PERSON> Silverstein </PERSON>, the devil appears to be a part of just about everybody. In <PERSON> Mamet </PERSON>'s equally brief one-acter, the devil _ called the interrogator _ harasses a new arrivee named <PERSON> Bobby </PERSON> <PERSON> Gould </PERSON> in an anteroom to hell that looks like a well-appointed study. It's complete with a spiffy leather couch and walls of books Only when he opens a backdoor can you hear the screams and see the smoke of Hades. <PERSON> Bobby </PERSON>, played with credible anxiety by <PERSON> Treat </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, keeps insisting he was a good man. Not so, says the devil. `` You were cruel without being interesting,'' says Satan, portrayed here by an exasperated, almost frenzied W.H. <PERSON> Macy </PERSON>. The actor is dressed like a walking advertising for the L.L. Bean catalog. You see, <PERSON> Lucifer </PERSON> has been called back from a fishing trip to deal with <PERSON> Bobby </PERSON> and is mighty upset about the interruption. <PERSON> Bobby </PERSON>'s spurned girlfriend -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Felicity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Huffman </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- also shows up to condemn him, and the devil has a drudge assistant, played with a wonderful prissy rectitude by <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldstein </PERSON>, to further browbeat the man. The pingpong banter is sharp, often quite biting, and the production is tauntly directed by <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON> <PERSON> Mosher </PERSON> who uses several startling theatrical effects. `` The Devil and <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> <PERSON> Markham </PERSON>'' and `` <PERSON> Bobby </PERSON> <PERSON> Gould </PERSON> in Hell'' do n't exactly celebrate Beelzebub but they recognize his effect on what people say and do. And what they say and do, according to <PERSON> Silverstein </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mamet </PERSON>, is very, very funny.

 An <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> woman arrested and accused of hiding weapons for leftist rebels wants to stay in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> even if it means a prison term, former <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney General <PERSON> Ramsey </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> said Sunday. `` Every heart has to be somewhere, and her heart chose <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> said. He said <PERSON> Jennifer </PERSON> <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> <PERSON> Casolo </PERSON>, a 28-year-old native of <LOCATION> Thomaston </LOCATION>, Ct., is deeply committed to her work in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, where she represented an ecumenical group called <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Educational </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Seminars </ORGANIZATION> Ms. <PERSON> Casolo </PERSON> was arrested and jailed on Nov. 26 after rebels launched a major offensive in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>. Authorities said an arms cache including more than 20,000 rounds of rifle ammunition, 213 blocks of <ORGANIZATION> TNT </ORGANIZATION>, detonators, 106 mortar shells and other munitions were found buried in the yard of her rented home. <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> said he had hoped Ms. <PERSON> Casolo </PERSON> would accept deportation rather than stand trial, but that was not the case. `` She came here from choice. She stayed here from choice. She really loves the people,'' he said. `` She does n't want to go home.'' <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> said Ms. <PERSON> Casolo </PERSON> is to be arraigned Monday, probably before a military tribunal. <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> was retained by Ms. <PERSON> Casolo </PERSON>'s family. He is not licensed to practice law in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> and said a problem will be finding a god lawyer willing to risk defending her. He said `` it would be extremely difficult, if not impossible'' for her to get a fair trial given the pressure of war and the government's belief that many foreigners aid the rebels. More than a dozen foreign religious workers were detained by security forces in a crackdown ordered by the right-wing government last month during the rebel offensive. Most were freed with the condition they leave the country. But is is believed Ms. <PERSON> Casolo </PERSON> faces serious charges and will be tried by a military tribunal because of the nature of the accusations, <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> said. He said he did not know exactly what charges would be filed. <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> said Ms. <PERSON> Casolo </PERSON> did n't know about the munitions buried in the yard. He said Ms. <PERSON> Casolo </PERSON> moved into the house in May but was absent for long periods of time, including the entire month of September.

<HEAD>Explosives Turn Parts of Kansas Town Into Minefield</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GREAT BEND, Kan. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Hundreds of metal explosives scattered over a wide area by a fiery blast have turned parts of this city into a minefield, officials say. In the last month, Great Bend residents have found more than 30 of the explosive devices, called shaped charges, in fields and near roads, homes, schools and businesses. No one has been hurt, but officials worry that residents could continue to find the live explosives for years. `` These are high explosives,'' said Fire Chief <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Meisinger </PERSON>. `` And they are unstable now. When you're talking about an unstable explosive, who knows what could set it off? Dropping it, kicking it, driving over it, operating a ham radio near it?'' The shaped charges are considered a class C explosive, the same designation given to fireworks such as cherry bombs. <PERSON> Meisinger </PERSON> said the explosives come in two shapes _ a small round metal ball about the size of a cherry bomb and a larger cone-shaped explosive about the size of a standard grenade. About 1,100 of the explosives, which are used in oil exploration and recovery, were scattered over a one-square-mile area when an explosion followed a natural gas fire Oct. 30 at <ORGANIZATION> Wire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tech </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, an oil field service company. Only 600 have been accounted for, <PERSON> Meisinger </PERSON> said. It is not known how many explosives detonated in the fire. City fire investigators attributed the blast to leaking natural gas that seeped from a broken gas pipe inside the building and ignited. The explosion injured two workers, destroyed the building, forced the evacuation of about 200 people and caused more than $ 600,000 damage. <PERSON> Meisinger </PERSON> thinks the explosives could maim or even kill someone. But Kansas Fire Marshal <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Earhart </PERSON> said that although the shaped charges are dangerous, there is no reason to panic. He said they probably would not explode unless someone tried to detonate them, and they are not powerful enough to kill. `` I do n't want to minimize the danger, because if not handled properly they can injure people, but these may not be as dangerous as people think,'' he said. `` I do n't think they would detonate by simply stepping on one.''

<HEAD>Battle Lines Drawn Over Corporate Hog Farm</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEVEN K. PAULSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>KERSEY, Colo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Two billionaire families more closely identified with the boardroom than the barnyard are facing off over construction of one of the most technologically advanced hog farms in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The Bass brothers of <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, are building a hog and cattle farm along the banks of the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Platte </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> in northeastern <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Weld </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> that plans to raise 300,000 pigs and 10,000 cattle a year. `` This is something very unique,'' says <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Schneider </PERSON>, effluent manager for the hog farm. `` It has its own ecosystem, utilizing as much nitrogen as possible to go back into grass production, so we can raise cattle.'' But downstream are the 32,000-acre Eagle's Nest Ranch with 700 head of cattle owned by billionaire <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Anschutz </PERSON>, owner of <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, and the 760-acre <ORGANIZATION> Windbreak </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ranch </ORGANIZATION> owned by beer magnate <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Coors </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Adolph </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co </ORGANIZATION>. They claim that <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hog </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farms </ORGANIZATION>, which is building the new farm, is trying experimental farm techniques and if the experiment fails, it could pollute their land. The farm plans to use no antibiotics or other drugs on the animals, which are commonly used elsewhere. It also plans to spray waste water on the land to fertilize native grasses, which in turn would feed cattle. Coors and <PERSON> Anschutz </PERSON> are financially backing environmentalists who oppose the operation, and have filed lawsuits in a yet-unsuccessful attempt to block it. Weld County Commissioner <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> Brantner </PERSON> calls it a duel between billionaires that the county wants no part of. `` Let them go down to the courts to decide who is right or wrong,'' said <PERSON> Brantner </PERSON>, whose family helped settle the county and is featured in <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Michener </PERSON>'s novel `` Centennial.'' The issues involved _ land and water _ are as old as <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>, and important in a region that receives only 15 inches of precipitation annually. Also at stake are 200 jobs provided by the new hog farm, a crucial factor in an economy that has been hit hard the past few years by declines in the oil industry and land values. The farm, scheduled for completion in 1992, would have its own weather station and sewage treatment plant. Trucks entering the farm will be disinfected and workers will be required to shower and change into sterile clothes before entering. Grown hogs will be transported to neighboring states for slaughter. `` They're on the leading edge, doing things that have n't been done in other places,'' said <PERSON> Schneider </PERSON>. `` I ca n't say 100 percent sure something wo n't go wrong, but if it does, it will be minimal.'' Financial backers include investor <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Bass </PERSON>, whose wealth has been estimated by <ORGANIZATION> Forbes </ORGANIZATION> magazine at $ 1.44 billion; <PERSON> Sid </PERSON> <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON> <PERSON> Bass </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> <PERSON> Bass </PERSON>, who are valued at an estimated $ 1.25 billion; and <ORGANIZATION> Edward </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Perry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bass </ORGANIZATION>, at $ 1 billion. They made their money in oil, gas and farming. <PERSON> Anschutz </PERSON> has a net worth of $ 1.2 billion and <ORGANIZATION> Coors </ORGANIZATION> owns or controls properties worth further millions. Both have refused to comment publicly on the battle, preferring to work through environmental groups and the courts. They're worried about the 2.2 million gallons of waste water the farm will generate each day and the 24-hour holding capacity in the sewage tanks. The concern is that if those tanks fail or break down, the wastes could wind up in the wells from which the <PERSON> Anschutz </PERSON> and Coors ranches pump their drinking water. They're also afraid the hog farm will harm the pheasants and geese they like to hunt on their property, the fish they catch in their private ponds, and the nearby <LOCATION> Riverside </LOCATION> reservoir, a refuge for geese and pelicans. They point to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hog </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farms </ORGANIZATION> operation in <LOCATION> Atkinson </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Neb. </LOCATION>, which has been sued five times for air pollution, water pollution and allegedly causing pseudo-rabies, resulting in a quarantine of that farm's hogs. Coors and <PERSON> Anschutz </PERSON> are financially backing an organization called Protect Our Water, which has started a petition drive to regulate what they say was an unforeseen development in American farming. <PERSON> Schneider </PERSON> admits some of the farming techniques are experimental, but says the theories are sound. The farm has built 16 monitoring wells to check for ground water contamination. The weather station will have solar panels to monitor irrigation to match water usage. The hog units will be air conditioned and hermetically sealed to keep out disease, while refrigerated trucks will dispose of dead animals. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Stovell </PERSON>, who manages the Eagle Nest Ranch for <PERSON> Anschutz </PERSON>, said <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hog </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farms </ORGANIZATION> also tried experimental techniques in <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION> and some of those failed. <PERSON> Schneider </PERSON> acknowledged there have been problems in <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION>, most stemming from the use of lagoon drainage for wastes. He said the company learned a lot from those mistakes and corrected the problems in the new operation. <PERSON> Stovell </PERSON> acknowledged that the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Platte </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, a main focus of the current battle, already is polluted, partly from cattle operations farther upstream. `` We're not totally opposed to the company in this case. If they set up adequate handling facilities, that's fine,'' <PERSON> Stovell </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Stovell </PERSON> said he will continue his petition drive and lawsuits against the operation, although he has n't had much luck because the facility meets county regulations. <PERSON> Stovell </PERSON> said stricter regulations do n't exist because no one foresaw scientific corporate farms like this. He wants county regulations changed to control the amount of wastes that can be released.

 E.J. <ORGANIZATION> Brach </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sons </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, caterer to <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s sweet tooth for 85 years, wants to make its candy with foreign sugar, which is leaving a bad taste in the mouths of competitors who must use more costly domestic supplies <PERSON> Brach </PERSON>'s bid carries a heavy threat: If the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> does n't allow it to buy foreign sugar, the <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> company says it may close its aging factory in a poor <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> neighborhood, taking 3,500 jobs elsewhere. But if <PERSON> Brach </PERSON> wins, candy makers claim it will have a remarkable advantage over the rest of the industry, because sugar from abroad sells for about a dime less per pound than domestic versions, resulting in an annual savings to <PERSON> Brach </PERSON> of about $ 20 million. A public comment period on <PERSON> Brach </PERSON>'s proposal was to expire Nov. 21, but the issue has left other candy makers so sour the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> extended the period to the end of the year. `` The essential issue here is one of fairness,'' <ORGANIZATION> Nestle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foods </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Purchase </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, said in a letter to the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Foreign-Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Zones </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>. `` If <PERSON> Brach </PERSON>'s application is granted, applications from other similarly situated manufacturers should receive equal treatment,'' <ORGANIZATION> Nestle </ORGANIZATION> said. Other competitors of <PERSON> Brach </PERSON>, which is owned by <ORGANIZATION> Jacobs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Suchard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>, let their emotions spill. `` We find this request for special status by a foreign-owned company to be insulting,'' said <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> <PERSON> Inc. </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Elizabethtown </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, parent of <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Simon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Candy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> `` They already own the lion-share of the market, and now they seek the aid of the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> in running the rest of us out of business.'' `` Lousy management of <PERSON> Brach </PERSON>,'' wrote <PERSON> Powell </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Fine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Candies </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Hopkins </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minn. </LOCATION>, `` should not be subsidized by actions of our government or its agencies.'' <PERSON> Brach </PERSON> President <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Habijanac </PERSON> countered: `` It's not a sugar issue, it's a social issue. This is 3,500 jobs. We've got a cost problem.'' The government is very protective of the domestic sugar industry. It will allow only 2.49 million tons of raw sugar into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> between Jan. 1, 1989 and Sept. 30, 1990. By comparison, the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> predicts <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> planters will produce 7 million tons during the fiscal year that began Oct. 1. Acting on <PERSON> Brach </PERSON>'s behalf, the <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Port </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> filed an application with the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign-Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Zones </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> on Sept. 26 requesting that <PERSON> Brach </PERSON>'s factory be designated a `` foreign-trade subzone,'' which would exempt the company from quota restriction on foreign sugar. The request will be decided by the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign-Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Zones </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, which is comprised of <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mosbacher </PERSON>, Treasury Secretary <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Armitage </PERSON>. A special committee is investigating the issues in the case, and a decision by the board is not expected for several months. The lobbying, however, has begun. <PERSON> Mosbacher </PERSON> has received letters of support from Illinois Gov. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Daley </PERSON>, <PERSON> Illinois </PERSON> <PERSON> Sens </PERSON>. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON> and <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, and Rep. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Rostenkowski </PERSON>, the powerful <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> Democrat who is the chief tax-writer in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>. `` I am enough of a realist to know how tall an order this is for the Foreign-Trade Zones Board. The history of proposals for sugar operations ... is familiar to both of us,'' <PERSON> Rostenkowski </PERSON> told <PERSON> Mosbacher </PERSON>. `` You might be advised to reject the idea out of hand; I hope you will resist that advice,'' he wrote. The <ORGANIZATION> Teamsters </ORGANIZATION> union, which represents <PERSON> Brach </PERSON> workers, also supports the company's position. The <PERSON> Brach </PERSON> tradition in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> is as rich as its chocolate. In 1904, German immigrant <PERSON> Emil </PERSON> <PERSON> Brach </PERSON> invested his life savings in a small store and called it <PERSON> Brach </PERSON>'s Palace of Sweets. That store grew into the huge factory on <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Side </LOCATION>, where tons of chocolate, Starlight Mints, jelly candies and licorice items are produced each week. Three years ago, <PERSON> Brach </PERSON> was sold to <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON> <PERSON> Suchard </PERSON> an international food conglomerate flush with cash. <PERSON> Brach </PERSON>'s critics say <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON> <PERSON> Suchard </PERSON> knew the risks of acquiring an antiquated factory with a large work force when it paid hundreds of millions of dollars for the company. `` Look, what we bought was an excellent brand name in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Habijanac </PERSON> said in an interview from <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. `` You always have surprises. When you buy a company you understand there are challenges.''

The fund reported a drop in inflation among industrial countries in the summer quarter of the year, July to September. Prices paid by their consumers rose at an annual 4.5 percent rate against 4.8 percent in the spring quarter. Third World countries, slower in their reporting, showed a slight drop in the annual rate for the April to June quarter: 62.7 percent instead of 63.8 percent. These figures vary widely from country to country: <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>'s annual rate was 846.5 percent and <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s 18.4 percent, while more prosperous countries in <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> had much lower rates, such as <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> ` s 5.7 percent. The fund also noted a strengthening of the dollar in October. Compared with other major currencies, it was worth 4.42 percent more than in October 1988. In the same period, the Japanese yen dropped by 9.95 percent, the British pound by 7.96 percent and the Swiss franc by 4.26 percent. The West German mark and French franc showed small increases.

<HEAD>Pennwalt Buyer To Move Headquarters to Philadelphia, Change Pennwalt
Name</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The French company that bought <ORGANIZATION> Pennwalt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> in October plans to make <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> the headquarters for its North American chemical operations, but <ORGANIZATION> Pennwalt </ORGANIZATION> will lose its name in the process. <ORGANIZATION> Atochem </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> S.A. </ORGANIZATION>, the international chemical arm of <ORGANIZATION> Societe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nationale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elf </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aquitaine </ORGANIZATION>, said that next month it would combine its three <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> chemical businesses, including Philadelphia-based <ORGANIZATION> Pennwalt </ORGANIZATION>, and call the new subsidiary <LOCATION> Atochem </LOCATION> <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. The subsidiary will generate annual sales of $ 1.5 billion a year and employ about 5,000, company officials said Friday. `` I believe this is a very positive and exciting step for <LOCATION> Atochem </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Jacques </PERSON> <PERSON> Puechal </PERSON>, who oversees <ORGANIZATION> Atochem </ORGANIZATION>'s global operations, told employees. `` It is good news for <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> to become the home base of a larger entity. <ORGANIZATION> Pennwalt </ORGANIZATION> has played an important role in the business, civic and cultural life of the city.'' Before the meeting, <PERSON> Puechal </PERSON> said <PERSON> Atochem </PERSON> was consolidating operations to ease internal communication among three businesses and to better serve customers. <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> was chosen as the headquarters site because <ORGANIZATION> Pennwalt </ORGANIZATION> represented the largest of the company's three <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> American operations and would involve displacing the least amount of workers, he said. As part of the aquisition agreement, <ORGANIZATION> Pennwalt </ORGANIZATION> was supposed to keep its name, which the 139-year-old company traces to its original name of <ORGANIZATION> Pennsylvania </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Salt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Seymour </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Preston </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, who has been <ORGANIZATION> Pennwalt </ORGANIZATION>'s president and chief operating officer and who will head the reorganized business in the same capacity, told employees that he and other members of the planning committee had `` spent substantial time and effort and emotion'' wrestling with the name change The committee chose <ORGANIZATION> Atochem </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> because the name offers the greatest recognition worldwide for the business, he said. Absent from the new lineup of executives was <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Tuttle </PERSON>, who has led <ORGANIZATION> Pennwalt </ORGANIZATION> as chairman and chief executive officer for 11 years. He said he would be vice chairman of the new firm until it got in its feet and would then retire. In all, about 75 positions will be eliminated from the companies, <PERSON> Preston </PERSON> said, but the consolidation will bring to <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> area at least 150 new jobs, officials said. Most of the jobs will be located at <ORGANIZATION> Pennwalt </ORGANIZATION>'s headquarters. About 450 employees work there now. <PERSON> Preston </PERSON> said the company would look for ways for the new company to become more efficient. He did not rule out further reductions in employment but said that might be achieved through attrition.

<HEAD>Milkman Once Again Makes Home Deliveries</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>

 Local businessman <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Tomaso </PERSON> is milking a combination of nostalgia and convenience by offering suburbanites a taste of what life was like when dairy products were home-delivered in glass bottles. Thousands of suburban families are returning to days of old when milk was left on the front porch. <PERSON> Tomaso </PERSON>, his wife, <PERSON> Shirley </PERSON>, and their two sons started a home milk delivery business last spring, using direct mail advertising to pitch their product. `` We've been wildly successful, far beyond our wildest expectations,'' the <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> businessman said. <PERSON> Tomaso </PERSON>'s wife estimated the family has close to 1,000 customers in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>'s northern suburbs, who have milk in glass bottles, other dairy products and even fresh-squeezed orange juice placed in blue boxes on their porches. <PERSON> Tomaso </PERSON> buys his products from <ORGANIZATION> Oberweis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dairy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Aurora </LOCATION>, which has four other vendors delivering milk in suburban <PERSON> Cook </PERSON> and DuPage counties. `` Home milk delivery kind of died out for a long period of time, but it's coming back, particularly to the double-income families that like the convenience of having milk delivered,'' said <PERSON> Elaine </PERSON> <PERSON> Oberweis </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Oberweis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dairy </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Oberweis </PERSON> hung in while other small dairies and home deliverers succumbed to competition from supermarkets, government price controls and the growth of the soft-drink industry, Mrs. <PERSON> Oberweis </PERSON> said. The company plans to expand home delivery after years of dropping sales, she said. The milk-delivery companies say they can operate at a healthy profit. Each vendor seems to have his own system: Some sell the products at store prices but add a service charge of $ 1 for each delivery, while others charge 10 cents to 75 cents more per product. <PERSON> Tomaso </PERSON> said nostalgia might be a factor in the milkman's return, but other factors come into play as well. `` Part of the nostalia trip would be to be out there with a horse, but nostalgia only goes so far,'' he said. `` It has to taste good, too.'' Convenience appears to be a top reason for most customers. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> and <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> Turkot </PERSON> moved to <LOCATION> Wheaton </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> about six years ago and said their four children, who consume about five gallons of milk each week, made milk buying a continuous chore. `` This is a lot more convenient,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Turkot </PERSON> said of the milk delivery service. She added that she thinks the milk tastes better, too. `` I do n't know what it is,'' she said. `` I guess it's that the cardboard has a funny taste, and with the glass bottles, you do n't get that.

<HEAD>Communist Party Gives Resounding Rejection to Private Ownership</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> has issued a resounding rejection of private ownership, saying public ownership has become `` an irreversible trend.'' In a ringing endorsement of orthodox Marxist ideology, the party newspaper <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> lambasted the most cherished of capitalist principles. `` Can ` paradise' be found in capitalist countries? Absolutely not,'' the paper said in a lengthy commentary Saturday. `` Political regimes that are based on privatized economies breed all forms of corruption,'' the People's Daily said. `` The innate character of the bourgeois dictatorship of capitalist private ownership is a dictatorship of the rich minority over a poor majority.'' In 1848 <PERSON> Karl </PERSON> <PERSON> Marx </PERSON> summarized the theory of communism in a single phrase: `` eradicating private ownership,'' the People's Daily said. `` For half a century, many countries under the leadership of communist parties have established the great struggle of public ownership to wipe out privatization, and this has become an irreversible historical trend,'' it said. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> stepped up its calls to adhere to strict Marxist doctrine and reject `` bourgeois liberalism,'' or Western ideas, following the short-lived pro-democracy movement this spring. The student-led movement sought political reforms but widened to call for increased freedoms including better education, a less controlled economy and higher wages. After the movement was violently crushed by the Chinese army, leaving hundreds dead, top leaders orchestrated a return to doctrinaire slogans, ordering the mass media to follow the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> line and selectively report positive news. Government leaders have also rejected political pluralism and have continued to crackdown on political dissent. The paper said those who support private ownership claim that Chinese yearn to leave the country for overseas, even agreeing to be `` third-rate citizens'' of other nations. `` This is pure rumor,'' People's Daily said. `` Most Chinese people studying or working abroad love their homeland.'' Thousands of Chinese overseas, however, do seek ways to remain abroad rather than return to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, where they face low-paying jobs which they may not be able to choose, and drab living conditions. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> diplomats in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> say that more than 90 percent of Chinese who go to study in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> do not come back.
