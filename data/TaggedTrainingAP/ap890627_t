 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is weighing changes in campaign finance law to limit the multimillion-dollar influence of special-interest political action committees, officials said Tuesday. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> indicated in a news conference that he has not made his final decisions on what he will propose Thursday in the way of revamping the federal campaign finance laws. But officials said he is considering a version of his previously announced wish for a ban on political action committee contributions, which in the 1988 election amounted to $ 151.3 million for congressional campaigns, according to <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Election </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> records. One administration official, speaking only on condition of anonymity, said other proposals <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is reviewing include: _ Barring members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> from carrying over campaign fund surpluses from one election to the next Members who win their races handily sometimes amass huge warchests by rolling over the funds from one year to the next. _ Setting up a system in which executive branch agencies would have to log calls they received from members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> trying to sway them on a policy _ Limiting the amount congressional incumbents could spend on mailings with their `` franking'' privileges Critics say these mailings to constituents give the incumbents unfair advantage over election challengers at the expense of the taxpayers. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has made at least one decision, according to unidentified officials quoted in Wednesday editions of The Washington Post: to seek legislation outlawing ` gerrymandering,'' the drawing of congressional districts to favor one party. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> would request a new requirement _ that districts be compact, contiguous and respecting community boundaries in addition to current court-enforced requirements that a state's districts contains equal numbers of people as nearly as possible. Instead of ruling out all PACs, the options he is now considering would ban corporate or labor union PACs, according to the official. The options would allow those that are not connected to such groups, so-called ideological PACs that are centered on a political philosophy or agenda. The president also is looking at the possibility of lowering the current $ 5,000 per candidate limit for PAC contributions to $ 1,000. In the category of banned PACs, if <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> agrees to this option, would be so-called leadership PACs, those headed by politicians and used to dispense campaign funds to other candidates. They also are used as a springboard for presidential candidates, including <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who headed the one of the nation's two most successful PACs in the years before his presidential bid. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told reporters that one proposal he will not adopt is a system of public financing for congressional campaigns, as is now the system for the presidential elections. `` I oppose public financing of these campaigns. I think people should be able to attract private support, and I think participation by individuals in a the political process through financial support is very, very important,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. Current law allows individuals to contribute a maximum of $ 1,000 per candidate in each election, while PACs may give $ 5,000. Some groups and members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> advocate setting up a federal fund to pay for congressional races after the model now used for the presidential elections and supported by the voluntary $ 1 checkoff on individual income tax forms. Besides speaking against that idea, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he would not reveal any specifics of his thinking on campaign finance reform before Thursday, when he speaks to a group of congressional interns at the Library of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. White House spokeswoman <PERSON> Alixe </PERSON> <PERSON> Glen </PERSON> said the intention of the president's plan will be `` to strengthn the parties, increase competition and fairness in elections and to curtail special interest'' in campaigns. `` I will have specific proposals,'' he said, adding they would be `` fairly far reaching because I want to see reform _ real reform.'' If he calls on <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to outlaw leadership PACs, he will be speaking against an increasingly influential funding mechanism that many presidential contenders use in their pre-announcement phase to finance their travels around the country to whip up support. Officially, such PACs are set up to help like-minded candidates for congressional or other offices and are not allowed to fund presidential campaign activity. But there is little doubt that they serve immense benefit for politicians who are preparing a White House bid. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s PAC, called Fund For <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s Future, was the second largest of some 4,000 PACs that file records with the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Election </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Comission </ORGANIZATION>. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> PAC raised $ 9.4 million in the years when it was most active, the 1985-86 campaign cycle, second only to the conservative <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> founded by Sen. <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Helms </PERSON>, R-N. The <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> and its affiliated groups raised $ 16.6 million. The corporate PACs were led by <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> T </ORGANIZATION>'s which raised $ 1.8 million, <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Election </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> records show. Of labor-related PACs, the <ORGANIZATION> Teamsters </ORGANIZATION> had the largest, raising $ 4.4 million that cycle. Among the trade association-related PACs, the Realtors' PAC raised $ 5.7 million and the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PAC </ORGANIZATION>, just under $ 5 million. In the 1987-88 election cycle, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> PAC </ORGANIZATION> raised just under $ 2 million as his presidential campaign geared up and fund-raising efforts were diverted to it. In the primary season, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s campaign received $ 862,950 in contributions from special-interest PACs.

 A well-preserved ship believed to be a 17th century Spanish galleon loaded with gold has been found in 1,500 feet of water near the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Keys </LOCATION>, according to a salvage company. Much of the wooden vessel and its cargo appears to be intact because of the pressure and temperature of the water. `` It's worth a fortune in history.'' <PERSON> Greg </PERSON> <PERSON> Stemm </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION> businessman who hopes to recover the riches, told The <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petersburg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> for an article published Wednesday. <PERSON> Stemm </PERSON> believes the wreck is the <ORGANIZATION> Nuestra </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senora </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> de </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> la </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Merced </ORGANIZATION>, a Spanish Colonial galleon believed to have vanished during the same hurricane 350 years ago that felled another galleon, the <LOCATION> Nuestra </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Senora </LOCATION> <LOCATION> de </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Atocha </LOCATION>. The Atocha, laden with gold and silver, was found by treasure hunter <PERSON> Mel </PERSON> <PERSON> Fisher </PERSON> in 1985, about 50 miles north of <PERSON> Stemm </PERSON>'s discovery. If <PERSON> Stemm </PERSON>'s research proves correct, the wreck he discovered could hold a treasure worth millions. <PERSON> Stemm </PERSON>, 32, is co-owner of a deep-sea research company that discovered the sunken vessel in April. <ORGANIZATION> Seahawk </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deep </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ocean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tampa </ORGANIZATION> plans to disclose the details of its remote-camera exploration of the ship on Wednesday. Archaeologist and treasure hunters are hoping photos prove it's the Merced, sunk in 1622. `` This is just like a time capsule because nothing's been touched,'' said <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bagley </PERSON>, a Seahawk director. By the end of the summer, the salvors aboard <PERSON> Stemm </PERSON>'s 85-foot research vessel Seahawk will begin a full-scale operation to retrieve the fragile artifacts and confirm the ship's identity. So far, they have discovered a ship's bell and a number of olive jars that could be filled with wine, food and other commodities. The project could take up to two years. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, a state archaeologist, said he has talked to the salvors about the importance of preserving the artifacts and other salvageable items from the wreck. `` Regardless of what vessel it is, archaeologically, it's an extremely significant site,'' <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said. `` If you consider the historic value, it's very great. The other side of that question is the monetary value.''

 A federal appeals court Tuesday overturned the conviction of former <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration aide <PERSON> Lyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Nofziger </PERSON> for illegally lobbying his <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> colleagues months after he left the government. In a 2-1 ruling, the panel said <PERSON> Nofziger </PERSON>'s 1988 conviction must `` be set aside because it is not based on a finding that he had knowledge of each element of the offenses'' he was accused of committing. `` The government was required to prove that he had knowledge of all of the facts making his conduct criminal,'' said the decision written by <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Buckley </PERSON>. <PERSON> Buckley </PERSON> was joined by judge <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>. Both are <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> appointees. Appeals court judge <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON>, a <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> administration appointee, dissented, saying there was `` no basis for overturning <PERSON> Nofziger </PERSON>'s conviction.'' Asked at a news conference whether he thought he had gotten off on a legal technicality, <PERSON> Nofziger </PERSON> said, `` Absolutely no. ... I think they came after me on a technicality.'' <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> McKay </PERSON>, the independent counsel who prosecuted <PERSON> Nofziger </PERSON>, issued a statement saying he `` will consider his options to pursue further appellate review of this decision.'' The prosecutor could seek a review by the entire federal appeals court in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> or appeal to the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and other high level administration officials were clearly pleased. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, asked at a state dinner honoring Australian Prime Minister <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Hawke </PERSON> what he thought of the ruling, smiled broadly and said only, `` I'm always glad when soembody is found not guilty of something.'' Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> was more effusive, calling the decision `` terrific.'' Vice President <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said it was good news and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s chief of staff, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> said he had called <PERSON> Nofziger </PERSON> to congratulate him and let him know `` at least some of his old friends had n't forgotten him. The case against <PERSON> Nofziger </PERSON>, President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> political director in 1981, was the first major test of the revolving-door provisions of the Ethics in Government Act. The law imposes a one-year ban on lobbying former government colleagues once an upper-echelon employee leaves service in the executive branch. <PERSON> Nofziger </PERSON> said he was `` certainly pleased'' by the decision. `` I think I was innocent from the beginning; I still think I am innocent,'' he said. He was convicted Feb. 11, 1988, of three counts of illegally lobbying top presidential aides on behalf of private clients after he left the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> one year into the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration. The clients were scandal-plagued <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, a maritime engineers union and the manufacturer of the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>'s A-10 anti-tank plane. <PERSON> Nofziger </PERSON>, who is 65, was sentenced to 90 days in prison and fined $ 30,000. He said that defending himself cost `` a bundle, a bundle,'' with legal fees running over $ 1.5 million and `` I suppose, more than that'' in lost income. As a lobbyist accused of felonies, `` you not only lose clients, you do n't get clients.'' But he acknowledged he has been able to keep his business going while the case made its way through the courts. Asked about the `` revolving door'' provisions of the ethics law under which he was prosecuted, <PERSON> Nofziger </PERSON> said, `` I do n't think I am part of any revolving door syndrome.'' `` People lobby in this town; the main industry in this town besides government is lobbying,'' he said. The ethics law prohibits executive branch officials from `` knowingly'' acting as agents or attorneys before their old agencies within one year after leaving the government. <PERSON> Nofziger </PERSON> contended the word `` knowingly'' also applied to a prohibition against making `` oral or written communications'' to their previous government colleagues on matters in which the agency had `` a direct and substantial interest'' within one year. Prosecutors said the word `` knowingly'' referred only to acting as an agent or attorney. `` This is not an idle grammatical inquiry,'' said <PERSON> Buckley </PERSON>'s ruling `` If <PERSON> Nofziger </PERSON>'s interpretation is correct, no one may be convicted ... unless it is proven that he had knowledge of each of the facts constituting the offense.'' The court found that the wording was ambiguous. `` Canons of statutory construction require that an ambiguous criminal statute be interpreted in the defendant's favor,'' said <PERSON> Buckley </PERSON>. The prosecutors never alleged that <PERSON> Nofziger </PERSON> knew his former colleagues had a direct and substantial interest in the matters on which he was lobbying them. Under the prosecution's theory, `` if an ex-official tries to interest his former agency in a particular project in the mistaken belief that it had no ` direct and substantial interest' in it, he will have committed a felony punishable by up to two years in jail,'' said <PERSON> Buckley </PERSON>. In his dissent, <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> said the law was clear and that the word `` knowingly'' did n't apply to the provisions under which <PERSON> Nofziger </PERSON> was convicted. `` The majority has labored mightily to find an ambiguity,'' said <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON>. But there is no ambiguity to resolve `` and, consequently, no basis for overturning <PERSON> Nofziger </PERSON>'s conviction,'' he said. `` I can not comprehend my colleagues' convoluted attempts to embrace'' <PERSON> Nofziger </PERSON>'s `` fancied ambiguity, and their ... willingness to ignore clear legislative history and engage in overt legislating,'' said <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON>. <PERSON> Buckley </PERSON> and <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> remanded the case to the <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> `` for proceedings consistent with this opinion.'' `` The <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> should have dismissed the indictment filed by the prosecution,'' said the decision. A federal court jury found <PERSON> Nofziger </PERSON> guilty of illegally using his influence by sending an April 8, 1982, memo to then-presidential counselor <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>. The memo suggested that <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> enlist the support of President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and others to persuade the Army to give a no-bid contract to build small gasoline engines to <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION>, which in the last years of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration became the focus of a massive federal corruption probe. While he was attorney general, <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> himself came under criminal investigation in connection with <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION>. He was n't prosecuted <PERSON> Nofziger </PERSON> also was convicted of sending an Aug. 20, 1982, memo to <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Jenkins </PERSON>, <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s deputy, urging the administration to put civilian sailors on <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> vessels. The policy was being pushed by the <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beneficial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, which paid <PERSON> Nofziger </PERSON>'s lobbying firm $ 100,000 a year Additionally, the jury said <PERSON> Nofziger </PERSON> illegally lobbied two <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> officials about continued production of the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>'s A-10 anti-tank plane, which was made by <ORGANIZATION> Fairchild </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>.

 <PERSON> Rene </PERSON> <PERSON> Acuna </PERSON> is starving himself to protest a life prison sentence, but he's on a well-worn road that state corrections officials say will end in court-ordered force feeding. `` I am innocent and I do n't eat,'' said <PERSON> Acuna </PERSON>, a Cuban immigrant who speaks broken English. <PERSON> Acuna </PERSON>, 37, of <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>, stopped eating _ except for water and sugared coffee _ March 3 after he was convicted of conspiracy and delivery of two pounds of cocaine. His sentence is life without parole. <PERSON> Acuna </PERSON> once carried 180 pounds on his 5-foot, 5-inch frame. As of Friday, he had lost 64 pounds. His body swims in his prison blues. His cheeks are sunken. `` I see the food like a chair, like a sofa. The hunger? When you have a reason to support your spirit and your mind, you do n't need anything more,'' he said in a telephone interview from the hospital at the State Prison of <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, near <LOCATION> Jackson </LOCATION>. But a series of court rulings across the nation have upheld the power of prison officials to force feed inmates on long-term hunger strikes. Corrections experts say no record is kept of how many hunger strikes occur each year in American prisons, but they believe long ones are rare. Typically, courts decide that prison authorities' need to control their institutions outweighs prisoners' rights to privacy and control of their bodies, said <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Koren </PERSON>, staff assistant for the National Prison Project of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>. `` Obviously, they have an interest in controlling the institution and when a prisoner does something like this, he is embarrassing the heck out of them,'' he said. Department of Corrections officials label <PERSON> Acuna </PERSON>'s hunger strike a publicity stunt, and have doctors check him each day. The department will go to court to get the authority to force feed him if his condition worsens, said <PERSON> Leo </PERSON> <PERSON> Lalonde </PERSON>, deputy director of the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corrections </ORGANIZATION>, adding `` that could be today. That could be tomorrow.'' <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> officials seek such authority about 10 times a year in order to safeguard the health of inmates who refuse food or medical care, said <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> DeWitt </PERSON>, spokesman for Attorney General <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Kelley </PERSON>. <PERSON> Acuna </PERSON>'s lawyers say his determination poses an ethical dilemma. `` This is the stuff ` <LOCATION> L.A. </LOCATION> Law' is written about. What do you do when your client wants to die?'' asked <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Neuhard </PERSON>, director of the <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> Appellate Defender's office, which will handle the appeal of <PERSON> Acuna </PERSON>'s drug convictions. `` I told him if he dies from not eating, even if he is innocent, his appeal will be stopped right then,'' said <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Girard </PERSON>, director of <ORGANIZATION> Prison </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Legal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Michigan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. In a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> case, inmate <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Calk </PERSON> decided to starve himself to death rather than serve a 180-year sentence. <PERSON> Arpy </PERSON> <PERSON> Saunders </PERSON>, <PERSON> Calk </PERSON>'s lawyer, said the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hampshire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> allowed authorities to force-feed <PERSON> Calk </PERSON> to keep him alive so that he could face another charge pending in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. `` It was n't up to him to determine how long he should serve,'' said <PERSON> Saunders </PERSON>, summarizing the court's ruling. <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Chapman </PERSON>, sentenced to 20 years to life for the murder of former Beatle <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Lennon </PERSON>, staged a hunger strike to call attention to starving children. But the appellate division of the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> decided prison security needs outweighed <PERSON> Chapman </PERSON>'s claim that the right to privacy includes a right to refuse to eat. One exception to that philosophy came in <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, where inmate <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Prevatte </PERSON> won a lawsuit to prevent authorities from force-feeding him, but eventually ended his hunger strike, aimed at winning transfer to another prison system, said <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corrections </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Siler </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> Georgia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> found force-feeding was too great an invasion of an inmate's right to privacy, saying the state `` has no right to destroy a person's will by frustrating his attempt to die if necessary to make a point.''

 A fear of flying has cost a former British member of the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> $ 1,240, the fine imposed by a court because he refused to fasten his airplane seat belt. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Cottrell </PERSON>, 45, was arrested at <LOCATION> Heathrow </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> on May 24 after arriving from <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> on a <ORGANIZATION> Lufthansa </ORGANIZATION> flight.

At the magistrate's court hearing, the defense said <PERSON> Cottrell </PERSON>'s fear of flying was the reason he refused to fasten his seat belt <PERSON> Cottrell </PERSON> went to the cockpit door and told the pilot, `` I am a member of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>,'' after he was told international regulations required all passengers to wear seat belts, the court was told.

He returned to his seat about two minutes before the landing. Defense attorney <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Darby </PERSON> said his client `` for some considerable time had a large-scale phobia of flying. It arose out of an incident 15 years ago when he was a passenger in a light aircraft forced to make an emergency landing. He was badly shaken up by it.''

 Workers in boats scooped blobs of congealed oil the size of basketballs and bigger from the <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> on Monday and tried to contain the 800,000-gallon oil spill, the biggest of three weekend spills. Deep-water booms were installed to keep the heavy oil on the <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> from moving out to sea. Skimmers sent out after a Uruguayan tanker ran aground early Saturday could n't handle the dense oil blobs and jammed. Coast Guard Capt. <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Murdock </PERSON> said Monday a call was issued for more boats, and 300 <ORGANIZATION> Delaware </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guardsmen </ORGANIZATION> were activated to help 250 private contractor employees scoop the goey mess from the water. However, federal officials said shoreline damage in <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> was almost nonexistent. That was because the oil congealed and did not wash up like lighter oils spilled over the weekend in <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and crude oil spilled earlier this year along the coast of <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>. Near <LOCATION> Newport </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> R.I. </LOCATION>, the 420,000 gallons of lighter oil that spilled from a tanker after it hit a reef had largely dispersed or evaporated by Monday morning, officials said. Conditions were `` much, much better than yesterday,'' said <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Morin </PERSON>, a state environmental official. Coast Guard Capt. <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> Providence </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> R.I. </LOCATION>, marine safety office said there was no evidence that anything but human error played a role in the spill. He said there was no evidence of mechanical failure and noted that the ship's captain, <PERSON> Iakovos </PERSON> <PERSON> Georgudis </PERSON>, told Gov. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> DiPrete </PERSON> he had made a mistake. <PERSON> DiPrete </PERSON> said over the weekend that <PERSON> Georgudis </PERSON> told him he erred in plotting the ship's course. A harbor pilot on his way to a rendezvous with the tanker tried to warn the ship it was heading into dangerous waters, but his radio message came too late, <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> reported in Tuesday's editions The newspaper quoted Capt. <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Fisher </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Northeast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pilots </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Newport </ORGANIZATION>, as saying that the harbor pilot, Capt. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON>, gave such an account to <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> investigators. In <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, most of the oil spilled Friday in the <ORGANIZATION> Houston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ship </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Channel </ORGANIZATION> by the collision of a tanker and an oil barge was concentrated in a smaller channel by wind and waves from approaching Tropical Storm <PERSON> Allison </PERSON>, allowing the use of huge vacuum machines to pick up the oil. By Monday afternoon, about two-thirds of the 6,000 barrels spilled had been recovered, said <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Morehead </PERSON>. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, the president's press secretary, <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>, complained Monday that the oil industry was moving too slowly on oil-spill cleanup technology and said the latest spills show ` the pervasiveness of the problem.'' He said they also underscored the need for legislation to better define tanker owners' liabilities. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> ruled out a moratorium on new oil drilling and exploration, as some have urged in the wake of the spills. Master Chief Petty Officer <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Kosch </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, said he doubted any investigations into the spills had reached conclusions. <PERSON> Kosch </PERSON> said it's usually weeks before such probes reach preliminary findings. In <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Murdock </PERSON> said there wo n't be any problems unless the oil spilled when the tanker <PERSON> Presidente </PERSON> <PERSON> Rivera </PERSON> ran aground somehow warmed to 95 degrees or higher and liquefied. Oil blobs were floating intact below the surface of the 60 - to 65-degree water, he said `` Yesterday we had a clump that had to be 30 gallons in one piece,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Gartin </PERSON>, operations manager for <ORGANIZATION> J </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; J Spill Service, <LOCATION> Norristown </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION> `` It was about four feet by four feet and three feet deep. We just broke pieces off and stuffed them in bags.'' <PERSON> Gartin </PERSON> said the oil was staying pretty much in the <LOCATION> Claymont </LOCATION> area, just south of the <LOCATION> Pennsylvania-Delaware </LOCATION> border. But tidal action moved the oil back and forth, up and down the river, and globs were spotted as far north as <LOCATION> Ridley </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, on the outskirts of <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>; and as far south as <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Castle </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Del. </LOCATION>, about 30 miles downstream. <PERSON> Gartin </PERSON> said he doubted the oil will be cleaned up by the end of the week. <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> wildlife officials worked to protect <LOCATION> Pea </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Patch </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, in the river south of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Castle </LOCATION>, which is home to several species of nesting shorebirds. Crews laid 1,700 feet of oil-retaining booms along the island. As of Monday, only one bird had died, said <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Nugent </PERSON>, manager of the <ORGANIZATION> Tinicum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, located near <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>. The cause of the tanker's grounding was under investigation. Drug and alcohol tests were performed on everyone involved in navigating the ship. The results were not immediately available. In <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sound </LOCATION>, only a few small patches of oil could be seen Monday, state and federal officials said. `` The worst is over,'' said <PERSON> Debbie </PERSON> <PERSON> Payton </PERSON>, an oceanographer with the <ORGANIZATION> Natonal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oceanographic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atmospheric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>. She estimated no more than 5 percent of the highly toxic oil remained floating on the water. One of the heaviest patches of remaining oil was just east of <LOCATION> Block </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, but no booms were flown there because the island's most sensitive shore is on the opposite side, officials said There had been some reports of lobsters killed and several small birds found dead, but officials said those did not appear to be widespread. Agents from the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> and three other state and federal agencies met with <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> attorneys to begin their investigation of the accident, said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> <PERSON> Almond </PERSON>. The Coast Guard planned hearings Tuesday into the <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> spills. State beaches from <LOCATION> Jamestown </LOCATION> almost to <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> remained closed as a precaution, although eastern beaches were open. A statewide shellfishing ban remained in effect. In <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, heavy rain from the approaching tropical storm slowed cleanup Monday, but three more huge vacuum machines were brought in to help the cleanup for a total of a dozen on the scene, <PERSON> Morehead </PERSON> said. `` The wind makes the -LRB- water -RRB- choppy and the rain is a pain in the neck, but they're still going ahead,'' he said. Much of the area affected by that spill was industrial.

 <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> and its clerical workers' union said Monday they have reached tentative agreement on their first contract, culminating 17 years of labor organizing and four months of negotiations. The union's chief negotiator, <PERSON> Kristine </PERSON> <PERSON> Rondeau </PERSON>, said the pact would provide pay raises averaging 32 percent over the next three years. `` It's the prettiest contract you've ever seen,'' said <PERSON> Rondeau </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> laboratory assistant who led the campaign that succeeded last year in organizing the 3,500 workers over strenuous opposition from the university. `` It's got great economics and cooperative labor-management relations, and it addresses the concerns of working women,'' she said. Former <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Secretary of Labor <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dunlop </PERSON>, a professor of economics at <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION>, led the university's bargaining team. The negotiators, who had been meeting since February, said they reached agreement in principle late Sunday night. The <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Clerical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> is scheduled to hold a ratification vote Thursday. The tentative contract provides several new benefits, including a $ 50,000 annual scholarship fund for child care and eight weeks of paid maternity leave. It also gives the workers free use of the university's athletic facilities, increases their dental and pension benefits and raises the university's contribution to their health insurance premiums to 85 percent from 70 percent. The union, which is affiliated with the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Municipal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Employees </ORGANIZATION>, represents secretaries, library aides, laboratory personnel and mailroom workers throughout the university. The effort to form a union among the clerical workers, 83 percent of whom are women, began in 1972. It culminated in a May 17, 1988, vote that the labor organizers won by 44 votes, or less than 2 percent of the total cast in the 1,530-1 ,486 decision Harvard President <PERSON> Derek </PERSON> <PERSON> Bok </PERSON>, a former law professor whose academic writings have been supportive of labor unions, opposed the union's formation. The university challenged the vote before the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> but lost. <PERSON> Bok </PERSON> said Monday the university will work with the union to complete and sign the formal contract. `` We look forwad with increasing confidence to a positive relationshp between <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> and the union,'' he said. <PERSON> Rondeau </PERSON> said <PERSON> Dunlop </PERSON> tried to foster an atmosphere of cooperation and goodwill toward the union in the aftermath of the bitter organizing battle. `` I think he did everything that he could to change the way the university and the union related to each other, and I think he did a good job at that,'' she said. <PERSON> Dunlop </PERSON> was traveling to <LOCATION> Cambridge </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> on Monday evening and could not be reached for comment.

 <LOCATION> TANGIYE </LOCATION> <LOCATION> POL-I-CHARKI </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- _ Bearded, turbaned men slowly guide their camels, sheep and goats down the mountains and carry lambs on their shoulders along the rugged path. Women in colorful traditional dress and small children run beside the flock to keep the bleating animals from straying. They travel along the potholed road past the artillery guns and tanks and through this military checkpoint, undisturbed by the soldiers. `` We are free people,'' <PERSON> Habibullah </PERSON> said as he unloaded sacks of goods from his kneeling camel. `` We are the true spirit of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. Or maybe we're what <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> used to be.'' <PERSON> Habibullah </PERSON> and the other 15 members of his clan are among the estimated 2 million Koochi nomads who wander between winter and summer pastures, pitching their hide tents in fields, building fires and turning their sheep to graze. The Koochis, which means wanderer in the <LOCATION> Pashto </LOCATION> language, have traveled the rugged hills and valleys of Afghanstian for thousands of years. They are ethnic Pathans, like most people in eastern <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. But unlike their brothers, they never settled down. Most still divide their time between the warm lowlands around <LOCATION> Peshawar </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, and the hilly fields of northern and central <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. The 11-year-old civil war has made the journey more difficult for the Koochis. But it has n't stopped them. <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>, the capital, is a common stopping point for the <LOCATION> Koochis </LOCATION>, and their camel trains are as much a part of the urban landscape as the old bazaars, the military outposts and high-rise apartment buildings. They halt in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> at least once a year to sell camels, sheep and goats at the meat market. `` The <LOCATION> Koochi </LOCATION> people are an important part of our homeland, an important part of our tradition. We respect them,'' said <PERSON> Sulaiman </PERSON> <PERSON> Laeq </PERSON>, the minister of clans and a Politburo member. The government has tried to provide them with education, health and the benefits of progress, such as helping them purchase trucks and organize a transport union. But the Koochis have made it clear they do n't want to enter the modern world, especially if it means owing alligence to the ruling <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Afghanistan </ORGANIZATION> or any other government. In the early days of the 1978 Marxist revolution that touched off the civil war, efforts were made to force the <LOCATION> Koochis </LOCATION> to stop wandering and settle in the north. The move backfired, said the 37-year-old <PERSON> Habibullah </PERSON>. Some of the <PERSON> Koochis </PERSON> took up guns and joined the Moslem guerrillas in the battle against the Soviet-backed government troops. `` Some are still fighting, but most have returned,'' <PERSON> Habibullah </PERSON> said through a translator. Laeq and other party officials speak of the mistakes the government made while trying to bring progress to the <LOCATION> Koochis </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Koochi </PERSON> men had never been asked to serve in the Afghan armed forces, but that tradition was reversed when the Marxists seized power 11 years ago in a bloody coup. By 1985, the government had modified its policy, formally exempting the <LOCATION> Koochi </LOCATION> men from government military service. But the war has not been easy for the Koochis. They often step on land mines planted by the armed forces and by the Soviets during their nine-year intervention. And their travels frequently take them into battle zones near <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION>, an eastern city under rebel siege since early March. `` This war has been very bad for our people,'' says another <LOCATION> Koochi </LOCATION> leader, <PERSON> Azizullah </PERSON>. `` The bombs, and rockets and land mines have killed so many of our people.'' Occasionally, he says, the rebels demand money to allow them to pass through guerrilla-controlled territory. Often the roads are neither open nor safe, forcing the <LOCATION> Koochis </LOCATION> to travel through the mountains and turning an easy one-day journey into a dangerous, two-week affair. `` We are our own people. We do n't want to be on either side,'' says <PERSON> Azizullah </PERSON>. `` We do n't want anyone else's war.''

 Like many small <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> towns, <LOCATION> Lordsburg </LOCATION> wants new jobs, tourists and its businesses to grow. But promoters never dreamed the hottest development deal here in decades would involve a Manhattan-size landfill that has thrown the town into the debate over the nation's mounting solid waste problem. Immense, isolated and sparsely populated, the <LOCATION> Hidalgo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> desert near <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> has been chosen by a <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> company for the commercial landfill. The dump would accommodate up to 20,000 tons of garbage a day from <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> cities. The proposal was not exactly a secret. A major construction firm, <ORGANIZATION> Driggs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Heights </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, acting locally as Innovative Environmental Systems of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, had secured property in the area and in January asked the state for a landfill permit. But elected officials and their constituents _ caught off guard when news of the proposal surfaced _ sent a shock wave of opposition that has since reverberated in every <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> town and county as well as the Capitol in <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fe </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, mayor of this southwestern <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> town of 3,200 people, recalls that January morning when he saw a map of his town on the front page of a newspaper: `` There's <LOCATION> Lordsburg </LOCATION> on the map right there, and <PERSON> Driggs </PERSON>, and I looked at my wife and said, ` What is this?' My phone started ringing, ` What is this? What is this?''' The 7,300-acre landfill site would sit on 36 square miles now occupied by lizards, snakes, mesquite brush and yucca. The property is neatly and conveniently bisected by Interstate 10 and the busy <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Railroad </ORGANIZATION> line. The opposition moved fast, turning trash into a major environmental-political issue in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and focusing attention on the state's inadequate landfill regulations and the national quest for suitable landfill space. When the 1989 Legislature convened in mid-January, a bill was introduced to toughen the landfill law and block commercial dumps. It received overwhelming support. But the bill was vetoed by Gov. <PERSON> Garrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Carruthers </PERSON>, who cited technicalities that he said would have forced the immediate closure of every landfill in the state. But in March, <PERSON> Carruthers </PERSON> issued a moratorium outlawing all new commercial landfills except under special circumstances. The state <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Improvement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> adopted new regulations two months later. <LOCATION> Hidalgo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, responding to the public demand, also imposed a landfill moratorium and initiated its first-ever land use planning effort. `` Now that we are aware ... that they are looking at deserts for landfills, we need to protect ourselves,'' said County Commissioner <PERSON> Maura </PERSON> <PERSON> Rico </PERSON>. <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanchez </PERSON>, <PERSON> Driggs </PERSON>' director of special projects who was the company's local representative, and <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Golden </PERSON>, executive vice president, refused to be interviewed by The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, citing fears of adverse publicity. However, <ORGANIZATION> Innovative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION>' director, I.M. `` Ike'' <PERSON> Smalley </PERSON>, who retired last year from the state <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> after 38 years, said <LOCATION> Lordsburg </LOCATION> residents never waited for a full explanation, leading to misconceptions about the landfill and its potential benefits. <LOCATION> Lordsburg </LOCATION> would reap economic benefits, including up to 150 jobs and a $ 3 million payroll. Few residents are tempted. `` My first reaction was that no waste disposal operation of this size could possibly be a good thing for the community ... no matter how many jobs it creates,'' said <PERSON> Charlie </PERSON> <PERSON> Hayes </PERSON>, a school administrator and leader of the opposition. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> also said he worries that <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> could get a reputation as the nation's dump, a status some have conferred because of the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant, the nation's low - and intermediate-level nuclear waste repository near <LOCATION> Carlsbad </LOCATION> And he fears what the landfill would mean to <LOCATION> Lordsburg </LOCATION>'s image with tourists. `` People will come in and say, ` Children, we're coming into <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> now. This is where the world's largest dump is.'''

 `` Batman'' made more money in three days than most movies generate in their lifetimes, with a $ 42.7 million opening that broke a week-old record and drove the industry to a record $ 90 million-plus weekend. Despite attracting less-than-overwhelming reviews, `` Batman,'' starring <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Keaton </PERSON> in the title role and <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Nicholson </PERSON> as the Joker, set new marks for the best opening day with $ 15.3 million Friday, according to figures released Monday. It also recorded the biggest Saturday at $ 14.6 million and Sunday at $ 12.7 million in movie history. Those figures were rounded off; the exact figures yielded the $ 42.7 million gross, according to <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Krier </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Exhibitor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, which tracks box-office performance. The previous opening-weekend record was set a week earlier by `` Ghostbusters II,'' which grossed $ 29.5 million. Overall, American and Canadian movie fans spent more than $ 95 million at theaters during the weekend, breaking yet another record by $ 3 million. `` This is tremendous. It is the biggest weekend ever in the history of the business,'' said <PERSON> Krier </PERSON>. This summer's box office is now running 14 percent ahead of last year's record season of $ 1.7 billion, according to industry estimates. Grosses have been boosted by higher ticket prices, up to $ 7 in some theaters. The unprecedented popularity of <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bros. </ORGANIZATION>' `` Batman'' may even have helped the competition, as moviegoers _ perhaps frustrated by unbearably long `` Batman'' lines at some of its 2,194 screens _ dashed to <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION>'s modest comedy, `` Honey, I Shrunk the Kids,'' in record numbers. `` Honey,'' which is being shown with a new 7 -LCB- - minute <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabbit </PERSON> cartoon called `` Tummy Trouble,'' collected $ 14.3 million in its first weekend to finish in second place It broke all of Disney's opening box-office records, including those set by its hits `` Cocktail'' and `` Three Men and a Baby. The Disney production enjoyed the third-best opening weekend of any non-sequel movie, trailing only `` Batman'' and `` <LOCATION> Beverly </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION> Cop,'' the studio said. The most noticeable victim of the `` Batman'' and `` Honey, I Shrunk the Kids'' onslaught was <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Ghostbusters II,'' with <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Murray </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Aykroyd </PERSON>, which fell sharply after its record opening. Finishing third on the box-office charts, `` Ghostbusters II'' grossed $ 13.9 million, a collapse of more than 52 percent. In fourth place was <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Indiana <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> and the Last Crusade,'' which grossed $ 8.2 million. It was followed in fifth place by <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Dead Poets Society,'' $ 7.3 million, featuring <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> as a crusading high-school teacher. `` We are so excited about that picture,'' said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Cook </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION>'s president of distribution. `` With ` <PERSON> Indiana </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>,' ` Star Trek,' ` Ghostbusters' and ` Batman,' to have this movie performing at the level that it is ... It's going to be around for a long, long time.'' In sixth was `` Star Trek V: The Final Frontier,'' the <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Shatner-directed </PERSON> sequel that seems overwhelmed by the summer competition. After opening strongly two weeks ago, `` Star Trek V'' grossed only $ 3.7 million over the weekend. Universal's baseball movie `` Field of Dreams,'' with <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Costner </PERSON>, landed in seventh with ticket sales of $ 2.1 million. In eighth was the comedy `` See No Evil, Hear No Evil,'' with estimated grosses of $ 1.6 million. Rounding out the Top 10 were `` Road House'' with $ 913,000 and `` No Holds Barred'' with $ 808,000. Here are the top movies for the weekend as tallied by Exhibitor Relations, with distributor, weekend gross, number of theater screens, average per screen, total gross and number of weeks in release. 1. `` Batman,'' <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bros. </ORGANIZATION>, $ 42.7 million, 2,194 screens, $ 19,465 per screen, $ 42.7 million, one week. 2. `` Honey, I Shrunk the Kids,'' <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION>, $ 14.3 million, 1,371 screens, $ 10,403 per screen, $ 14.3 million, one week. 3. `` Ghostbusters II,'' <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION>, $ 13.9 million, 2,410 screens, $ 5,749 per screen, $ 58.8 million, two weeks. 4. `` Indiana <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> and the Last Crusade,'' Paramount, $ 8.2 million, 2,103 screens, $ 3,881 per screen, $ 136.3 million, five weeks. 5. `` Dead Poets Society,'' <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION>, $ 7.3 million, 1,091 screens, $ 6,732 per screen, $ 35.6 million, four weeks. 6. `` Star Trek V: The Final Frontier,'' Paramount, $ 3.7 million, 2,007 screens, $ 1,866 per screen, $ 38.3 million, three weeks. 7. `` Field of Dreams,'' Universal, $ 2.1 million, 995 screens, $ 2,135 per screen, $ 47.7 million, 10 weeks. 8. `` See No Evil, Hear No Evil,'' Tri-Star, $ 1.6 million, 1,465 screens, $ 1,085 per screen, $ 41 million, seven weeks. 9. `` Road House,'' <ORGANIZATION> MGM-UA </ORGANIZATION>, $ 913,093, 1,051 screens, $ 869 per screen, $ 25.7 million, six weeks. 10. `` No Holds Barred,'' New Line, $ 808,594, 1,005 screens, $ 805 per screen, $ 13.9 million, four weeks.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> faces some $ 650 million in loan defaults from nine mortgage companies whose practices now are under review, a spokesman said Monday. Three of the nine companies have been suspended indefinitely from doing business with the department, three others have been placed on probation for six months and three more face examination of their projects, <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> documents show. In addition, <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Keating </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> general counsel-designate, said escrow agent <PERSON> Marilyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Harrell </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and agents in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> became the first agents that <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> would bar from future government contracts, <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> said in Tuesday editions. The cases are part of a nationwide investigation of <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION>' dealings with about 280 closing agents who handled government foreclosures. Ms. <PERSON> Harrell </PERSON>, whose diversion of $ 5.5 million from the government's primary housing subsidy program earned her the nickname `` <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> HUD </PERSON>,'' turned over her house to the department to cover part of the thefts and moved out on Monday. The mortgage companies have been involved in `` coinsurance programs'' at <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION>, under which they earn lucrative fees for servicing loans for federally backed housing programs but stand to lose little if the borrower defaults. The mortgage companies have to absorb the first 5 percent of the loss on the loans, but <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> takes 85 prcent of the remaining loss. `` Lenders were underwriting unsound loans, overmortgaging properties, failing to detect indications of troubled loans in a timely manner, and were not taking adequate and timely actions to minimize mortgage defaults and coinsurance losses,'' according to a <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> inspector general's report issued earlier this year. That report estimated that loans worth some $ 700 million were in default, but <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Glavin </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, said some of the potential losses have been recovered, lowering the overall liability to $ 650 million. That represents about 13 percent of the money loaned under the program, he said.

At the beginning of May <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> placed a moratorium on the entire coinsurance program until Sept. 1 while the agency reviews the program. To preempt a federal eviction, Ms. <PERSON> Harrell </PERSON>, 46, spent the weekend hauling six truckloads of furniture from the house she purchased with her own money in 1986, including a white baby grand piano and a large-screen television set. She moved in with her mother nearby. Ms. <PERSON> Harrell </PERSON> said she gave <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> the title to her home in December when her contract as a closing agent for <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> ran out and agents were asking about millions missing from her title company. She said she also had transferred to <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> the deeds to five other houses she paid for with <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION>'s money and used for various charities and homeless families. Last week, Ms. <PERSON> Harrell </PERSON> said two vans and a pickup truck used by her company were seized at her business office in <PERSON> Clinton </PERSON>, Md.

<HEAD>Death Penalty Opponents Outraged by Court Ruling on Children</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Death penalty opponents are calling for new state laws to protect juveniles and the mentally retarded in the wake of <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> rulings they say are `` medieval and barbaric.'' `` To give up, with ultimate finality, upon a person even before they emerge from childhood ... is squarely in opposition to the fundamental premises of an enlightened juvenile justice system,'' said <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Raven </PERSON>. `` We strongly urge states to enact legislation which recognizes that minors ... should not be held to ... the ultimate sanction of death,'' he said. Of the 37 states permitting capital punishment, 15 now bar its use for anyone who committed the crime before age 18. The court, voting 5-4, said Monday the Constitution does not bar states from executing murderers who committed their crimes as young as 16 or mentally retarded adult killers. In the case of the mentally retarded, the justices said convicted murderers may demand that sentencing juries and judges consider their limited reasoning capacity as a factor weighing against the death penalty. The court upheld the death sentences of a <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> murderer who was 17 when he killed, a <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> killer who was 16, and a <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> killer who has the mental capacity of a 7-year-old. Last year, the court decided that 15 was too young for execution. The justices, expected to wrap up the current court term on Thursday, have yet to issue a decision in a closely watched <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> case in which the court's 1973 decision legalizing abortion is under attack. The court must either announce a decision or schedule the case to be argued again during its next term beginning in October. In other matters Monday, the court: _ Ruled, 7-2, that skyrocketing punitive damage awards in personal injury lawsuits do not violate the Constitution's ban on excessive fines The decision left open the possibility that such hefty awards violate due-process rights. _ Said police may stray from the precise wording of the famous Miranda warnings given to criminal suspects, voting 5-4 to reinstate an <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> man's conviction for attempted murder _ Unanimously interpreted a key federal anti-racketeering law broadly in a <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> case to make it easier to use the law in civil lawsuits against businesses accused of fraud _ Agreed to decide in an <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> case whether states may outlaw possession of `` lewd'' photographs and films depicting child nudity The court in 1982 said states could ban the promotion and distribution of such material, but stopped short of allowing its possession to be a crime. Law enforcement authorities said the juvenile death penalty decisions will advance the fight against violent crime. `` In an era of growing concern over the increase and seriousness of violent crime, the court's decision ... reaffirms that state legislators, the juvenile justice system and local juries _ not the federal courts _ can and should decide upon the proper age to impose the death penalty,'' said Attorney General <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Cowan </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>. `` Clearly, some 16 - and 17-year-olds in our society are fully mature and capable of plotting and carrying out the most heinous of crimes,'' he added `` The court has obviously responded to society's demand to hold youths who are mature enough to commit horrible crimes responsible for their actions. The court's juvenile-killers ruling affects about 25 of the 2,200 death row inmates across the nation. As for mental retardation, people who function at below-average intelligence comprise between 12 and 30 percent of all death row inmates, according to one group opposed to the death penalty. The rulings prompted widespread concern among activists for individual rights. `` It is quite appalling that the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> would read the Constitution ... as not banning the execution of children,'' said <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Schwarzschild </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>. `` To let the society hang children is medieval and barbaric.'' <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Ellis </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Retardation </ORGANIZATION>, said, `` It now falls to state legislatures to assure that no individual with this disability is ever put to death in this country. The execution of any such person would represent a tragic injustice.'' <PERSON> Michele </PERSON> <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Missouri </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Against </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Death </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Penalty </ORGANIZATION> said the rulings give states `` rein to execute children.'' But Missouri Attorney General <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Webster </PERSON> said the rulings will not prompt more executions of minors. `` I think that's hogwash. There's a lot of people that say it's going to open the door That's ludicrous,'' he said.

<TEXT>
 Former House Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> says he's leaving <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> for good on Friday, ending speculation that he might seek re-election to the seat that ethics charges forced him to give up <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> issued a statement saying he is gratified by supporters' calls for him to seek re-election _ and political vindication _ in a special vote to be called after he steps down `` As deeply as I appreciate the devoted friendship which impels these sincere petitions, I must conclude that I was right in announcing my retirement from <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>,'' the <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, Democrat said Monday. `` It is best for the institution and best for the people whom I've served that I step aside now and make room for others,'' he said. He said his nearly 35-year <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> career will end Friday and he will not seek elective office again. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> ethics committee had charged <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> with 69 violations, involving whether he sidestepped <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> limits on outside income through bulk sales of a book he wrote, and whether he improperly accepted $ 145,000 in gifts from a business partner with a direct interest in legislation. In an emotional speech to the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> on May 31, <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said he would step down as speaker and resign his <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> seat by the end of June. He was replaced as speaker by Rep. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>, D-Wash., a week later But <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> had left open the possibility he might seek re-election to the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> in an attempt to counter the ethics charges that made him the first <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> speaker ever to resign under fire. He said last week he might run if there were `` an absolutely genuine draft of a bipartisan nature.'' In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, however, colleagues were privately aghast at the suggestion he might seek to stay on. An aide, speaking on condition of anonymity, said a weekend poll showing home-district support for <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> figured prominently in the decision not to run again. `` He just felt like that was vindication,'' the aide said. Sixty-five percent of <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s constituents who were polled said they would vote for him again. About 81 percent believed <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> was doing an `` outstanding'' or `` good'' job in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and 67 percent said he gave up too soon in his fight against the ethics charges. The poll, which sampled 407 residents last week and had an error margin of plus or minus 5 percentage points, appeared in Sunday's <ORGANIZATION> Fort </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Worth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Star-Telegram </ORGANIZATION> `` To seek and gain the splendid honor of a public endorsement one more time would be vainglorious,'' <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said in the statement. `` To do so without intending to serve for a prolonged period would be pointless. To postpone the moment when another may begin would be a disservice.'' Had he run again and won, <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> still could have been subject to disciplinary action by the ethics committee, which apparently decided to set the case aside after he announced his intention to resign. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said he has accepted `` five or six'' invitations to deliver speeches and is considering `` some limited business and professional relationships'' and writing opportunities. He will maintain an office in <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION>, he said. He and his wife, <PERSON> Betty </PERSON>, plan to attend a `` Welcome Home, <PERSON> Jim </PERSON>'' celebration Thursday in <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION>, sponsored by Mayor <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Bolen </PERSON> and former Rep. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Vandergriff </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Foreign Press Uses Imaginative Tactics to Report Crisis</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP Extra</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Covering the news in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> under the growing obstacles created by martial law requires more in the way of imaginative tactics by foreign journalists than derring-do. Reporting on <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s political crisis has become increasingly difficult as soldiers and police strictly enforce restrictions on the press. Newsgathering is basically banned under martial law, except for the infrequent government-orchestrated peasant rally or news conference. But virtually all reporters in the capital and other <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> cities ignore the regulations, coming up with their own ways of getting around martial law. `` The most effective trick these days is to act like a dumb tourist,'' says an Asian photojournalist. `` Wear bright clothes and shorts, and do n't hide your camera.'' If stopped by security personnel, he says, `` the best defense is to go on the offense. Ask them some questions. It's better than trying to run away.'' Martial law was imposed May 20 in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> in a move to quell the student-led democracy movement that was finally crushed June 4 when soldiers killed hundreds of unarmed civilians in the capital. Under the vaguely worded decree, foreigners are prohibited from entering or taking pictures at schools, factories or `` organizations''. Television networks face the greatest difficulties. Their equipment makes them easy to spot. `` For television, we do n't have a story unless we have a picture that can convey the information,'' says a CBS News official. `` We get chased away all the time. We're very frustrated at not being able to shoot pictures.'' Coverage has been reduced to relying on government-controlled TV news. `` A great deal of what we're doing is recording their material and reworking it,'' said the <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> official. `` We're very much at their mercy.'' Foreign television networks can no longer send segments through state-run <ORGANIZATION> China </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> to <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> via satellite. They must now somehow get their videotapes to <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>. `` We smuggled out our tapes, did the double shuffle with the cassettes and that sort,'' said <PERSON> Vernon </PERSON> <PERSON> Mann </PERSON>, a correspondent for <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Independent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION> whose videotape was `` confiscated'' by police after he filmed on a university campus in <LOCATION> Chengdu </LOCATION>, central <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. `` Our piece, which would have greatly upset them, was aired all over the <LOCATION> U.K. </LOCATION> -LRB- <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kingdom </LOCATION> -RRB-.'' <PERSON> Mann </PERSON> was expelled from <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> for the incident. Still photographers have an easier time. One wrapped his camera in a jacket and put the bundle in his bicycle basket, shooting frames as he passed soldiers guarding intersections. Another put aside his complex single-lens reflex camera and instead went out with the automatic-focus variety so all he had to do was point and push. Most photographers have resorted to taking pictures from cars, some with darkened windows, as they zip past soldiers on patrol or troops checking identification. One cameraman from a European photo agency took a dramatic shot through the back window of a taxi of a man in handcuffs being led away by soldiers. `` One guy saw me, and I just hit my driver on the back and said, ` Let's get out of here!,''' he said. Print journalists face more subtle difficulties. With most Chinese frightened into silence by widespread arrests, including the nationally publicized arrest of a man who talked to an American television crew, reporters' sources are drying up. `` I've simply stopped telephoning people,'' said one <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> reporter, noting that he and most colleagues assume their phones are tapped. `` I think of my Chinese contacts first and foremost as friends and I've stopped making any attempt to contact them.'' Other journalists discover that acquaintances refuse to meet them. A German reporter was turned away when he showed up at the doorsteps of some Chinese friends. He says now he does not even take notes on the streets, preferring to keep his eyes open and later write down what he saw. The few who do make appointments do so with great caution, calling from public telephones, instructing friends not to say their names in phone conversations, making appointments by prearranged code and meeting sources furtively in discrete locations. `` I only move around at night,'' said a Japanese reporter. `` Even though it's easier for me to blend into a crowd than Westerners, I still stand out.'' He says while many people who have helped him have gone underground, he has n't stopped seeing people because `` Chinese have information you ca n't get otherwise.'' He, too, says meetings are much harder to arrange. `` You ca n't meet people in hotels _ they have secret cameras everywhere,'' referring to footage taken by a hidden camera of a student leader feasting at the <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> Hotel Now he finds the only place he can interview people is in his car _ during the day, when soldiers are n't checking vehicles for fugitives. `` The greatest danger in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> now is that the people have lost their voice,'' he said. `` The reformists and intellectuals are all gone. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> have lost its good-heartedness.''

<TEXT>
 The strongest earthquake to hit <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> in six years shook a sparsely populated area of <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> already ravaged by lava, destroying two homes and generating a small tidal wave. No serious injuries were reported. Authorities were investigating reports of damage to other homes Monday, said <ORGANIZATION> Hawaii </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Administrator <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Kim </PERSON>. `` Our first priority this morning is to check certain remote areas to make sure no one is trapped in their homes,'' <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> said. `` Early reports we are getting indicate no one is trapped.'' The temblor, caused by the 6 -LCB- - year-old eruption of <LOCATION> Kilauea </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Volcano </LOCATION>, struck Sunday evening and measured 6.1 on the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Geological Survey said It was centered west of <LOCATION> Kalapana </LOCATION>, a small coastal town on the south flank of the volcano, said <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Turner </PERSON>, a geophysicist at the <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tsunami </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Warning </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION>. The quake was triggered by the release of pressure generated by the movement of underground magma, or molten rock, said <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Koyanagi </PERSON>, a seismic analyst at the <ORGANIZATION> Geological </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Survey </ORGANIZATION>'s Hawaiian Volcano Observatory. <PERSON> Reggie </PERSON> <PERSON> Okamura </PERSON>, a spokesman for the observatory, said scientists had recorded numerous aftershocks. The strongest, measuring 4.0 on the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale, was recorded Sunday night, he said. <LOCATION> Kilauea </LOCATION> lava has destroyed 68 homes in the <LOCATION> Kalapana </LOCATION> area since its latest eruption began Jan. 3, 1983. Four homes were destroyed in May, and last Thursday a <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> Volcanoes National Park visitor center burst into flames as lava crept beneath the wooden structure. <PERSON> Koyanagi </PERSON> said pressure became too great within the world's most active volcano, causing its south flank to move and triggering the earthquake. The tidal wave, which measured 22.8 inches high at <LOCATION> Honuapo </LOCATION>, 8.4 inches at <LOCATION> Kapoho </LOCATION> and 5.6 inches at <LOCATION> Hilo </LOCATION>, caused no damage, <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> said. Five people were injured by falling debris inside homes, but none required hospitalization, <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> said. Crews were working to repair downed power lines. It was the strongest earthquake to hit the state since Nov. 15, 1983, when a 6.6 temblor caused several million dollars damage on <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>. The <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on seismographs. Every increase of one number means a tenfold increase in magnitude.

<HEAD>Latest Oil Spills Far Different From Alaskan Disaster</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BRISCOE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Major oil spills in <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> provided a big challenge for the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> but the tasks differed sharply from the massive <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> spill that is still being cleaned up three months after it happened. `` Here we have a spill that we hoped would n't happen, but we were prepared for it,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Rick </PERSON> <PERSON> Meidt </PERSON>, who worked on both the Alaskan spill and the spill last Friday at the mouth of <LOCATION> Narragansett </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> off <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>. `` Up there in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, it was a spill that could n't happen, but it did, `` he said. The same pumps used to evacuate 40 million gallons of Alaskan crude from the Exxon Valdez after it ran aground March 24 in <LOCATION> Prince </LOCATION> <LOCATION> William </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sound </LOCATION> and spilled more than 10 million gallons were being used on the World Prodigy in <LOCATION> Naragansett </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>. But they were pumping a far different substance. While the Alaskan crude continues to pollute shorelines as far as 450 miles away from the original spill, the 420,000 gallons of refined heating oil that poured out of the World Prodigy have largely evaporated or dissipated. On the <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, cleanup crews were contending with yet a different consistency: basketball-sized globs of oil from 800,000 gallons that oozed out of a Uraguayan tanker Saturday. But that was also easier to clean up than the Alaskan crude. <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> officials said shoreline damage downriver in <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> was almost nonexistent because the oil was thick and was not washing up on the shore. In <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, by contrast, the soft crude seeped deep into beach sand. In the <LOCATION> Galveston </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> outside <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>, 250,000 gallons of oil that spilled in the collision of a tanker and a barge was confined to a small shipping channel and most of the oil that washed ashore affected only industrial property. Weather conditions after both the Alaskan and the recent weekend spills were mild, but brought far different results. Off the <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION>, the sun speeded up evaporation of the light oil off the <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION>. `` In <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, what we needed was a storm to break up the oil,'' said <PERSON> Meidt </PERSON>. He said booms also were used quickly and effectively in the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> spill to contain and divert the oil in a way that was never possible after <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>'s midnight spill 25 miles out in <LOCATION> Prince </LOCATION> <LOCATION> William </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sound </LOCATION>. `` This one was literally in the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION>'s backyard,'' said <PERSON> Meidt </PERSON>. `` We just went out and put a boom around it.'' Officials said a response system being reviewed as a result of the Alaskan spill appears to be working well in handling the smaller spills. But officials still need to know how the response system would work with a much larger spill. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Pascoe </PERSON>, chief of the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION>'s environmental response branch, said that response of officials may have been heightened over the weekend because of the reviews they are conducting, but he said there have been no policy or operational changes since the Alaskan spill. No equipment or personnel had to be moved from <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> for the latest spills, he said. The workload is also being handled differently. <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> is paying thousands of workers to clean up oil in the Alaskan spill. Private contractors, volunteers, <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guardsmen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> personnel are involved in cleaning up the latest spills, but shippers have to pay the costs. In each of the latest spills, local <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> officials were overseeing the cleanup, said <PERSON> Pascoe </PERSON>. He said it was too early for the Alaskan spill to have much impact on the way the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> or other agencies respond to spills. But he noted <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> is considering several measures to deal with spills in the wake of the Alaskan disaster. The oil industry last week announced its own plans for a cooperative response.

<HEAD>Companies Fined for Failure to Report Toxic Chemical Releases</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Scores of companies face nearly $ 4 million in fines because they did not report toxic chemical releases under a citizens' right-to-know law that took effect last year, says the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> announced its latest enforcement action Monday against companies that failed to comply with the law, saying that $ 1.65 million in fines were placed against 42 companies in 20 states. The agency previously took action against 43 other companies. <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> Administrator <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Reilly </PERSON> said the agency will continue to pursue civil penalties against companies that do not comply with the disclosure law. `` We will not allow non-reporting companies to thwart the right of citizens to find out which toxic chemicals are being released into their communities,'' said <PERSON> Reilly </PERSON> in a statement. The penalties announced Monday ranged from $ 5,000 to a high of $ 262,000 against a <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> electronics firm, <ORGANIZATION> Diceon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electronics </ORGANIZATION>, which allegedly failed to report toxic chemical releases at facilities in <LOCATION> Irvine </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Chatsworth </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif </LOCATION>. The second highest fine was against <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Extrusion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Waxalachie </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, which was assessed a $ 101,000 penalty. Officials from the two companies could not be reached for comment Monday. Nearly 20,000 companies nationwide filed the chemical release disclosure reports, which covered 1987, before the filing deadline last July. The statistics recently provided the first detailed glimpse into the volume of toxic chemicals that are being released into the air, water and soil by industry each year. But the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> has estimated that about 20 percent of the businesses subject to the disclosure requirement may not have complied with the law during the first reporting period. The second round of reports covering releases in 1988 are due to be filed at the end of this month. In addition to seeking fines from the 85 companies, the agency has filed formal notices of noncompliance against more than 1,500 other companies, although no civil penalties in those cases have yet been sought. <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Luke </PERSON> <PERSON> Hester </PERSON> said the amount of the fine proposed against any single company depended on the size of the business, total quantity of a chemical not reported and quantities manufactured. Failure to report chemical releases can result in civil penalties of up to $ 25,000 a day. The companies may appeal the proposed civil penalties and request a formal hearing. The other companies fined in the latest enforcement action were: <ORGANIZATION> Eyelematic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Watertown </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION> -LRB- $ 59,000 -RRB-; <PERSON> Allen </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Providence </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> R.I. </LOCATION> -LRB- $ 5,000 -RRB-; <ORGANIZATION> Nyman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Providence </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> R.I. </LOCATION> -LRB- $ 17,000 -RRB-;

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, welcoming five dozen state and local officials into the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION>, says the political converts are just part of the `` droves of voters'' being shut out by a left-leaning <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who often extols the virtues of bipartisanship in dealing with <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, reached back for some campaign-style rhetoric Monday at the White House event where the Republicans paraded the party-switchers. `` The Democratic party is leaving droves of voters behind as it moves over onto the more liberal side, the left side of the political equation. And now many of those stranded voters have made a move on their own to the Republican party, our party of family, faith and the future,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had a different sort of White House ceremony on tap today with plans to greet Australian Prime Minister <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Hawke </PERSON> with full military honors followed by a private meeting and, in the evening, a state dinner. The emphasis was on politics Monday when the ex-Democrats trekked through the Oval Office to pose for official pictures with the president and hear their praises sung in the Rose Garden by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, GOP Chairman <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> and Rep. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Grant </PERSON> <PERSON> of </PERSON> <PERSON> Perry </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, who made his own switch to the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> in February. `` You're tough,'' <PERSON> Grant </PERSON> told the state representatives, judges, sheriffs, mayors and other officials. At home, he said, `` you're being accused of being a traitor, turncoat, accused of betraying the voters by leaving the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> praised their political courage and promised to stand `` shoulder to shoulder'' with them as they seek re-election as Republicans. `` The switch is on to the party in sync with the American principles. The switch is on to the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>,'' said the president. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, employing the rhetoric he successfully used to hammer Democrat <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> in the presidential campaign, said Republicans were moving `` in the right direction.'' The Democrats are `` on the move, too, to the left and out of the mainstream,'' he said. <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON>, embroiled in controversy recently over a <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> attack on new House Speaker <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>, called the event `` absolutely the proudest single moment I've had since taking office.'' He said the new Republicans were just part of 118 elected officials who have switched to the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> `` since my chairmanship began'' in January. `` And I know of no single example of a Republican party official ... who has switched the other way,'' he said. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Evers </PERSON>, outgoing mayor of <LOCATION> Fayette </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Miss. </LOCATION>, and brother of slain civil rights leader <PERSON> Medgar </PERSON> <PERSON> Evers </PERSON>, said he switched parties because `` I do n't like to be with losers. The <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> is a loser.'' <PERSON> Evers </PERSON> added that he did n't want to see an all-white <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. He said he will try to encourage black voters in <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> to register Republican because blacks are better off with representation in both parties. <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON>, an <LOCATION> Allenhurst </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, dentist and environmental activist running for the state assembly, was one of only a few politicians from north of the Mason-Dixon line identified among the new Republicans. He said he changed parties because of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s promise to `` make ending ocean pollution a priority in his administration.''

 First Lady <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is springing to the defense of her spaniel <PERSON> Millie </PERSON>, branded `` ugly'' by Washingtonian magazine. The monthly gave <PERSON> Millie </PERSON> the dubious distinction of being the `` best'' ugly dog in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> in an offbeat ranking of bests-and-worsts in the nation's capital. It said the White House `` mutt'' has not bitten the president yet, `` but let's face it: This is a very homely springer spaniel.'' `` <PERSON> Millie </PERSON> has been slow about writing her book, but this is going to bring her to action,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told reporters outside the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> on Monday night after returning with President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> from a parade at the Marine Barracks. Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> ghost wrote an autobiography titled `` C. Fred's Story'' of her previous dog to raise funds for charity.

<HEAD>FDA Makes New Drugs Available to AIDS Patients</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH MESCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Though medical science still has no cure for AIDS, federal health officials say new therapies and greater access to experimental drugs are extending and improving the quality of life of AIDS patients. They say this is more reason than ever for people to be tested for AIDS. `` A few years ago, the diagnosis was a death sentence,'' <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON>, commissioner of the <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, told reporters Monday in announcing <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> action on two drugs for AIDS-related conditions. `` Now there's significant hope'' to prolong life by warding off the infections that invade the weakened immune systems of AIDS victims, he said. `` The good news is that there are more therapies that are coming to treat the disease early.'' Commercial approval was granted for the drug ganciclovir for treatment of an eye infection that can lead to blindness in AIDS patients. About one in every four AIDS patients gets cytomegalovirus retinitis. The <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> also is allowing expanded pre-market distribution of an experimental protien, r-erythropoietin, to treat severe anemia that weakens nearly half of the 20,000 patients taking the AIDS-fighting drug AZT. Earlier this month, the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> approved aerosol pentamidine to prevent pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, which kills about 60 percent of AIDS victims. `` These are important advances, but the disease still remains demonic,'' <PERSON> Young </PERSON> said. Though there is still no cure or vaccine, `` people need to know as early as possible what the diagnosis is so they can get the proper care.'' The <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION>, criticized by AIDS advocates for moving too slowly in getting promising drugs to patients, has been moving the approval process more quickly while still assuring that experimental drugs are safe. Using a special treatment category formally instituted two years ago, the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> allows pre-market distribution of a drug that has been shown to be safe and may be effective. With this status, called `` treatment investigational new drug,'' or treatment IND, a drug can be distributed more widely while research on its effectiveness continues. <PERSON> Young </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> has also been working with the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institutes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> to develop another avenue designed to give more AIDS patients access to experimental drugs. This system would allow experimental drugs to be distributed to AIDS patients who do not fit the criteria demanded for a clinical trial. Young said it could allow access to drugs several months earlier than a treatment IND, he said. More than 100 drugs are being investigated for treatment of acquired immune deficiency syndrome and AIDS-related conditions, he said. So far, four have been approved, but only one _ zidovudine, or AZT _ is aimed at stemming the AIDS viral infection itself. The other three _ ganciclovir, aerosol pentamidine and alpha interferon _ are used to treat AIDS-related conditions. The <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> said that though studies have shown ganciclovir to be effective in retarding the sight-threatening infection, extensive post-marketing studies are needed to determine whether patients on AZT can also take ganciclovir. Both drugs are highly toxic. <ORGANIZATION> Syntex </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Palo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Alto </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, will market ganciclovir under the trade name Cytovene. R-erythropoietin is one of more than a dozen drugs with treatment IND status, and the fifth AIDS-related drug to have reached this category. <ORGANIZATION> Ortho </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pharmaceutical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Raritan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, is sponsoring the drug and will make it available free to patients while the studies continue.

<HEAD>Tanker Accidents Raise Political Heat on Oil Industry</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BURNS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> WASHINGTON </LOCATION> _ The latest oil shipping accidents in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> waters are raising the likelihood <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> will widen restrictions on drilling in promising areas off the shores of <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and other states, oil industry analysts and lawmakers say. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appropriations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> is to consider Wednesday a bill containing tough limits on oil development in the <LOCATION> Bristol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> area of the southern <LOCATION> Bering </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> and in federally controlled waters off <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Keys </LOCATION>. Rep. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Pallone </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.J. </LOCATION>, predicted Monday the legislation will pass the full <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> this session, in part because of publicity about oil spills over the weekend in the <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>'s ship channel and near <LOCATION> Newport </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> R.I. </LOCATION> `` They just point out how delicate the near-shore environment is,'' <PERSON> Pallone </PERSON> said in an interview. He wrote letters to several major oil companies earlier this month asking them not to bid for federal lease sales off the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> coast. Presidential press secretary <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said Monday the latest spills show the `` pervasiveness of the problem'' but do n't require new steps by President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> such as initiatives to limit oil exploration The latest spills were a significant blow to the oil industry, which is still reeling from the devastating Exxon Valdez oil spill March 24 in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>'s Prince <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sound </PERSON>. That accident, the worst spill in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> history, almost immediately killed chances for congressional approval of legislation to open the <ORGANIZATION> Arctic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Refuge </ORGANIZATION>, on <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>'s North Slope, to oil and natural gas exploration. A further consequence of the recent tanker accidents _ and public criticism of the industry's cleanup response _ may be a new ban on exploration in <LOCATION> Bristol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>, a rich fishing area <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>'s state government says is more vulnerable to spill damage than Prince <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sound </PERSON>. `` They'll stop <LOCATION> Bristol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>'' exploration, <PERSON> Dillard </PERSON> <PERSON> Spriggs </PERSON>, president of the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> consulting company <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Analysis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>, said Monday. `` It's going to be hard to explore very much in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>'' until the industry improves its public image. Although most of the Capitol Hill focus on offshore oil exploration has been limited to <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, movements to ban or slow down drilling have emerged in <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>. The oil industry, long aware of political pressures to limit offshore drilling, until recently sought to rely on its past safety record and assertions that less domestic drilling will mean more <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> reliance on foreign suppliers. But since the Valdez accident exposed the industry's inability to handle large-scale spills, oil companies have tried to take the offensive by promising to devote more money, personnel and equipment to responding to major accidents. The latest spills came just days after a special task force of oil executives announced plans to spend $ 250 million over five years to create a nationwide network of cleanup equipment and workers to handle a major spill on any coastal waterway. The cleanup system is not expected to be working until next summer. The <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, representing the major oil companies, gave a muted response to the weekend spills. It said although its proposed regional response centers will be designed to handle worse disasters, the centers could have been called into action by the government if they had been in place. The industry counters anti-drilling arguments by noting that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dependence on foreign oil has risen sharply in recent years. Imported oil makes up about 45 percent of total <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> supplies and the foreign share is expected to grow unless major oil fields are discovered on federal land. The industry and the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration say such reliance on foreign suppliers undermines <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> energy security and means more environmental risk from foreign tanker traffic. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is awaiting the recommendations of a task force he assembled in March to review potential environment damage from oil and natural gas drilling in federal waters off northern and southern <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and the southern Gulf coast of <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. The group is to report by Jan. 1.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Interest rates on short-term <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> securities are at their lowest level in more than six months. The <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> on Monday sold $ 6.4 billion in three-month bills at an average discount rate of 8.07 percent, down from 8.22 percent last week. Another $ 6.4 billion was sold in six-month bills at an average discount rate of 7.78 percent, down from 8.08 percent last week. The rates were the lowest since three-month bills sold for 7.98 percent last Dec. 12 and six-month bills averaged 7.71 percent last Nov. 7. The discount rates understate the actual return to investors _ 8.35 percent for three-month bills with a $ 10,000 bill selling for $ 9,796.00 and 8.21 percent for a six-month bill selling for $ 9,606.70. In a separate report, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> said Monday the average yield for one-year <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bills, the most popular index for making changes in adjustable-rate mortgages, rose to 8.53 percent last week, up from 8.45 percent the previous week.

 Abuse and mismanagement may be everywhere in the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION>, say investigators who confess they do n't know where their probe will be headed next. `` We have made the assumption that there is a problem within every unit within <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION>, and until we learn that there is n't, we're going to assume that there is,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Shays </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Conn </LOCATION>., a member of the congressional panel investigating the So far, the investigations have roamed from one unrelated program to the next and have been shotgunned from one part of the nation to another. A sampling from around the country: _ In <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Norton </PERSON> says his office is investigating allegations that a suspended <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> accountant embezzled some $ 1 million in housing funds _ In <LOCATION> Indianapolis </LOCATION>, auditors are trying to account for $ 176,965 arising from 11 property sales _ In <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, a pair of real estate brokers are awaiting trial on charges of defrauding <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> of more than $ 900,000 _ In <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Barr </PERSON>'s office has filed a civil suit against two <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> men the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> says kept proceeds from <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> real estate closings The lawsuit, which contends <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> lost $ 840,000 in payments and $ 860,000 in interest, seeks $ 7.5 million in damages. _ In the <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> suburbs of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, a private escrow agent has confessed to stealing more than $ 5 million from <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> Her role was to help the department close on sales of repossessed homes by signing papers and accepting the buyers' money for the property. <PERSON> Marilyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Harrell </PERSON>, nicknamed `` <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> HUD'' because she gave some of the stolen money to the poor, told investigators her operation was simple: She just did n't give the government its money. On Monday, Ms. <PERSON> Harrell </PERSON> turned over her house to the department to cover part of the thefts. Ms. <PERSON> Harrell </PERSON> and unidentified agents in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> became the first agents that <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> will bar from future government contracts, the <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> reported today, quoting <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Keating </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> general counsel-designate. Investigations involve 11 other private escrow agents around the country, and as much as $ 20 million of <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> funds may have been taken this way, according to <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>, the department's inspector general. On another front, revealed just this week, <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> has moved to halt losses from a loan program where some $ 650 million in mortgages are in default. The department moved swiftly to suspend three mortgage companies indefinitely, put three others on six-month probations and review the operations of still three more. <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> officials say a certain amount of fraud is to be expected in a $ 20 billion government agency involved chiefly in making loans and giving away money to help people get shelter and aid the nation's cities But what began quietly as an in-house investigation more than a year ago has since exploded into charges of influence-peddling, betrayal and mismanagement by the people who once held the highest offices in the department. Former Secretary <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> has been criticized for his hands-off style of management. His onetime top aide, <PERSON> Deborah </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Dean </PERSON>, invoked the Fifth Amendment when asked about her role in handing out <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> grants to developers who sometimes paid six-figure sums to big-name Republicans to get favorable consideration for their projects. Geography made little difference. Money went to projects in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> as well as those in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. `` The problem was at the top,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Barney </PERSON> <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>, D-Mass., another member of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> committee investigating <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> `` <PERSON> Deborah </PERSON> <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> was in charge of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Shays </PERSON> agreed. `` People who were not fit to hold office were in charge of that agency,'' he said Monday. `` Mr. <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> had a good resume. He inherited an agency in disarray and left it worse than he found it.'' `` There is always a problem in a democratic society of a push-pull,'' said <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>. `` The people who are trying to politicize a program are pulling against the people who are trying to run it non-politically. `` The difference with <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> was there were no people with real authority to run it non-politically, that you had people in charge at the top who just did n't care about the program.''

All the people here know various pieces. We call on our colleagues in the government all the time, certainly on the Hill too.'' He can call on other experts to fill in some of the gaps, said <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>, director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy. `` Calling in the experts is fine,'' he said. `` You do n't have to have everybody on staff. I've been given a fairly small staff and I have to make it travel a long way.'' Rep. <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Fla </LOCATION>., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Task </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> on <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Narcotics </ORGANIZATION>, and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>'s chief narcotics officer said in interviews that <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> will have difficulty drawing up a national drug strategy, due in September, with his current staff The comments echoed criticisms against <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> by some federal officials, who spoke only on condition of anonymity. `` He's not going to be able to draw up a comprehensive strategy ... and prevent turf wars and figure out how to minimize duplication without having people who have worked in the agencies and know how to do that,'' <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said. `` <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> himself, without any real drug experience, has surrounded himself with people who do n't have any real drug experience, and, without that, they're going to be operating in a vacuum,'' he said. <PERSON> Sterling </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>'s special narcotics prosecutor, said, `` There is no one that I know of with any real law enforcement experience on his team.'' <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> has asked him to join his `` kitchen cabinet'' of unofficial advisers and he'll probably do so. `` I told him that I want him to succeed. If he fails, we all fail,'' said <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Walters </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>'s chief of staff, defended the office's experience, saying more than half of its 60 workers have been sent there from `` every major federal agency involved in anti-drug efforts. Some three dozen federal agencies, including the <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> and the departments of Education and <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>, are part of the war against illegal drugs. Some of the officials criticizing <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> come from agencies that opposed <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>' creation of his office, which is charged with scrutinizing their budgets and priorities as it develops a national strategy. That oversight role, as well as traditional rivalry between agencies, may be responsible for some of the complaints, <PERSON> Walters </PERSON> said in an interview. `` Frankly, I am suspicious of some of the offers for help, because those take the form of a desire to write the strategy for us from people in particular agencies, on the <PERSON> Hill </PERSON> and elsewhere,'' <PERSON> Walters </PERSON> said. `` We want competent staff help, but we do not want someone to do our job for us.'' <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> also has generated criticism by deciding not to fill many permanent positions until his top two deputies are in place, depending for now on temporary staffers detailed from other agencies. His candidates for the deputy slots _ <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Marshals </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> Director <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> for the supply reduction job and Dr. <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Kleber </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> for the demand reduction job _ have not yet been nominated by the White House. <PERSON> Kleber </PERSON> is already on the payroll as a consultant. <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> said he has urged the White House to act on the nominations and he presumed the need for thorough background checks was causing the delay. But he added that he consults with both men regularly and the empty posts will not hinder preparation of an anti-drug strategy.

<HEAD>West Germany Moving Against Firm in Iran Chemical Weapons Deal</HEAD>

 The West German government is taking action against a German firm that arranged the sale to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> of chemicals used in the production of poison gas, according to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials. `` We've been very happy'' with the West German response, one official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told The Associated Press Monday. Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> discussed the sale with Foreign Minister <PERSON> Hans-Dietrich </PERSON> <PERSON> Genscher </PERSON> during <PERSON> Genscher </PERSON>'s visit to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> last week, the officials said.

The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> reported today that the firm had arranged the sale to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> of hundreds of tons of thionyl chloride, a chemical used in the manufacture of mustard gas, by an Indian manufacturer. The bulk of the chemicals was not delivered, according to the Times. During the eight-year Iran-Iraq war, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> complained that its people and troops were the targets of several gas attacks by <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. Last winter, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials accused German firms of helping <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> built a plant that could be used to produce chemical weapons, though <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> insisted the plant would be used for pharmaceuticals. In response, the <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION> government has proposed legislation to stiffen export controls and penalties.

 The federal government cleared the way for strip mining in a national forest in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> after a skimpy review and without independent documentation, congressional investigators say. `` No record exists which suggests that the Office of Surface Mining conducted a thorough analysis'' before deciding a coal company had a legal right to strip mine in <ORGANIZATION> Wayne </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION>, said a report by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>'s mining subcommittee.

<HEAD>Bush, Two State Senates Call for Flag-burning Penalties</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and senates in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> want penalties for desecrating Old Glory, and a town that prides itself as `` Flag City USA'' planned a rally against a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruling permitting flag burning. `` We take our patriotism very seriously in Findlay,'' said <PERSON> Marjory </PERSON> <PERSON> Buckingham </PERSON>, organizer of a Rally for Flag and Country planned for Thursday in the northwest <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> city. `` We feel that any desecration of the flag is wrong, and people who burn flags should know how we feel.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruled Wednesday that burning the American flag as a form of protest is protected by free-speech guarantees. `` If there is a bedrock principle underlying the First Amendment, it is that the government may not prohibit the expression of an idea simply because society finds the idea itself offensive or disagreeable,'' Justice <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON> said in his opinion for the court. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> reacted Friday by passing legislation aimed at making desecration of the flag unlawful, and the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> may consider a similar resolution this week. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> supports legislation prohibiting the desecration of the flag, but has not decided whether to back a constitutional amendement, his spokesman said Monday. Press Secretary <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> `` shares the views of members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and others who have all expressed their feeling that the flag should not be desecrated in any way.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who said after the ruling that flag burning is `` dead wrong,'' told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> in an interview published today that he has asked Attorney General <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> and Chief of Staff <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> to recommend ways to circumvent the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> decision. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he was `` open-minded'' about how to protect the flag. Lawmakers are divided on whether to offer legislation or seek a constitutional amendment. In <LOCATION> Sacramento </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> voted 58-2 Monday to ask <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to amend the Constitution to outlaw flag burning. `` What kind of message are we sending our children when we say it's OK to burn the flag?'' Republican <PERSON> Assemblyman </PERSON> <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> Leslie </PERSON> asked in a debate in which he described his father's death during World War II and displayed the flag used for his father's services. Democratic Assemblyman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Burton </PERSON>, who opposed the resolution, said `` our country is great because we allow people to be wrong ... and do some stupidly outrageous things.'' In <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> unanimously approved a bill Monday that would make it a felony to intentionally place the flag on a floor. Offenders could receive up to six years in prison. The measure goes to Gov. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON>. The bill was one of several proposed in response to an <ORGANIZATION> Art </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> exhibit that featured a flag on the gallery floor. The bill's sponsor, Democratic Sen. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Dunn </PERSON>, said placing the flag on the floor is `` the most insulting thing to do in this country.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> on Friday also approved a resolution that calls for <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to take measures to protect the flag from desecration. In Findlay, about 1,000 people are expected to attend the rally, Ms. <PERSON> Buckingham </PERSON> said. `` It's a hard pill to swallow that the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> would pass a ruling that would support the burning of the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> flag after Americans have given their lives for it,'' said <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Mazey </PERSON>, commander of a Veterans of Foreign Wars post in the <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> town.

<HEAD>Four Cases of HIV-2 Confirmed in NYC</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A strain of the AIDS virus that's widespread in west <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> but is rare in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has infected at least four people in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, authorities said. The four confirmed and two unconfirmed but likely cases of HIV-2 infections represent the largest concentration of such infections in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> reported today. They were discovered among hundreds of blood samples from people who sought to be tested for AIDS in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, officials said. `` The bad news is that, yes, HIV-2 infection is here,'' said city Health Commissioner Dr. <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON>. `` The good news is it apparently has not gotten into the blood supply.'' HIV-2 is not always detected by standard AIDS tests. The finding means uncertainty for people who already have passed such tests and also means blood banks will have a tougher time making sure a donation is AIDS-free. But AIDS researchers say the number of HIV-2-infected people in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is probably small and mostly limited to immigrants from western <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, the Times said. Dr. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Curran </PERSON>, director of AIDS programs at the federal <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION>, said that while HIV-2 cases are likely to become more common in this country, `` It is not currently a great threat to the public.'' <PERSON> Curran </PERSON> said that outside <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, there have been fewer than 10 reports of HIV-2 infections in the country. The standard AIDS test is designed to detect antibodies generated by the HIV-1 virus. It is able to detect HIV-2 between 45 percent and 90 percent of the time, <PERSON> Curran </PERSON> said, citing figures presented at an international AIDS conference in <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION>. Health officials say <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s blood supply appears safe. If an AIDS test is inconclusive, blood banks discard the donation. And blood banks routinely ask donors who are in high AIDS-risk groups not to give blood, or to donate it for research rather than transfusion. Health experts disagree on whether HIV-2 is as dangerous as HIV-1. Some studies suggest that fewer HIV-2-infected people go on to develop full-blown AIDS. But researchers note that HIV-1 has had longer to spread and develop and that the development of symptoms may take more time in an HIV-2 infection.

 A tribunal of <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>'s highest-ranking military officers recommended early today that a highly-decorated general be court-martialed for allegedly organizing rings that trafficked in cocaine, ivory and diamonds. The state-run news agency <ORGANIZATION> Prensa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Latina </ORGANIZATION> said the 47-member tribunal recommended after two days of hearings that Division Gen. <PERSON> Arnalfo </PERSON> <PERSON> Ochoa </PERSON> be dishonorably discharged and lose all his military honors. The panel called <PERSON> Ochoa </PERSON>'s acts a serious blow to <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>'s international prestige and said they threatened national security It said a `` serious lack of moral character and corruption, dishonest management, improper use and pilferage of economic resources'' had been proved. In testimony broadcast by state-run television Monday, witnesses told of officers under <PERSON> Ochoa </PERSON>'s 1987-88 command in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> selling troops' supplies on the black market, smuggling diamonds and ivory and receiving kickbacks. They also said he had helped Colombian cocaine bosses use <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> as a way station for smuggling operations to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The witnesses _ three colonels, two lieutenant colonels and two captains _ testified before the tribunal on Sunday, the day <PERSON> Ochoa </PERSON> admitted guilt and `` accepted responsibility'' for his actions, according to <PERSON> Prensa </PERSON> <PERSON> Latina </PERSON>. Defense Minister Gen. <PERSON> Raul </PERSON> <PERSON> Castro </PERSON>, brother of President <PERSON> Fidel </PERSON> <PERSON> Castro </PERSON>, told the tribunal Sunday that <PERSON> Ochoa </PERSON>'s punishment should `` set an example.'' Some Foreign Ministry officials interpreted this to mean <PERSON> Ochoa </PERSON> might face a firing squad. But others speculated <PERSON> Ochoa </PERSON> might be spared because of his combat service, his long friendship with the defense chief and his high rank. In their testimony, the witnesses gave detailed accounts of black market dealings involving diamonds, ivory, sugar, TV sets, tape recorders, coffee, wheat, dried fish and sides of beef. Most said they had believed the sales and conversion of the proceeds into dollars were geared to shoring up the troubled Cuban economy. They also said they believed the money was meant to improve the quality of life of the Cuban troops in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>, who were helping the Marxist goverment fight guerrillas. At least $ 200,000 of the proceeds from those sales ended up in a Panamanian bank account apparently managed by <PERSON> Ochoa </PERSON>, witnesses said. They testified that part of the money went toward buying refrigerators, stereo equipment, juice extractors, a bed, and clothing for several officers, including <PERSON> Ochoa </PERSON>. Capt. <PERSON> Jorge </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> <PERSON> Valdez </PERSON>, <PERSON> Ochoa </PERSON>'s assistant and one of the witnesses, testified that he began money-laundering transactions with Panamanians and Colombians as early as 1985 on behalf of <PERSON> Ochoa </PERSON>. He described direct contacts with leaders of the <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> cartel, the world's largest cocaine-smuggling operation, based in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> said that the Colombians were under the impression that their <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> connection had official sanction. `` The Colombians thought that we were official representatives of <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> testified. `` In the visit to <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>, they were put up at an official protocol house and a <ORGANIZATION> Mercedes-Benz </ORGANIZATION> was placed at their disposal.'' <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> said the Colombians, during one of their three visits to <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>, proposed printing dollars in <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> and even setting up a cocaine laboratory on the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> island. He said the Cuban officers involved only accepted helping the Colombians push their product toward the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> said he traveled to <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> on a false passport provided by the cartel and met with cartel head <PERSON> Pablo </PERSON> <PERSON> Escobar </PERSON>. He said the drug lord talked about obtaining some ground-to-air missiles `` for his own personal protection so he could defend himself against helicopters.'' <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> has mounted an intensive public relations campaign against <PERSON> Ochoa </PERSON>, describing his alleged corruption in extraordinary detail in <LOCATION> Granma </LOCATION>, the official newspaper of the ruling <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. In a break from its usual reticence to report on internal affairs, <PERSON> Prensa </PERSON> <PERSON> Latina </PERSON> has distributed extensive reports on the drug scandal. <PERSON> Ochoa </PERSON> was decorated for his service as a field commander in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> in 1987 and 1988 and is one of only five officers ever awarded the Hero of the Republic of <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>.

 The first voyage of the replica of <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON>'s 17th century ship has been delayed for about a year because of the death of the ship's architect in an accident. The $ 1 million Half Moon had been scheduled to set sail July 5 on a goodwill tour of 10 ports in the Northeast. The trip has been rescheduled tentatively for next spring, organizers said Monday. The Half <PERSON> Moon </PERSON>'s architect, <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Benton </PERSON>, 35, of <LOCATION> Middletown </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> R.I. </LOCATION>, was killed last Monday when the mast of another ship he was working on snapped and threw him 75 feet to the ground. `` To ensure that Mr. <PERSON> Benton </PERSON>'s project is completed in the manner he intended, we are seeking outside experts to complete the ship,'' said <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Hendricks </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> resident who initiated the project.

 A grant from a tobacco company is keeping the National Women's Hall of Fame open, and one of the nation's leading feminists is incensed. After launching an urgent fund-raising drive June 13, the hall's board of directors on Monday announced that a $ 35,000 donation from the <ORGANIZATION> Philip </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Companies </ORGANIZATION> and a $ 100,000 <ORGANIZATION> Gannett </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> grant would provide funds for five years But the decision to take money from <ORGANIZATION> Philip </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morris </ORGANIZATION>, whose products include cigarettes, drew heat from <PERSON> Molly </PERSON> <PERSON> Yard </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Women </ORGANIZATION>. `` Smoking is a feminist issue,'' <PERSON> Yard </PERSON> said. `` Cigarettes are killing women. Women's organizations are going to have to stop taking money from the merchants of death.'' The news of the donations brought hearty applause from a meeting of about 50 hall members led by <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Howland </PERSON>. <PERSON> Howland </PERSON> said she is a former smoker and `` I think everybody ought to quit.'' But she said smoking `` is still legal in this country. I might feel a little different if it was the Mafia; I might not as long as the money was there.'' The hall, founded in 1968, is located in an old bank building in this upstate <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> village that bills itself as `` The Birthplace of Women's Rights.'' <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Cady </PERSON> <PERSON> Stanton </PERSON> and 300 other women held the first <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> women's right convention here in 1848 and issued a demand for equal schooling and wages for women, as well as suffrage. The Women's Rights National Historical Park, which commemorates that event, is funded by the Department of the Interior. But the hall, a private, non-profit educational institute, had overdrawn its operating account and was $ 68,000 in debt before the drive. <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> spokeswoman <PERSON> Posie </PERSON> <PERSON> DiSesa </PERSON> said the company made its donation of $ 10,000 in cash and $ 25,000 in public relations and fund-raising services out of `` corporate benevolence,'' and did not expect any promotion in exchange. Despite her displeasure with the <ORGANIZATION> Philip </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morris </ORGANIZATION> donation, <ORGANIZATION> Yard </ORGANIZATION> said it was important to keep the hall open. `` It's the only place in the country where there's any attempt to keep records of leading <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> women,'' she said. An earlier appeal for funds the national women's organizations might have made it unnecessary to resort to <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Morris </PERSON>, she said. One former president of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Women </ORGANIZATION> defended the decision. `` It seems to me they have a perfect right to be involved,'' said <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> DeCrow </PERSON>, now an attorney in <LOCATION> Syracuse </LOCATION>. `` I hope people do n't drink and drive and I hope kids do n't smoke cigarettes, but that does n't mean they ca n't be involved.

<HEAD>Critics Lash Supreme Court Ruling as `Barbaric'</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-Scotus Rdp, Bjt</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 Prosecutors praised <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> decisions that allow the execution of teen-age or retarded murderers, but defense attorneys and civil rights groups said the rulings degraded the nation. In two 5-4 votes Monday, the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> said the Constitution's ban on cruel and unusual punishment does not prohibit execution of juveniles as young as age 16 or adults with the reasoning capacity of children. <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> Attorney General <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Bowers </PERSON> noted that the court last year threw out the death sentence of an Oklahoman who murdered at age 15, and said the rulings together provided a clear age delineation for prosecutors and lawmakers considering capital punishment. `` Lines have to be drawn somewhere,'' <PERSON> Bowers </PERSON> said on <ORGANIZATION> ABC-TV </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Nightline'' program `` I do not think the line is drawn inappropriately.'' <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Schwarzschild </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>'s capital punishment project in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, however, called the decision `` barbaric and medieval. `` If you were to open up the paper tomorrow and read that the French government or the British or some other civilized nation were holding 30 kids that were going to be executed, you'd think, ` Good God, wrong dateline. They mean <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Schwarzschild </PERSON> said. Of the 2,200 convicted murderers on death rows in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, at least 32 committed their crimes under age 18. At least 11 states have one or more inmates under a death penalty for crimes committed before they were 18, according to state officials. <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> topped the list with nine, followed by <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> with four each. <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoey </PERSON>, a lobbyist for the <ORGANIZATION> Missouri </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION>, said the ruling probably will make it more difficult to persuade state lawmakers to pass a measure setting 18 as the minimum age at which murderers can be subjected to capital punishment. <PERSON> Hoey </PERSON>, who unsuccessfully pushed such a measure during the 1989 session, said many lawmakers think it's `` political suicide'' to vote against the death penalty, although voters who support capital punishment might be more lenient toward teen-agers. `` Adolescents do n't think out the consequences of their acts,'' <PERSON> Hoey </PERSON> said. `` It's an emotional, turbulent time of their lives. Although they can do adult acts, they do n't think like adults.'' The high court's ruling upheld death sentences for <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Stanford </PERSON>, who was 17 when he abducted and murdered a gas station attendant in 1981, and <PERSON> Heath </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilkins </PERSON>, 16 when he stabbed a <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo. </LOCATION>, area liquor store clerk to death in 1985. <PERSON> Wilkins </PERSON>' crime was especially gruesome. He stabbed <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON>, a 26-year-old mother of two, in the back and chest, and stabbed her four times in the throat after she pleaded for mercy. Missouri Attorney General <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Webster </PERSON> said arguments that the ruling would lead to large-scale executions of minors was `` hogwash.'' `` There's a lot of people that say it's going to open the door. That's ludicrous,'' said <PERSON> Webster </PERSON>. <PERSON> Webster </PERSON> said that before a juvenile can face the death penalty, he or she has to be certified as an adult, go through a battery of mental exams and have their age considered as a mitigating circumstance by the judge. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Touchette </PERSON>, the attorney for <PERSON> Paula </PERSON> <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON>, said the ruling probably will not affect her case. She was 15 when she stabbed a retired <PERSON> Gary </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Ind. </LOCATION>, Bible teacher to death. Her case has drawn international attention and a call for clemency from Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> II. In its ruling, the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> said convicted murderers have a right to demand that sentencing juries and judges consider mental retardation as a possible mitigating factor. Arguments on cruel and unusual punishment have been raised in two pending <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> cases with mentally impaired defendants, said Deputy Attorney General <PERSON> Dane </PERSON> <PERSON> Gillette </PERSON> in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. In one case, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Odle </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Pinole </LOCATION> was sentenced to death for the 1980 slaying of a woman and the killing of a policeman three days later. Defense lawyers have cited the brain damage <PERSON> Odle </PERSON> suffered in a 1973 auto accident and a later lobotomy operation that removed a portion of his brain. In the second case, <PERSON> Melvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Wade </PERSON>, a mentally disturbed <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bernardino </LOCATION> man, was condemned for the torture murder of his 10-year-old stepdaughter in 1981.

<HEAD>The State Department Wants To Talk to Willie Star</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Updates with Star quotes and edits throughout.</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Willie </PERSON> <PERSON> Star </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> wants to talk to you. T.W. `` Willie'' Star is listed as the ambassador to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Nauru </LOCATION>, a tiny dot in the western <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION>, and is next in line to become dean of the diplomatic corps in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. That is, if he's still the ambassador and if he returns to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Star presented his credentials to President <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> on June 6, 1980, and then vanished. For a long time, he doubled as <LOCATION> Nauru </LOCATION>'s ambassador to <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> and was living in <LOCATION> Melbourne </LOCATION> But while the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> could n't find Star, he was quietly going about his business as the consul-general in <LOCATION> Guam </LOCATION>, about 1,000 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Nauru </LOCATION>. Star, reached by telephone from <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>, said he has been <LOCATION> Nauru </LOCATION>'s consul-general there for about a year and seemed puzzled that the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> was looking for him `` I have to talk to my government,'' he said today, in response to questions. But Star was n't sure about his diplomatic status in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Asked if he is still <LOCATION> Nauru </LOCATION>'s ambassador to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, he answered, `` I do n't think so. I do n't know. I'll have to talk to my government,'' and refused elaboration. Star's presence on <LOCATION> Guam </LOCATION>, half a world away from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, explains why he's little known in the capital city. `` I've never met him, but I understand he's in his 40s and that he's been an ambassador for some time,'' said <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Radewagen </PERSON>, a part-time consultant for the government of <LOCATION> Nauru </LOCATION>. `` I'm told that he's articulate, gregarious and quite intelligent.'' The State Department's manhunt began shortly after the retirement last month of Swedish Ambassador <PERSON> Wilhelm </PERSON> <PERSON> Wachtmeister </PERSON>, who was dean of the diplomatic corps for three years. Under the rules of protocol, the largely ceremonial post goes to the foreign ambassador with the most seniority, based on the date when the envoy's credentials were presented to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> president. To be eligible, an ambassador must maintain an official residence here. That ruled out the diplomatic representative from <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Samoa </LOCATION>, who was next in line but does n't live in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. Next was the southwestern <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> nation of <LOCATION> Tuvalu </LOCATION>, but its ambassador had already been transferred elsewhere. Then came Cypriot Ambassador <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Jacovides </PERSON>, who had barely succeeded to the deanship when he was summoned home for a job in the foreign ministry. Next on the list was <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Sukru </PERSON> <PERSON> Elekdag </PERSON>, but he's retiring. So up popped the mystery name of T.W. Star, who was listed as the only ambassador of the steaming hot island of <LOCATION> Nauru </LOCATION>, the third smallest country in the world after <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Monaco </ORGANIZATION> and surely on nobody's list as a vacation paradise. The fewer than 9,000 people who inhabit <LOCATION> Nauru </LOCATION>'s eight square miles of coral just south of the Equator must endure an average 82 inches of rainfall annually. They are consoled, however, by the wealth of their phosphate mines, which produce $ 100 million a year in fertilizer exports. Although <LOCATION> Nauru </LOCATION> does have swaying palm trees, <PERSON> Radewagen </PERSON> said, `` they've been digging a large part of the island and carting it away for years, and now it's so pockmarked and barren that it looks like the Badlands of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>.'' The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> sent a letter to Star via the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassador in <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> earlier this month informing him of his opportunity to become dean of the diplomatic corps, provided he moves his residence to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. So far, Star has not replied. Meanwhile, several cables have been dispatched to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> officials in <LOCATION> Canberra </LOCATION> about the matter `` but they have n't said much of anything,'' reported one insider. If Star does n't respond by the time <PERSON> Jacovides </PERSON> leaves <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> for <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION> in early July, they said, the job probably will be offered to the next in line, Ambassador <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Fernandes </PERSON> <PERSON> Lopes </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Verde </LOCATION>. One State Department official, who spoke only on condition that he not be identified, said he has a hunch Star completed his <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> assignment some time ago and the <LOCATION> Nauru </LOCATION> government never bothered to name a successor. `` He is still on the books as ambassador, but I'm not sure he really is,'' the official said.

 The <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> has turned down an appeal by 14 <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> churches of an archdiocesan order to close by July 1, and five parishes that had planned to defy Cardinal <PERSON> Edmund </PERSON> <PERSON> Szoka </PERSON> were reconsidering their opposition.

The archdiocese has announced plans to close 30 churches due to declining membership. `` There is a real discouragement among the people here that <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> did n't care about the injustices that have happened,'' Sister <PERSON> Jolene </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Handel </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Handel </PERSON> is coordinator of the <ORGANIZATION> Detroit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pastoral </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION>, a coalition of priests and laypeople opposed to <PERSON> Szoka </PERSON>'s plan. Nine parishes had said they would remain open, but some opposition eroded after a series of private weekend meetings between priests and <PERSON> Szoka </PERSON>, who ordered the closings in January after two committees made up of church and civic leaders recommended the plan. Two parishes that had planned to defy the cardinal said they now expect to accept the order, and close by Friday. The pastor of a third congregation urged his parishioners to drop their opposition.

<HEAD>Former Housekeeper Says Hurt Ordered Records Shredded</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Actor <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Hurt </PERSON> became worried that his house was bugged when he learned his former live-in lover was suing him, and ordered his housekeeper to shred financial records, the former employee testified. `` He told me I had to take the financial records and quietly destroy them,'' <PERSON> Dianna </PERSON> <PERSON> Schiebel </PERSON> said Monday on the fifth day of a trial to determine whether Hurt, 39, had a common-law marriage with dancer <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Jennings </PERSON>, the 32-year-old mother of <PERSON> Hurt </PERSON>'s son. <PERSON> Jennings </PERSON> is suing Hurt for divorce, claiming that a common-law marriage exists between them, based on four weeks the couple spent in <LOCATION> Beaufort </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION>, where he was filming `` The Big Chill.'' She says the marriage began Dec. 9, 1982, when the actor learned he was divorced from actress <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Beth </PERSON> <PERSON> Hurt </PERSON>. He and <PERSON> Jennings </PERSON> left the state Jan. 10, 1983. Hurt and <PERSON> Jennings </PERSON> were together about three years, spending most of the time in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, which does not permit common-law marriages. <PERSON> Schiebel </PERSON> said she met Hurt in May 1987 when he hired her housekeeping firm. She said he often called <PERSON> Jennings </PERSON> and their son, <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Devon </PERSON> <PERSON> Hurt </PERSON>, now 6, `` my family.'' <PERSON> Schiebel </PERSON>, who eventually became Hurt's personal assistant, said <PERSON> Hurt </PERSON> became worried that his house was bugged when he learned <PERSON> Jennings </PERSON> was going to sue him. `` He started looking for a company to sweep the house for bugs,'' she said. She said <PERSON> Hurt </PERSON> told her: `` We have to be very careful from now on in everything we say and do because <PERSON> Sandy </PERSON> will be looking for information that could hurt me.'' <PERSON> Schiebel </PERSON> said she put the financial records through Hurt's personal shredder after she was asked to destroy them <PERSON> Schiebel </PERSON> said <PERSON> Hurt </PERSON> told her he was afraid he could lose everything. Hurt, at the defense table, lowered his head and ran his fingers through his hair during the testimony. <PERSON> Jennings </PERSON> sat with her back to him and stared at the witness. In another development in the state court case, a professor at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carolina </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> hired by <PERSON> Hurt </PERSON> testified Monday that Hurt and <PERSON> Jennings </PERSON> did not meet that state's requirements for a common-law marriage. <PERSON> Randall </PERSON> <PERSON> Chastaine </PERSON> testified that common-law marriage is defined under <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> civil statutes as an agreement at a specific time between a man and a woman that they are married. Earlier Monday, <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Graber </PERSON>, a lawyer from <LOCATION> Port </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Royal </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION>, said Hurt and <PERSON> Jennings </PERSON> came to his <LOCATION> Beaufort </LOCATION> office in late December 1982, and signed what he considered to be a premarital agreement. `` I remember being impressed by the detail and its length,'' <PERSON> Graber </PERSON> testified. Hurt previously testified that he did not recall ever signing any documents in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> and that he never referred to his lover as his wife. <PERSON> Jennings </PERSON> wants up to half of everything Hurt has earned for the past 6 -LCB- years. Her attorney says Hurt, who starred in `` Kiss of the Spider Woman,'' `` Gorky Park,'' and `` Body Heat,'' has assets of about $ 10 million.

<HEAD>Two Palestinian Prisoners Reported Killed as Collaborators</HEAD>

<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A Palestinian inmate at <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s desert prison camp killed two fellow Arabs, and <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION> said the attacker was retaliating for the prisoners' alleged collaboration with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. The killings, discovered today during the morning prisoner count, raised to four the number of prisoners slain in the last two weeks at the <LOCATION> Ketziot </LOCATION> prison in the <LOCATION> Negev </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Desert </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Jersualem </LOCATION>, a spokesman for Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> leader planned to hold the first meeting on his peace plan in July with Palestinian leaders from the occupied territories. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Avi </PERSON> <PERSON> Pazner </PERSON> denied reports in the <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> media that <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> will meet with supporters of the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, which has rejected the plan. In its report on the overnight prison slayings, <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION> said the killer attacked the two victims because he suspected them of collaborating with Israeli authorities. The army confirmed the deaths, but said police were still investigating the reason for the murders. An army spokesman identified the victims as <PERSON> Mahmoud </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdul </PERSON> <PERSON> Abedgalla </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Hijazi </PERSON> <PERSON> Taaf </PERSON>, both of the occupied <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. The spokesman, who may not be identified under military regulations, said a fellow inmate was arrested and confessed to the murders. He gave no details on how or exactly why the men were murdered. Last week at the prison, a 23-year-old Palestinian carried the body of <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Faraj </PERSON> <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Jadalla </PERSON> out of a tent, threw it in front of a guard and said he strangled <PERSON> Jadalla </PERSON> because the man collaborated with <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> authorities, the news agency <ORGANIZATION> Itim </ORGANIZATION> said. Earlier in the week, another Palestinian, 19-year-old <PERSON> Samir </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Antiz </PERSON> was found dead in his tent. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio said <PERSON> Antiz </PERSON> apparently was killed by fellow prisoners who accused him of collaborating with the <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> authorities. Also today, a 17-year-old Palestinian died of wounds sustained in a clash with troops on Saturday, Arab hospital officials and the army said. The victim, identified as <PERSON> Tarek </PERSON> <PERSON> Salih </PERSON> <PERSON> Awad </PERSON>, was wounded during a confrontation in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> village of <LOCATION> Idna </LOCATION>. The three deaths today raised to 539 the Palestinian death toll in the 1 -LCB- - year-old uprising against Israeli rule Seventy of the victims have been killed by fellow Arabs as collaborators. Twenty-three Israelis also have been slain. In the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, troops opened fire on a group of Palestinian stone-throwers today and wounded 13 people, including four 11-year-olds, Arab hospital officials said. An army spokesman said the military was investigating the incident. Also today, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio quoted police as saying that ballistics tests showed a 20-year-old Bedouin shepherd fatally wounded Friday was shot by one of seven Jewish settlers held in connection with a settler raid on a <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> village. Police did not release the name of the accused, the radio said. The <ORGANIZATION> Haaretz </ORGANIZATION> newspaper published a poll showing Israelis are almost evenly divided on whether settler vigilante raids in reaction to Arab stone-throwing attacks are justified. The poll, conducted by the Tel Aviv-based <ORGANIZATION> PORI </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, said 44.3 percent of the 1,200 Israelis questioned found the attacks justified and 44.6 percent did not. Seven percent said raids should depend on the circumstances, and 4 percent gave no answer. No margin of error for the poll was given. In his comments, <PERSON> Pazner </PERSON> said <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> would begin meetings with Palestinian leaders from both the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> in July. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> captured the territories in the 1967 Middle East War from neighboring Arab states. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s plan calls for elections and limited autonomy in the occupied territories. The <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> and most Palestinian leaders instead support an independent Palestinian state. `` There will be no <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> supporters,'' <PERSON> Pazner </PERSON> said when asked about news reports that such people would be included. He said <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> leaders have agreed to attend, but he would not reveal their names.

 A smouldering controversy among Bible scholars has burst into the open over the long delay in publishing the rest of the Dead Sea Scrolls. Although the first-century manuscripts were found 42 years ago, fewer than half has been published, and some researchers in ancient religious history say they're fed up with waiting. `` It's disgraceful,'' said historian <PERSON> Morton </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, charging that the scrolls editors have `` sat on the material for years,'' keeping it from other scholars and the public. The scrolls contain portions of the Old Testament far older than any previously available. It also contains documents about Jewish life during the early days of Christianity. Much of the material has remained only in the hands of a small team of scholars deciphering it. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Noel </PERSON> <PERSON> Freedman </PERSON>, professor of biblical studies at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Michigan </ORGANIZATION>, said 40 years is `` much too long to keep the material from public scrutiny.'' Only the scroll scholars `` and their friends know what is going on,'' he said in a telephone interview. `` They've kept that work in the dark and a whole generation has gone by. It's long past time for some changes.'' <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said the inaccessbility has caused him to postpone research. `` I've just been disgusted,'' he said. `` This is an important body of material for understanding both intellectual and religious history,'' he said. `` For it to be kept secret from other scholars and general knowledge, I think is simply outrageous.'' Renewed complaints about the matter were published in the current issue of the bimonthly, <ORGANIZATION> Biblical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Archaeology </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Review </ORGANIZATION>, which headlined an editorial, `` Dead Sea Scrolls Scandal.'' <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Strugnell </PERSON>, who heads the scroll team of about 20 scholars, said critics are unaware of the complexities of the work. He also said the work is being speeded up. `` They are ignorant of a project like this,'' he said in a telephone interview from <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>. `` They do n't know the kind of material we're working with. We must deal always with small fragments that must be put together.'' He acknowledged the work had gone too slowly for the first 20 years, mainly because of a lack of financing. Only three volumes of scrolls were put out during that period, but nine volumes have been produced since l976. `` We are producing,'' he said. `` It's slow business. But we're getting faster An immense amount of work is being done.'' <PERSON> Freedman </PERSON>, editor of a 30-volume Anchor series being publish by Doubleday on books of the Bible, said that within a year or two after such manuscripts are found, photographic slides should be available to any scholar. `` For a single person to retain access to these materials is simply unacceptable,'' he said. The scrolls contain portions of every book of the Old Testament and are about 1,000 years older than any previously available biblical manuscripts, including the complete book of <PERSON> Isaiah </PERSON> and much of Lamentations. There also are documents of the Qumron community of ascetics known as the Essenes, including a still unpublished, much-awaited letter from the head of the community, the Teacher of Righteousness, to <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>'s high priest. `` We hope to have that out by the end of the year,'' <PERSON> Strugnell </PERSON> said. `` That's a top priority.'' In <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Antiquities </ORGANIZATION> under which the work is being done, said it has set up a timetable in which the scholars had agreed to publish all of their materials by 1996. <PERSON> Amir </PERSON> <PERSON> Drori </PERSON>, head of the department, said the scholars had been urged to share the workload with other researchers. If `` someone does not complete his work on time, we have the right to deliver the scrolls to someone else,'' <PERSON> Drori </PERSON> said. The team of which <PERSON> Strugnell </PERSON> is a part began their work about 1954. He said that intitially there was insufficient funding available for it, but he has found donors to fill that gap. `` For the last five or six years, we've been trying to get additional scholars on the project,'' he said. `` That should acclerate it.''

 The convictions of three of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>'s most powerful mafia members in a plot to kill reputed <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> godfather <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Gotti </PERSON> and his brother are a major setback for the mob, prosecutors said. `` We have a hope of making organized crime a historic relic rather than something that preys on people in the community year in and year out,'' assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Chertoff </PERSON> said Monday. A federal jury Monday convicted <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> A. `` Bobby'' Manna of <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, the reputed consigliere, or No. 3 leader of the Genovese crime family; restaurateur <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> `` Motts'' <PERSON> Casella </PERSON>; and enforcer <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> `` Bocci'' DeSciscio of plotting to kill <PERSON> Gotti </PERSON>, the flamboyant reputed boss of the rival <PERSON> Gambino </PERSON> family, and his brother <PERSON> Gene </PERSON>. They also were found guilty of arranging the 1987 <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> restaurant murder of <PERSON> Irwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Schiff </PERSON>, a 350-pound, mob-linked businessman. Also convicted of racketeering conspiracy were the group's arms supplier, former <LOCATION> Hoboken </LOCATION> police Lt. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> `` Dipsy'' <PERSON> Daniello </PERSON> and laborer's union official <PERSON> Rocco </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Napoli </PERSON>. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Derrico </PERSON>, 27, of <LOCATION> Hoboken </LOCATION>, a cook at <ORGANIZATION> Casella </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> restaurant, was acquitted on all counts but a gambling charge. The jury returned the verdict on the morning of its fifth day of deliberations after a 3 -LCB- - month trial <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Alito </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> said the convictions were particularly damaging because the <PERSON> Genovese </PERSON> family dominated Mafia activity in northern <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>. `` Any organization that can plot to kill <PERSON> John </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> Gotti </PERSON> from the rival Gambino crime family is obviously a very powerful force,'' said <PERSON> Alito </PERSON>. Manna's faction has operated since the 1950s with `` virtual impunity,'' he said. The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> tipped <PERSON> Gotti </PERSON> to the plot. He was targeted in a power struggle, authorities said. The government has said <PERSON> Schiff </PERSON> may have been killed because he threatened to expose Genovese activity or because he could no longer be trusted with a $ 25 million - $ 40 million mob money-laundering operation The defendants barely reacted to the verdict announcements. <PERSON> DeSciscio </PERSON> blinked and looked away as his wife <PERSON> Ellen </PERSON> sobbed. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Maryanne </PERSON> <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> ordered that all the defendants except <PERSON> Derrico </PERSON> be held until sentencing.

<HEAD>Vote to Split Venice In Two Fails</HEAD>
<DATELINE>VENICE, Italy (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Venetians have decided to stay together, defeating a referendum that called for divorcing the romantic lagoon city from a dependent, blue-collar suburb on the mainland. The referendum, with balloting on Sunday and Monday, was pressed for by officials in <PERSON> Mestre </PERSON>, a community that is administratively part of the city across the causeway but has little in common with the fabled place of singing gondoliers and smelly canals. <PERSON> Mestre </PERSON> politicians say the growing community's needs are different from those of aging, tourist-choked <LOCATION> Venice </LOCATION> and that <PERSON> Mestre </PERSON>'s identity is overwhelmed by <LOCATION> Venice </LOCATION>'s fame. While citizens of <PERSON> Mestre </PERSON> outnumber the citizens of historic <LOCATION> Venice </LOCATION>, 3-1, the measure nevertheless went down to defeat, 58 percent against separation, 42 percent in favor. Lacking affordable housing, young Venetians have been steadily moving out of the lagoon city to <PERSON> Mestre </PERSON>. In 1951, historic <LOCATION> Venice </LOCATION> had 175,000 people while <PERSON> Mestre </PERSON> had about 50,000. In 1987, <LOCATION> Venice </LOCATION>'s population stood at 83,000 while <PERSON> Mestre </PERSON> has 250,000. With souvenir stores far outnumbering butcher and grocery shops, remaining Venetians depend greatly on <PERSON> Mestre </PERSON> for shopping. Ten years ago, a group of influential Venetians lobbied for a similar referendum. That proposal was defeated with more than 72 percent of the voters opposed to separation.

 Rules for humane treatment of laboratory animals adopted by this city will serve as a rallying point for protection campaigns elsewhere, says an animal rights activist. The ordinance, adopted unanimously Monday evening by the <ORGANIZATION> Cambridge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, will affect vertebrates used in studies at <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institution </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION> and 11 other academic institutes and private research firms. The council put teeth in the guidelines by creating a commissioner's post to oversee and enforce the regulations. `` A gaping loophole in the federal law is now closed,'' <PERSON> Gul </PERSON> <PERSON> Agha </PERSON>, who initiated the legislation three years ago when he was a researcher at <ORGANIZATION> MIT </ORGANIZATION>, said after the vote. <PERSON> Agha </PERSON>, who teaches computer science at <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, said that as a researcher he saw lab animals subjected to insufficient ventilation, physicial abuse, rusted cages and starvation. <PERSON> Agha </PERSON> estimated that animal research is a $ 100 million-a-year business in <LOCATION> Cambridge </LOCATION>, and said about 60,000 animals annually are the subject of experiments. The vote Monday marked the first time a local jurisdiction has ordered such far-reaching regulations on animal experimentation, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Cambridge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Responsible </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. Grassroots groups have begun organizing campaigns for similar measures in <LOCATION> Amherst </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Berkeley </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Agha </PERSON> said Researchers in general have not fought the ordinance, maintaining that they already comply with state and federal regulations. `` Cambridge institutions are now carrying out high quality animal care,'' said Dr. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Moses </PERSON>, chairman of the animal care committee at <ORGANIZATION> MIT </ORGANIZATION>. `` Involvement by the city will help prevent further misunderstandings about the nature of that care by ... increasing public accountability.'' The newly adopted legislation expands federal and state regulations concerning humane treatment of laboratory animals by including all vertebrates. A vertebrate is any animal with a backbone or spinal column, including mammals, fish, birds and reptiles. Current federal law deals with dogs, cats and monkeys and excludes reptiles, amphibians, mice, rats and rabbits, said <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Wise </PERSON>, an animal rights attorney. In 1987, the mayor named Wise along with a physician and a veterinarian to come up with recommendations now contained in the ordinance. The panel inspected several research laboratories in <LOCATION> Cambridge </LOCATION> and found no significant animal abuse. The position of commissioner of laboratory animals created by the ordinance can make unannounced visits to research sites, conduct hearings and impose fines of $ 300 per day, per violation.

 <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> billionaire <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> <PERSON> Perot </PERSON> is offering advice as well as money, and others have contributed gifts ranging from flowers to chicken soup to help the historic Treaty Oak recover from a poisoning attack. Concerned people have lent moral support by leaving the tree get-well messages, bunches of flowers and rock crystals, which some believe have healing powers. Monday, a votive candle and a can of cream of chicken soup were among the offerings. Meanwhile, an officer on the case said police are taking a `` long, hard look'' at a suspect in the poisoning. `` We're getting there,'' said <LOCATION> Austin </LOCATION> Police Sgt. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>. He said officers are concentrating on someone identified in telephone tips to make sure the person is a `` legitimate suspect.'' `` The publicity and the reward tend to bring out everyone,'' said <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, who is investigating the case as second-degree felony criminal mischief. Velpar, a powerful herbicide, was poured around the oak's base. According to legend, <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Austin </PERSON>, the father of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, signed a treaty with the <ORGANIZATION> Indians </ORGANIZATION> under the tree's branches. The Handbook of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, however, gives little credence to that story. The tree was admitted to the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forestry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>'s Hall of Fame in 1927. The live oak is about 50 feet tall, has a 127-foot limb spread and is 52.5 inches in diameter at chest height. The centuries-old live oak has been losing leaves and expending its reserve energy to replace them. City forester <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Giedraitis </PERSON> said Monday that <PERSON> Perot </PERSON>, who has pledged funds to help the tree, told him, `` Do n't worry about the bureaucracy, let's just do it.'' <PERSON> Perot </PERSON> has recommended using dechlorinated water to mist the tree's foliage, <PERSON> Giedraitis </PERSON> said. `` What we're trying to do is lower the stress on the tree ... When they -LRB- twigs -RRB- are cool, they're not under as much stress,'' he said. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Houser </PERSON>, head of a task force that gathered at the oak Monday and chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Austin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forestry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, said the experts would work to come up with a coherent plan of action. Task force members are from the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carolina </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> A & amp; M <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Edwards </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Consulting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arborists </ORGANIZATION>, the city and <ORGANIZATION> Du </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pont </ORGANIZATION>, maker of <LOCATION> Velpar </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Marine Biologists Fail To Move Dolphins To Ocean</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Marine biologists and the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> suspended efforts to herd two wayward dolphins out of the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> toward open water because the dolphins showed signs of stress. `` The dolphins were getting very excited,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Crawley </PERSON>, and the attempts to steer them down river were not working when they were halted Monday evening. Biologists and government officials were to meet today to discuss other methods to move the white-sided dolphins.

 Dynamite exploded in a passenger compartment of a train outside <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION>, killing at least 24 people and seriously injuring 11, official reports said today. An official of the city's <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> described Monday's blast as an accident. Western diplomats in <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION> said there was no indication it was linked to this month's military suppression of the pro-democracy movement. The national television news showed tape of a gaping hole in the side of the train from the explosion, which it said occurred in a toilet at the front of a third-class compartment. The inside of the train was severely damaged but there was no fire, reported the <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Kyodo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> China </ORGANIZATION>'s official <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> and government-run television said the blast was caused by dynamite but gave no details. The Foreign Affairs Office official said the blast occurred on a train bound for <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Hangzhou </LOCATION>, about 110 miles to the southwest. The official, who did not give his name, said an unknown number of passengers suffered minor injuries and 11 were seriously hurt. He said 24 people were killed in the blast. A local railroad official who identified himself only as <PERSON> Qi </PERSON> said he was uncertain how many people were on the train. But he said the capacity of the compartment where the blast occurred was 100 people. The television news showed Mayor <PERSON> Zhu </PERSON> <PERSON> Rongji </PERSON> at the crash site investigating the damage and talking to the injured. Explosions on Chinese trains are not uncommon. Sometimes they are the result of peasants carrying dynamite for their farms or fireworks for New Year celebrations. <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION> was the scene of major protests before soldiers killed hundreds of unarmed civilians in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> in crushing the pro-democracy movement. On June 6, six people were killed in <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION> when a train smashed through a barricade set up by demonstrators. Three men convicted of setting fire to the train after the crash were subsequently executed.

 Dad's Coffee Shop, where java in a plastic cup will cost you $ 2, has been fined $ 16,000 for using topless waitresses. Magistrate <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> E.V </PERSON>. <PERSON> Pieski </PERSON> on Monday cited <PERSON> Dad </PERSON>'s prices as evidence the adults-only business offers entertainment, for which it is not zoned. `` These are not waitresses who as a necessary and customary incident to the service of food are friendly. Their primary purpose and objective is to entertain by their nakedness and by their fraternization,'' <PERSON> Pieski </PERSON> said. The judge also cited <PERSON> Wasley </PERSON>'s newspaper ads: `` Noon to 6 p.m. _ Topless Colleen from <LOCATION> L.A. </LOCATION> -LRB- 38-24-34 -RRB-,'' read one. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Wasley </PERSON> said his business, which opened Feb. 15, will continue to use topless help while he appeals. The borough said it probably will seek additional fines. `` How can you really say when a girl serves you coffee that it's entertainment? <PERSON> Wasley </PERSON> asked. `` The question here is uniform. ... Where are they going to draw the line as to what's entertainment and what's dress?'' <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Siderowicz </PERSON>, who led a petition drive against <PERSON> Dad </PERSON>'s, said he will not be happy until the business closes. `` We do n't want this type of business in <LOCATION> Dickson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>,'' he said. `` This is small-town <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. It's bringing a bad type of people to <LOCATION> Dickson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>.'' About 1,100 of the borough's 6,700 residents signed a petition circulated outside churches opposing Dad's `` or any other enterprise of obscene nature.'' `` It's disgusting,'' Dad's regular <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Olszewski </PERSON> said of the ruling. `` A woman giggling is not entertaining.

 Gov. <PERSON> Norm </PERSON> <PERSON> Bangerter </PERSON> says the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Utah </ORGANIZATION>'s fusion experiments have gotten enough independent confirmation for the state to release $ 5 million for more research. However, the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> gave control of the $ 5 million to a fusion advisory committee, not the governor.

<HEAD>Defendant Seen Following Palme Just Before Killing</HEAD>
<DATELINE>STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The owner of a hot dog stand today testified that he saw the accused killer of Prime Minister <PERSON> Olof </PERSON> <PERSON> Palme </PERSON> behind the Swedish leader moments before the shooting. The testimony was one of the most damaging to the defendant, <PERSON> Christer </PERSON> <PERSON> Pettersson </PERSON>, since the trial began June 5. <PERSON> Pettersson </PERSON> has denied the killing. Kiosk owner <PERSON> Ljuvica </PERSON> <PERSON> Nadik </PERSON> said he noticed someone walking 10 to 15 feet behind <PERSON> Palme </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Lisbeth </PERSON>, down a street after they left a movie theater on Feb. 28, 1986. `` I'm certain this is the man who followed them,'' said <PERSON> Nadik </PERSON>, a Yugoslav immigrant who occasionally was helped by a translator. He remembered noticing that <PERSON> Palme </PERSON> had no security guards and feeling disappointed that the couple were simply dressed. Asked how he could identify <PERSON> Pettersson </PERSON> with certainty, <PERSON> Nadik </PERSON> said `` the image is very vivid with me. I've been reminded so many times. Every time I watch television or look through a newspaper and there has been something about the Palme murder, I have seen the image of the man who followed them,'' he said. A second witness, <PERSON> Anders </PERSON> <PERSON> Bjorkman </PERSON>, testified that he saw the shooting from a distance of about 15 yards, but he could not identify the gunman.

 <PERSON> Max </PERSON> <PERSON> Kowalski </PERSON> lived in the shadow of the swastika at <LOCATION> Auschwitz </LOCATION>, where the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION> were killing 10,000 Jews a day by 1945. His father, mother, sister and brother perished, but he survived _ until last weekend, when the shadow reappeared on the door of his boarding house room. Police say it was the work of a fellow boarder, an apparently unbalanced man with whom <PERSON> Kowalski </PERSON> had quarreled in the past. He went to the man's room to complain, and a fight ensued. When it was over <PERSON> Kowalski </PERSON>, 72, was dead on the floor in a puddle of blood. <PERSON> Ruben </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> <PERSON> Zucarino </PERSON>, 36, was charged with second degree murder. Detectives said he stabbed the old man repeatedly with a fork and scissors, and hit him over the head with a religious statue. He admitted having drawn the swastika, they said. `` <PERSON> Max </PERSON> survived a monster,'' said Rabbi <PERSON> Israel </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> of the state's human rights office. `` It's a shame he could n't survive a bite from a mosquito.'' <PERSON> Kowalski </PERSON>, a Polish Jew, came to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in 1949 and settled with many other Eastern European immigrants in the <LOCATION> Brighton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> section of <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION>. It was a simple but balanced life, built on rituals such as a chat with the card players under the trees in <LOCATION> Asser </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Levy </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> or a stroll along the boardwalk on the ocean. <PERSON> Kowalski </PERSON> lived with his wife in an apartment complex, but rented a room in a house near the beach as a combination hangout and workshop. He was a handyman who seemed to do half his work for free. `` He fixed a closet in my house once, but I could n't force the money on him,'' said <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Zukoff </PERSON>, a friend. `` He would do anything for you. I knew him 25 years _ a beautiful man.'' But a few months ago another room on the second floor of the boarding house was rented by <PERSON> Zucarino </PERSON>, with whom <PERSON> Kowalski </PERSON> quarreled over the condition of a kitchen area they shared. When <PERSON> Kowalski </PERSON>'s son <PERSON> Lenny </PERSON> went to visit his father on Saturday morning, he found a swastika and skull and crossbones written on the door with blue ink <PERSON> Kowalski </PERSON>, whose arm still bore the five-digit identification number which the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION> branded on him, had not noticed it, and he quietly cleaned the markings off his door. But as his son <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> later said, `` If somebody put a swastika up and you had numbers on tatooed on your arm, you would be upset.'' <PERSON> Kowalski </PERSON>'s friends were struck by the irony: to survive <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON>, the greatest villain in history, only to be killed a man whom they described as a garden variety anti-Semite. <LOCATION> Brighton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> is still a fairly safe neighborhood, but there have been other incidents. These immigrants, who have seen the worst the Old World had to offer, and wonder if the new one will turn out any better. `` We came here to live, not to fight with people,'' said <PERSON> Eva </PERSON> <PERSON> Uszerowicz </PERSON>, another <LOCATION> Auschwitz </LOCATION> survivor with numbers on her arm. But eventually the conversation kept coming back to <PERSON> Kowalski </PERSON>, and what a nice man he had been. The one thing everyone seemed to remember was his attendance at funerals. For a proper Jewish funeral, a quorum of 10 men is needed _ a minyan. Sometimes, when the deceased is particularly old or without family, 10 men are hard to come by. But <PERSON> Kowalski </PERSON> was always ready to drop whatever he was doing and go off to help form the minyan, whether he knew the deceased well or not. It was a mitzvah, a good deed. On Monday afternoon, at <PERSON> Kowalski </PERSON>'s own funeral, there was no problem with a minyan. About 200 people jammed into the funeral home. The congregation included <PERSON> Kowalski </PERSON>'s landlady, <PERSON> Tuey </PERSON> <PERSON> Chin </PERSON>, who sobbed throughout the service. In a city where landlords and tenants fight like Hatfields and McCoys, this was no small testament to <PERSON> Max </PERSON> <PERSON> Kowalski </PERSON>'s spirit. During World War II, `` six million people died because they were Jews,'' Rabbi <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Ziskind </PERSON> said in Yiddish. `` Today, you died because you're a Jew.''

<TEXT>
 Here is the text of President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s news conference Tuesday. I have a brief opening statement, and then I'd be glad to take questions. On Wednesday morning, the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> issued a decision which held that a person could not be convicted for desecration of our flag, the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> flag, and because to do so would infringe upon the right to political protest. Now, we've got to be very careful in our society to preserve the right to protest government action. However, I believe that the flag of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> should never be the object of desecration. Flag-burning is wrong. Protection of the flag, a unique national symbol, will in no way limit the opportunity nor the breadth of protest available in the exercise of free speech rights. And I have the greatest respect for the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, and indeed for the justices who interpreted the Constitution as they saw fit. But I believe the importance of this issue compels me to call for a constitutional amendment. Support for the First Amendment need not extend to desecration of the American flag. And we are reviewing proposed language for a constitutional amendment. We are beginning consultation with members of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> who hold similar views. And as president, I will uphold our precious right to dissent, but burning the flag goes too far, and I want to see that matter remedied. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON>? Q. Mr. <PERSON> President </PERSON>, when you were last with us, you said that you had tried to contact the leaders of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, and the line was busy; you were unable to get through. In light of the fact that there is now a new party secretary, have you renewed that try? And also, in light of what you just said, have you planned to ask Prime Minister <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Peng </PERSON> to return the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> cowboy boots with the American flag on it that you gave him in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>? A. I have no such plans. But _ and I hope he does n't ask for his bicycles back either. But in terms of contacts, we are trying, through our embassy, to have contacts. We have contact _ their ambassador has access to and contact with our officials here. And so there has been some exchange of views. But I have not, you know, renewed a phone call request, if that was your question. Q. As a follow-up, Mr. President, do you intend to go ahead and send a <ORGANIZATION> Peace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> team to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> in the fall to teach English, or will you go along with the <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> request that that be delayed?

Bunch on Monday recalled rushing into the burning house and groping through smoke on the second floor. `` I stepped and my leg hit something soft. I reached down and I felt someone's arm,'' he said.

 Hundreds of <LOCATION> Burmese </LOCATION> troops backed by mortar and artillery fire today attacked <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> guerrilla positions near the Thai border, <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> rebel sources said. Thai border patrol police said more than 50 mortar and artillery shells fell into <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>, and Burmese machine-gun fire hit three houses and a <ORGANIZATION> Buddhist </ORGANIZATION> temple in the border village of <LOCATION> Mae </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kone </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kane </LOCATION>. Thai police returned the fire, the border patrol said. Fierce fighting began before dawn as at least 800 government troops attacked the <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> base of <LOCATION> Pa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Loo </LOCATION>, about eight miles south of the <LOCATION> Thai </LOCATION> border town of <LOCATION> Mae </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sot </LOCATION>, said the guerrilla sources on condition of anonymity. Burmese troops pounded <PERSON> Pa </PERSON> <PERSON> Loo </PERSON> and the nearby camp at <LOCATION> Kaw </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Moo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ra </LOCATION> with hundreds of mortar and artillery rounds, they said. Both camps are separated from <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> by the <LOCATION> Moei </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>. No casualties were immediately reported. With about 8,000 armed fighters, the Karens are the largest of a dozen ethnic groups that have fought for more than four decades for greater autonomy from <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION>. Since December, government forces have seized five key guerrilla bases. The guerrillas claim they have killed up to 2,000 Burmese and wounded another 4,000 in the government offensive. Thai military sources said that up to June 15, about 185 Burmese troops were killed and at least 470 wounded in attacks on Pa Loo and Kaw Moo Ra that began in May. <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> casualties have been light, they said, with only six rebels reported dead and another 17 wounded. In an interview on Sunday at the Karen headquarters of <LOCATION> Manerplaw </LOCATION>, rebel commmander <PERSON> Bo </PERSON> <PERSON> Mya </PERSON> said that his fighters would revert to broader guerrilla actions against targets inside <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION> following the loss of key border positions. He dismissed suggestions that the rebels were near defeat, but other Karen officials based along the <LOCATION> Thai </LOCATION> border said the insurgency was at its lowest point ever. <PERSON> Bo </PERSON> <PERSON> Mya </PERSON> blamed recent Burmese successes on the economic boost <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> received from its trade ties with <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 A survey of more than 3,000 adults suggests that if there was a sexual revolution in the 1960s, most Americans missed it. The survey, conducted in 1970 but published this week for the first time, found that Americans overwhelmingly disapproved of prostitution, extramarital sex and premarital sex and were fiercely opposed to homosexuality. `` The number of women jumping in and out of bed at random is exaggerated, I think, just as the number of homosexuals in the population has been exaggerated,'' one of the study's authors, <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Levitt </PERSON>, a psychologist at the <ORGANIZATION> Indiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medicine </ORGANIZATION>, said in a telephone interview Monday. The survey, which could help researchers understand how AIDS spreads, was not released for so long because two of its authors fought over whose name should appear first on the title page, said <PERSON> Hubert </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Gorman </PERSON>, who edited the survey report to be published Thursday. The survey's other authors were <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Klassen </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dakota </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Colin </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Indiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University-Purdue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Indianapolis </LOCATION>. `` This is the first major study that dealt with the morality aspect'' of sexual behavior, said <PERSON> Levitt </PERSON>. `` And, by the way, it shows how bitterly anti-homosexual the American people are.'' More than two-thirds of respondents said homosexuals should not be allowed to be judges, teachers, ministers, doctors or government officials, <PERSON> Levitt </PERSON> said. The study, `` Sex and Morality in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION>,'' is the only survey of sex and morality taken in a representative sample of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> population before AIDS, said <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Turner </PERSON>, a sociologist and director of the committee on AIDS research at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION>. `` It's unique data that can not be reconstructed. It's of great historical interest,'' said <PERSON> Turner </PERSON>, who had prior access to the findings under a special arrangement with the <ORGANIZATION> Kinsey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> in Sex, Gender and Reproduction at <ORGANIZATION> Indiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. Among the findings: _ Extramarital sex was described as `` always wrong'' or `` almost always wrong'' by 87 percent of respondents _ Homosexual relations among people who do n't love each other were described the same way by 88 percent of the respondents Even among individuals who love each other, homosexual sex was disapproved of by 79 percent of respondents. _ Eighty-two percent disapproved of teen-age girls having premarital sex; 73 percent disapproved of teenage boys having premarital sex _ Seventy percent disapproved of adult premarital sex by women, and 65 percent disapproved of adult premarital sex by men Fewer respondents disapproved of sexual acts if the partners loved each other, `` leaving little doubt, therefore, that many respondents still cherished the ideal of love as a basis for sexual behavior,'' the authors said. `` These data will be indispensible to any attempt to describe the effects of AIDS on <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> sexual morality and behavior,'' <PERSON> O'Gorman </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Wesleyan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Middletown </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, said in an introduction to the survey. The survey had been nearly forgotten when researchers at the <ORGANIZATION> Kinsey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> began to search their files for information that could help explain the spread of AIDS, said <PERSON> June </PERSON> <PERSON> Reinisch </PERSON>, the institute's director. `` In the course of this search, we recognized the potential value of the unpublished 1970 survey data,'' she wrote in a preface to the book. <PERSON> Klassen </PERSON> took until 1979 to prepare the findings for publication. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> had been called in to speed the writing. Both demanded to be listed as the first author. Two years ago, <PERSON> Reinisch </PERSON> pushed a compromise in which <PERSON> Klassen </PERSON> was listed first and <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> was designated the official spokesman for the book. The data have already allowed <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> to estimate that in 1970 at least 20 percent of adult men had had homosexual contact at some time during their lives. `` We have n't had a good number for that,'' said <PERSON> Turner </PERSON>, adding that such numbers are critical to understanding the AIDS epidemic.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said today he would keep trying to get in touch with the leaders of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> but acknowledged he had not been able to make contact in the last few weeks. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, at a White House news conference, said he had still not received a telephone call from <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> despite his efforts to discuss the recent turmoil in the world's most populous nation. But <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said there have been `` some exchange of views'' at a lower level, And he stressed that the <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> ambassador here, <PERSON> Han </PERSON> <PERSON> Xu </PERSON>, has had easy access to senior <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> first disclosed his inability to make contact at a news conference last week. He appealed publicly for a show of clemency, but executions proceeded. In his remarks, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was mildly critical of moves by the Chinese to suspend <ORGANIZATION> Peace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> visits to the country. `` That's too bad,'' he said, `` One of the things that moved reform is contacts with Americans. I do n't want to see those contacts cut off.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> again avoided any heavy denunciation of the arrests and executions in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. `` I reiterate my desire not to do damage to the people themselves.'' He said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> contacts with <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> had promoted economic reform in the country. `` Someday we will move the process of political reform forward,'' he said. In the meantime, he said 30,000 Chinese now studying here will be `` going back there with a sense of what democracy and freedom is all about.'' He said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ties had helped <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> move out of a period of cultural isolation and that `` this relationship is important.'' Repeatedly, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said good relations with <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> are in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> interest. But he did not respond to two questions asking him to give specific examples. `` At this moment,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` it's impossible to have normal relations for very obvious reasons. But I am going to do my level best to find a way to see improvement there.'' And yet, the president said he could not `` dictate'' to the Chinese who should be leading the country. Since Army troops fired on students June 3-4 in Tiananmen Square the leadership of the government and the Communist party has been revised to remove leaders who showed some sympathy for democratic reform movements. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who headed the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> liaison office in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> and claims expertise in <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> affairs, said he could not have predicted the recent turn of events. But, he said, `` I guess the lesson is to go forward as best you can'' and `` to hold high the banner of values you believe in.'' Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, in a speech Monday night in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, was optimistic about long-term prospects for democracy. `` In <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>, as in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, a new order is taking shape,'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said in a speech summarizing <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> Administration policy on <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>. `` While the rites of passage will be painful _ <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> proves that _ it is an order full of promise and hope.'' `` We and some other nations have suspended business as usual,'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said. `` But we and the rest of the world must not let our revulsion at this repression blind us to pressure for reform.'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> spoke for 25 minutes before 1,000 guests at a black-tie dinner of the <ORGANIZATION> Asia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>, a private group dedicated to improving American understanding of <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>. He outlined a proposal for a new association of <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> countries to increase trade and investment and handle other regional issues ranging from cultural affairs to the environment. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said he plans to seek input on the form such an organization might take during a trip to <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> that starts July 3. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> will stop in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> to help plan multinational economic aid for the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Brunei </LOCATION>, he will attend the annual meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southeast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Asian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>, an economic organization of <LOCATION> Brunei </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s new foreign minister, <PERSON> Hiroshi </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitsuzuka </PERSON>, who met with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> earlier Monday, spoke at the dinner before <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>. He stressed the need for <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> `` to maintain a strong political, economic and military presence and commitment to the region.'' <PERSON> Mitsuzuka </PERSON> also called <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s `` path toward isolation'' regrettable and appealed to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s leaders to `` govern in a spirit of reconciliation and restraint.'' Meanwhile, 11 Americans were detained Monday by Chinese officials in <LOCATION> Kunming </LOCATION> and charged with distributing religious tracts, said <PERSON> Adam </PERSON> <PERSON> Shub </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman. The Americans were believed to be members of an evangelical Christian group, the <ORGANIZATION> Latter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rain </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Litchfield </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>. A <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> diplomat from the American consulate in <LOCATION> Chengdu </LOCATION> was investigating In the past, Americans who distributed religious tracts have been fined and asked to leave.

 <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> John </PERSON>, something might be happening in some department today that I know nothing about. We've got an enormous bureaucracy. We've got a tremendous bureaucracy that extends all around the world And there might well be some corruption out there that's going on that I would be responsible for, but that I do n't know about. But I am not going to try to assign blame; I want to look to the future. And that's the way I'm going to handle that one. Yeah, <PERSON> Lesley </PERSON>? Q. Mr. <PERSON> President </PERSON>, you've spoken out emotionally, obviously, about the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>'s decision on the flag. I wonder if you'd like to take this chance to speak out emotionally on their affirmative action decisions, which make it harder for women and minorities to sue for discrimination? A. I'm not sure that I agree with your _ the hypothesis of your question. As I said at a _ the last press conference, formal press conference _ I was going to ask our attorney general and our general counsel to look into this matter. And I am strongly committed to equal opportunity for all Americans. And I am advised that nothing in these decisions jeopardizes that principle or calls into question affirmative action or minority outreach efforts. This was _ this is the opinion of the attorney general, who, I understand, will be speaking on this at noon today. The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> has told me that the decision reflects interpretation of the civil rights laws by the court on technical subjects, and we're talking about burdens of proof and statutes of limitations. But, that is the advice I am getting, and I will certainly support the attorney general. Q. All right. Constitutional scholars say, for instance, that if a minority student is _ faces racial harassment at school, at private schools _ they are no longer covered. There are some situations where people can not sue for racial harassment, for instance, and there are other sort of niggling things, but it's really the question of your emotional response, because you jump out of the box on the flag A. I have just given it to you. Affirmative action I've _ you know my position on that: commitment to equal opportunity. I hope people know my commitment on that, but we're getting into a technicality that neither you or I are competent to discuss. And I am going _ you are going on the advice of who you call `` legal scholars,'' and I'm going on the advice of the attorney general and a very fine general counsel. So, I think we have a difference on the interpretation of what this means, and I've seen that some of the civil rights leaders disagree. But, I am committed, and if the decisions actually turn out to hamper civil rights enforcement, along the lines you're talking about, obviously I would want to take steps to remedy the situation. Q. But are you saying you wo n't support legislation ... A. Is this your third question. Come on, <PERSON> Lesley </PERSON>. Q. I'm sorry. A. Go ahead. Q. Are you saying you wo n't support legislation that ... A. I'm saying that my advice from the attorney general is that legislation is n't necessary. Back here in the middle. Yeah. Q. Mr. President, you've expressed your strong feelings again on this <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> decision on the flag burning, but the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> is expected to make a decision this week on the abortion issue, which is among the most emotional in the country. And I wonder, going into that decision, if you view your role as a healer after this decision, as simply to enforce the law? What is your view, going into that decision as the president, and this very important emotional issue? A. It is an emotional issue. And I am firmly positioned in favor of, you know, overturn of Roe-Wade. And that's my position, and I'm not going to change that position But I do n't want to see it _ the divisiveness that that whole issue causes _ split this country. And yet the decision is going to be _ I do n't know what they're going to decide. But my position on it is very clear. <PERSON> Owen </PERSON>. Q. During the campaign, you came out many times for a constitutional amendment to balance the budget. I'm curious why now you've moved so quickly to call for a constitutional amendment concerning flag-burning, which is solely a symbolic issue, and yet you have n't moved at all on balancing the budget in terms of a constitutional amendment, which is substantive and which a lot of people in this country think would accomplish a lot more for the economy. Can you explain that? A. Yeah _ oh, easily. Let me take this opportunity to make a clarion call for a balanced budget amendment. Absolutely. It has to be phased in, but I'd like to see it. Q. Why do you have to be prompted to do that? Why do you give such a high priority ... A. Because my position is so well-known on it, <PERSON> Owen </PERSON>. Q. Why do you give such a high priority to the issue of flag-burning, and you have n't said anything until now about a balanced budget amendment? A. I said a lot about it all last year. I thought you got tired of hearing it. But I will repeat it. And _ but if you want to know, I've got to confess, I do feel viscerally about burning the American flag. And I do n't _ and therefore, I express it. And I feel viscerally about fiscal sanity, also. But this decision just came down and it is one that causes, I think, the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people, and certainly this president, great concern. And I think it can be remedied without doing violence to a person's right to protest. Yeah, <PERSON> David </PERSON>, and then <PERSON> Charles </PERSON>. Q. Mr. <PERSON> President </PERSON>, you're going to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> in a few weeks, and I wonder, a lot's happened since your <LOCATION> Hamtramck </LOCATION> speech; we've had free elections, Solidarity now may have a much bigger role in what happens in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. When you go, are you interested in bringing some expanded debt relief, financial aid? <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> has been saying to the world that he really needs help now. Do you think you are in a position to bring it?

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> today said the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> knows `` we want to move forward'' on a nuclear weapons reduction treaty and applauded <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> for visiting <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. The president spoke to reporters a day after five former secretaries of state and defense urged the administration to push for the treaty but warned that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> does not know enough about <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> intentions `` to justify extraordinary political or economic concessions.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he had no timetable for a first summit meeting with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> but said such a meeting did not need to wait for a major treaty agreement between the superpowers. `` I do n't think it should be something to sign, but I'd like to think that the governing criterion would be that the world would see the meeting as successful, something good coming out of it,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, speaking in general terms about arms negotiations with the Soviets, said `` they know we want to move forward with START,'' an acronym for Strategic Arms Reduction Talks. `` I feel comfortable,'' about the pace of improvements in U.S-Soviet ties, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, adding that a number of medical and cultural exchanges had helped improve the relationship. `` We're coming closer on some of these broad, broad-scale objectives,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` All I want to say is I think the relationship is going in the right general direction albeit we have tremendous differences with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> still.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> applauded <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s recent visits to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> and said he did not expect the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> `` to be uptight'' about his upcoming visit to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, a <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact ally of the Soviets. `` Mr. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> goes to <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and he is well received; I will go to <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and I will be well received,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. The report released Monday and signed by the five secretaries and six other ex-officials also counseled <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to show restraint on developing space-based defenses. It concluded that <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> is more inclined than any of his predecessors to reach accords with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> that further Western interests. But it added that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> knowledge of current and future <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> policy was `` too problematical to justify extraordinary political or economic concessions which we would otherwise not consider.'' <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Schlesinger </PERSON>, secretary of defense in the <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> administration, criticized the Soviet leader for agreeing last week to resume arms aid to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. He said it showed <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> is still seeking `` marginal advantage'' over the West and in that respect `` failing the test.'' Still, the report urged the administration to push hard to complete the treaty to reduce long-range bombers, missiles and submarines by 30 to 50 percent. After a seven-month recess, the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration resumed negotiations last week in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>. At the same time, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and its <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> allies are negotiating with the <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pact </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> to reduce troops, tanks, artillery and other non-nuclear armories in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. The report said completion of a strategic arms reduction treaty `` will make it easier for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and its allies to obtain large and asymmetrical reductions in conventional arms, and should not wait on success in the latter.'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> already has made `` especially significant'' commitments to cut more men and arms than the West and to shift the role of Soviet troops toward defense, the report said. `` I do worry,'' said <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, who was secretary of defense in the <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> administration, `` if START is pushed to the back burner it will not get done at all. That would be a big mistake.'' <PERSON> Schlesinger </PERSON> and <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, who held a joint news conference, were joined in the report by former <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Melvin </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Laird </PERSON> and former Secretaries of State <PERSON> Cyrus </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Vance </PERSON> and <PERSON> Edmund </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Muskie </PERSON>. The other ex-officials who issued the report were <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Abshire </PERSON>, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Blumenthal </PERSON>, <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hartman </PERSON>, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Helms </PERSON>, <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Peterson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Watson </PERSON>. On space-based defenses, they said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> should be willing to recommit itself for 10 years to the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty and discuss with the Soviets what kind of tests for a space-based defense are permitted. This could have the effect of constraining the program undertaken by former President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> to develop a shield against Soviet ballistic missiles combining sophisticated technology and nuclear weapons in space. However, the report also suggested the 1972 treaty could be amended or a new one concluded with the Soviets through negotiations.

But I called <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, the chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, to thank him over the weekend for his stance in the <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> in terms of support for <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. And so we will have a package that I'm not prepared to discuss now in detail, that I hope will help. I know this will be a subject of great concern after my Polish _ the visit to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> in the _ in our summit, economic summit meeting. But the problem is, we would like very much to help <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. I am very encouraged with what's happened in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. But I want to be sure that when we do offer the specifics and the specific plan to help <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, that <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> itself takes, will have taken, the steps necessary to have the money well spent. I do n't want to just push money down, down the drain. So I think along with what we can offer there will have to come from their side some reforms. And that, I want to talk to General <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON> about, and obviously <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>, and we'll see where we go. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON>, and then <PERSON> John </PERSON> here. Q. Let me follow on the <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> question. Both there and in <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, you're entering countries that are in a transition at a very delicate situation politically, and vis-a-vis their own allies. What cautions do you take and do you exercise going in there so as not to be a negative catalyst? A. I think being there is the significant thing. It is important that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> show its interest in these countries that are undergoing change. You do n't want to over-exhort. You do n't want to over-promise. You do n't want to rally people to levels of political activity that might cause repression. And so what I want to do is make clear where the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> stands in terms of our respect for freedom, encourage reform as much as possible, and then _ back to <PERSON> David </PERSON>'s question _ offer some specifics where we can help on the economy. Our _ my views on differentiation have not changed over the last few years. We will differentiate. We will support those that move towards us economically, politically and in terms of human rights. And it's more on those general themes that I will be talking to the Hungarian leaders and the Polish leaders. Q. If I could follow. A. Yes. Q. Do you send any signal at the same time to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>? Or have you had any communication to them about the purposes of your visit? A. No, but I would not expect them to be uptight about it. Mr. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> goes to <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and is well-received. And I will go to <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and I will be well-received. And I think it was a good thing, his trip to <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. I've talked to Chancellor <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> about it personally. And I do n't get all into some state of competition when I see Mr. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> get a good, warm response in <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION> is together. One of the things that came out of the <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> summit meeting was the fact that there is strong unity there. And so it's a good thing for him to go to <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, and it's a good thing for the president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to go to <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. And I want to see us move beyond containment. I want to see a much more open <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. And I think that this _ so the importance of the visit is along that line. And it's not going to be that we're going to solve the problem of the Hungarian economy or the Polish economy. <PERSON> John </PERSON>? Q. Let me ask another question about abortion and <PERSON> Roe </PERSON> versus <PERSON> Wade </PERSON>. We may get that decision this week. Now, I understand your position: you're for a constitutional amendment regardless of which way the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> rules. A. I've, yeah, I've already ... Q. Is that right? Now, if the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> strikes down <PERSON> Roe </PERSON> versus <PERSON> Wade </PERSON> and sends this back to the states, would it not be less divisive to let the states decide this rather than go through the whole long, tortuous process of a constitutional amendment? <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> John </PERSON>, I hate to not respond to your question, but the court is probably going to make a decision very soon, and I would prefer to address myself to the question after the court has decided. Q. It is still your position, though, sir, that you favor a constitutional amendment regardless? A. I've positioned it _ my position on that abortion question has not changed. Yeah? Q. Mr. President, you'll soon be proposing some campaign financing reforms. What is it about the current system of campaign financing that makes you think some kind of broad reform is required? And if broad reform is important, why not go ahead and go all the way to public financing of campaigns, or some kind of a limit on overall spending on congressional campaigns?

<TEXT>
 Officials are checking <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> allegations that a West German company was involved in the sale of chemicals aimed at producing poison gas for <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> confirmed today. West German officials also had asked <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> to recall a Bonn-based diplomat allegedly linked to the suspected chemicals deal but he had already left the country, the ministry said. A ministry spokesman, <PERSON> Hans </PERSON> <PERSON> Schumacher </PERSON>, said the request to have the diplomat recalled was based on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> information about his suspected links to the chemicals purchase. `` The person in question has not worked at the -LRB- Iranian -RRB- Embassy for some time and will not resume his duties there,'' <PERSON> Schumacher </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Schumacher </PERSON> did not say when the Iranian diplomat was asked to leave or identify him by name. Informed sources in <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION>, who requested anonymity, identified him as <PERSON> Seyed </PERSON> <PERSON> Karim </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Sobhani </PERSON>. Another <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman confirmed that federal officials are taking steps to investigate the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> allegations. `` We were informed by the Americans about this last week,'' said <PERSON> Rainer </PERSON> <PERSON> Mueller </PERSON>, a ministry spokesman for <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> affairs. <PERSON> Mueller </PERSON> was replying to a query about a report in <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> today that a <LOCATION> Duesseldorf </LOCATION> company had acted as a broker to sell of tons of thionyl chloride to a manufacturer in <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>. The chemical can be used to make mustard gas, and was intended for use by <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, the report said. It said the bulk of the chemicals was not delivered. `` We have notified the appropriate departments to take the necessary steps'' for an investigation, <PERSON> Mueller </PERSON> said in a telephone interview. <PERSON> Mueller </PERSON> declined to name the company being investigated. The Iranian diplomat, <PERSON> Sobhani </PERSON>, was allegedly involved in the case of a West German national who was arrested in July 1988 in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for attempting to ship thiodiglycol, a precursor for mustard gas, to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> via <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Karachi </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>. The West German, <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Walaschek </PERSON>, later pleaded guilty to violating <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> export laws and said he purchased the chemicals at the request of <PERSON> Sobhani </PERSON>. <PERSON> Walaschek </PERSON> fled a halfway house where he was confined, and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials said in May that they believe he returned to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. Late last year, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials accused West German firms of helping <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> to build a chemical weapons plant south of <LOCATION> Tripoli </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> said the plant was to make pharmaceuticals, not weapons. Following a lengthy investigation, officials arrested <PERSON> Juergen </PERSON> <PERSON> Hippenstiel-Imhausen </PERSON>, the former head of <ORGANIZATION> Imhausen-Chemie </ORGANIZATION> company, in connection with the Libyan deal. His case is still pending.

<HEAD>Court Lets Stand Ruling That CBS Lost Trademark for Show</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> today let stand a ruling that <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> no longer enjoys trademark protection for the `` Amos ` N' Andy'' radio and television shows The justices, without comment, refused to review a federal appeals court ruling that <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> abandoned the trademarks when, under pressure from civil rights groups, it suspended commercial use of the shows. The asserted trademarks were challenged by <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Silverman </PERSON>, who wants to produce a musical play based on the `` Amos ` N' Andy'' shows and their characters. The case now returns to a federal judge in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, who is to rule on other aspects of the dispute. Today's high court action does not remove all legal hurdles confronting <PERSON> Silverman </PERSON>. The characters of <PERSON> Amos </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> and <PERSON> Andy </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> were created in 1928 by <PERSON> Freeman </PERSON> <PERSON> Gosden </PERSON> and <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Correll </PERSON>, who wrote and produced the `` Amos ` N' Andy'' radio program, one of the nation's most popular. <PERSON> Gosden </PERSON> and <PERSON> Correll </PERSON> were white, but <PERSON> Amos </PERSON> and <PERSON> Andy </PERSON> and all other characters portrayed on the program were black. <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> bought all rights to the show and its creations in 1948, and broadcast it until 1955. In 1951, <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> began broadcasting an `` Amos ` N' Andy'' television show using black actors. The television series also attained great popularity, and a generation of TV viewers came to know <PERSON> George </PERSON> `` Kingfish'' <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>; his wife, <PERSON> Sapphire </PERSON>; lawyer <PERSON> Algonquin </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Calhoun </PERSON> and the Mystic Knights of the Sea Lodge. The television show was aired on <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> affiliate stations until 1953. It continued in reruns and non-network syndication until 1966, when <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> responded to criticism that the show presented a demeaning portrayal of blacks. <PERSON> Silverman </PERSON> in 1981 asked CBS for permission to produce a play based on a script called `` Amos ` N' Andy Go To the Movies.'' The play's proposed title later was changed to `` Amos ` N' Andy In <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION>,'' and finally to `` Fresh Air Taxi.'' <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> refused permission, and <PERSON> Silverman </PERSON> sued in 1984. The suit alleged that <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> had no trademark or other exclusive rights in the material contained in the first 20 years of <ORGANIZATION> Amos </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> ` </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> N </ORGANIZATION>' Andy radio shows <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Goettel </PERSON> ruled for <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> on the trademark issue. He said the network offered a reasonable explanation for its decision to keep the programs off the air and asserted its intention to resume use at some indefinite future date. But the 2nd U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> last Feb. 6 reversed that ruling. The appeals court said the trial judge misinterpeted the federal trademark law's handling of abandonment. `` More likely, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> wanted a mark to be deemed abandoned once use has been discontinued with an intent not to resume within the reasonably foreseeable future,'' the appeals court said. In the appeal acted on today, lawyers for <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> said other appeals courts have ruled that `` an outside cause for suspension of use of a trademark precludes abandonment.'' The case is <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> vs. <PERSON> Silverman </PERSON>, 88-1804.

<HEAD>Socialist Mandate To Form Coalition Government Fails</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATHENS, Greece (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Ailing Premier <PERSON> Andreas </PERSON> <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON> today failed to gain communist support in forming a coalition government that would lead <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> out of a nine-day political deadlock. Negotiations between the premier's <ORGANIZATION> Panhellenic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION> and the communist-led Coalition of the Left and Progress ended at noon without an agreement. <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON> was forced to appoint a representative to negotiate on his behalf. The 70-year-old premier was admitted to <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday with pneumonia he contracted eight months after undergoing heart surgery. Hospital officials said he developed heart and kidney complications Sunday and was on a dialysis machine for three hours. A medical bulletin issued by his doctors today said he was `` continually improving.'' <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON> is heading a caretaker government because no party received a majority in elections on June 18 to the 300-seat Parliament. <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Harilaos </PERSON> <PERSON> Florakis </PERSON> said Tuesday that the socialist proposals `` were equally interesting'' as those made to him last week by the conservatives, who finished first in the elections but failed to build a coalition. <PERSON> Florakis </PERSON> did not disclose the proposals. The conservative <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democracy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> had proposed a government in which the leftists would control the justice and interior ministries. <PERSON> Florakis </PERSON> said that he would hold meetings with conservative and socialist representatives on Wednesday, when his alliance begins attempts to build a coalition government. It appeared that the <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION> had little chance of leading an alliance with either the support of the Socialists or the conservatives. If the three major parties can not form a coalition government, new elections will be called.

<HEAD>Recator Accident May Have Contaminated Soviet Submarine</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DOUG MELLGREN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>OSLO, Norway (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A leak in the nuclear power system of a Soviet submarine probably contaminated the vessel but not the environment, a Norwegian expert said today. The submarine, built in the 1960s, billowed smoke and steam when its reactor's cooling system broke down Monday, 70 miles from the coast of northern <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION>. Soviet officials say there was no radiation leak. They say the reactor was shut down and no one was injured. But <PERSON> Knut </PERSON> <PERSON> Gussgard </PERSON>, acting chairman of <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> on Peacetime Nuclear Accidents, said pieced-together details of the accident aboard the Echo-II Class submarine show a reactor cooling circuit most likely leaked radioactive water and steam into the vessel. Gussgard, from the Norwegian <ORGANIZATION> Nuclear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION>, said by telephone that too little information is available to judge the effect of such radiation on the crew. Just before Monday's accident, submarine Capt. <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ovisjinnkov </PERSON> was quoted as telling the Soviet publication <LOCATION> Smena </LOCATION> that <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> nuclear submarine crews are poorly trained, know little about procedures and can handle fewer than half the situations they should master. It was the second Soviet submarine accident in three months. On April 7, an advanced Mike Class nuclear submarine sank 207 miles away in the <LOCATION> Norwegian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION>. Forty-two Soviet sailors died. No radiation was reported. Last week, the Soviet cruise liner Maxim Gorky rammed the ice pack off <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION>. None of the 950 passengers were hurt. <PERSON> Johan </PERSON> <PERSON> Baarli </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION>'s Institude for Radiation Hygiene, said preliminary water and air tests show no radiation from the Echo II accident. `` But the tests would not measure radiation aboard ship,'' <PERSON> Baarli </PERSON> said in an interview. Reports said that with its reactor being kept cool with fresh water pumped from a Soviet escort vessel, the damaged submarine was sailing toward its home port in the northern <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. `` We do n't like the idea of them having to cool the reactor with water from another ship. Even with the reactor shut down, if it loses all cooling the afterheat of the reactor could be enough to cause problems,'' said <PERSON> Gussgard </PERSON>. Officials of this <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> member nation have criticized <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s slowness in warning them of potential danger and express concern about general safety of Soviet submarines <LOCATION> Oslo </LOCATION>'s Defense Minister <PERSON> Johan </PERSON> <PERSON> Joergen </PERSON> <PERSON> Holst </PERSON> called Monday for a special agreement requiring the Soviets to inform <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION> of dangerous situations near its coast. A Soviet Embassy spokesman told the newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Dagbladet </ORGANIZATION> today that the Soviets regretted the delay but had not considered the accident threatening enough to warrant a warning. <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION> is concerned that 100 nuclear submarines operating out of the <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fleet </ORGANIZATION> base on the <LOCATION> Kola </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peninsula </LOCATION>, just over <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION>'s northern border, may be dangerous even in peacetime. The submarines, including about 30 of the older Echo II design, regularly pass through and patrol a narrow, strategically important corridor to the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> that follows <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION>'s coast, a Norwegian defense spokesman said.

<HEAD>WASHINGTON: congressional campaigns?</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 A. I oppose public financing of these campaigns. I think people should be able to attract private support, and I think participation by individuals in the political process through financial support is very, very important. I do n't want to see eroding out, the eroding out of participation by Americans in the political process. So, I'm opposing, I will oppose and have opposed the public financing of all of these campaigns Now, there are proposals that I'm not prepared to discuss in detail, though I see others have already started dicussing what I might do on Thursday. I will have specific proposals, but _ and I think they'll be fairly far-reaching, because I want to see reform, real reform, and they'll be good proposals. But I'm not prepared to go into what I'm going to do now except to say, I will not support kicking the citizen out of the political process by saying hat a citizen can not financially support the candidate of his or her choice. Q. So if I could follow-up. If the broad outlines of what you are going to do as reported are correct, there's going to be some accusations that they help Republicans more than Democrats. How are you going to respond ... A. Why would anyone make a charge like that against me when I'm looking at it as objectively as I can Let's wait till you see what the _ what it, what it, what the proposals are. I mean, I would be outraged by a suggestion of that nature. Yeah? Q. You and Mr. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> are touring each other's back yards in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. And now that you've finished your foreign policy reviews with regard to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, have you moved any closer to perhaps meeting with the general secretary? A. That _ I would n't say `` closer.'' That matter will be discussed again. It's having been discussed once by the secretary and Foreign Minister <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>. But I _ so I guess I'd, I'd leave it right there. There will, obviously at some point, be a meeting, but I still feel I'd like the meeting to be seen as productive rather than just the meeting itself. But I _ let me say this. I feel comfortable about the wavelength we're on with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> now and I think they feel comfortable in the sense that I think they know we want to move forward with START. They know that we are prepared to move swiftly forward with the conventional force, rectifying the conventional force imbalance and indeed, I got the feeling from talking to Chancellor <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> that Mr. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> was not hung up on the timetable that we set. So, we're coming closer on some of these broad, broad scale objectives and then there are some very nice smaller things, their help, that Soviet ship helping with the cleanup; and our kids from <PERSON> Brooks </PERSON> going over to help with the burn _ our specialized burn unit, really qualified people, the best in helping with burns, going to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, and then the outreach at the time of <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION>. So, there are some atmospherics that I think are very, very important and harmonious that will help when we sit down to hammer out the details on the strategic arms talks or on these other matters. Q. Could I ask you, to follow up, to perhaps define a little bit more what `` useful'' or `` progress'' would be in terms of a meeting? Are you setting a precondition, as President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> did, that you need something to sign? Or is there ... A. No, I do n't think it should be something to sign, but I would like to think that the criterion, the governing criterion, would be so that the world would see the meeting as having been successful, something good happening out of it. And it does n't have to be signing necessarily, although, I've been around this track long enough to know that you can always whip out something to sign, a fishing agreement or something of this nature. But, so we could have that, but I'm not saying that we _ that it should be hung up on a major treaty of some sort before I would sit down with Mr. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. Maybe we'll do it like this: say, `` Hey, let's get together.'' And, I'm interested in what he thinks about it. And we've had some communication back and forth. But all I want to say is I think the relationship is going in the right general direction, albeit we have tremendous differences with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> still _ and I still have _ guided by a certain sense of caution. Over here and then up here. Q. Mr. President, you made much during the campaign and after your election of your relationship with <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s leaders and, yet, for the past several weeks, been unable to contact them. And <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> appears to have ignored our calls for clemency and for dialogue. Sir, do you not think the relationship was oversold? A. No, I do n't think it was oversold. Q. Then tell us what benefit we've gained from it.

<TEXT>
 The remnants of Tropical Storm <PERSON> Allison </PERSON> battered the Gulf Coast today with torrential rain, sending streams and bayous over their banks, turning roads into canals and killing at least one person. Before it was downgraded to a tropical depression early today, the first named storm of the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> hurricane season also was blamed for the partial collapse of the roof at <LOCATION> Northline </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mall </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> and for the capsizing of a tugboat in <LOCATION> Galveston </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>. No serious injuries were reported in those incidents. The slow-moving storm swept ashore Monday about 60 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>. Forecasters said rainfall eventually might be measured in feet. `` We hope it wo n't become a reality but it is a possibility,'' <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Stagno </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>. No relief was expected until late today because the system was moving so slowly _ only 6 mph to the north. During the morning rush hour, high water closed both major highways into <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> from the north, and freeway underpasses and service roads were littered with abandoned vehicles. `` It's a helpless feeling,'' said stranded motorist <PERSON> Miles </PERSON> <PERSON> Nye </PERSON>. `` There's nothing you can do. You just watch the water moving up.'' Some underpasses had as much as 15 or 20 feet of water. An empty city bus stuck in an underpass near downtown was barely visible in the water. At 5 a.m., the poorly defined center of the depression was about 50 miles north of <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>. Maximum sustained winds dropped to 35 mph with 45 mph gusts along the eastern Texas-western <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> coast, the National Hurricane Center in <LOCATION> Coral </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gables </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, said. Maximum sustained winds must be at least 39 mph for a depression to be a named tropical storm. More than 10 inches of rain fell in the <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> area during the 24 hours that ended early today, the weather service said. `` The main thing is the rain,'' said meteorologist <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Vannozzi </PERSON>. `` It's a heavy rainmaker. The heavy rain and flooding extended into southwestern <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>, where a tornado overturned trailers in rural Hackberry today. In <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, authorities reported a tornado Monday evening at <LOCATION> Smithpoint </LOCATION> and Double Bayou. The storm was blamed for the fatal traffic accident of a 46-year-old <LOCATION> Port </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Neches </LOCATION> man Monday evening, police said. Rain fell at an inch per hour in some areas and deluges were expected to continue today into east <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and southwest <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>. Hardest hit areas were along the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> coast although damage appeared to be minor, confined to downed power lines and some roof shingles blown away. Damage from high water also was reported. Flash-flood warnings were in effect for the coastal counties south of <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> while the rest of southeast <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> was under a flash-flood watch. `` It's starting to come up pretty fast,'' <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Best </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Danbury </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Brazoria </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, said as his family tried to save household belongings from rising waters. `` We're trying to put our furniture up as fast as we can.'' In east <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>, fire department airboats were used to evacuate dozens of residents of two apartment complexes bordering a bayou. `` It does n't look like there's going to be any relief,'' fireman <PERSON> Lester </PERSON> <PERSON> Tyra </PERSON> said. `` The only way out is with an airboat.'' <PERSON> Allison </PERSON> was upgraded to a tropical storm Monday morning. The storm had its origins in Hurricane Cosme, which moved from the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> across <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> last week. The <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> hurricane season runs from June to November.

 Authorities today released two American and two West German pilots 10 days after they were detained and questioned for flying over restricted airspace, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and West German diplomats said. `` I can confirm that the four pilots ... were unconditionally released on Tuesday,'' said a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Embassy official who can not be identified under briefing rules. The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> has identified the Americans as <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Haile </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Carson </PERSON> <PERSON> Gilmore </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Rocksprings </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 A national student group said today it will defy a government ban and march to communist <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> to attend a youth festival. Other students hurled rocks and firebombs at riot police on two campuses Monday. Official <ORGANIZATION> Yonhap </ORGANIZATION> news agency said 15 students were arrested. The chairman of the radical <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Student </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Representatives </ORGANIZATION> told a news conference he expects 15,000 students to congregate at <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Hanyang </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> for a march Friday, the eve of the festival. `` We've not given up hope to go to <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>,'' said Im Chong-suk. The World Youth Festival will be held in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s capital, <LOCATION> Pyongyang </LOCATION>, July 1-8. Prosecutors confirmed they issued warrants Monday for the arrest of Im and two other leaders of the radical student group, charging them with violating the National Security Law by talking on the telephone with North Korean students. The law forbids communication with people in an `` anti-state'' body. Im was undeterred. He said South Korean students plan to draft a joint communique with North Korean students and, if they can not get to <LOCATION> Pyongyang </LOCATION>, details will be arranged through third countries using telephones and facsimile machines. Students holding valid passports and those studying overseas are being encouraged to try to get to <LOCATION> Pyongyang </LOCATION> through third countries, he said. The <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> government says any who attend without notifying the government or a South Korean Embassy can be prosecuted. <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> accuses <LOCATION> Pyongyang </LOCATION> of using the festival to stir up dissident movements in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> _ a charge the Noth Korean government denies. The festival is a political and sports event attended mostly by youths from the Third World and communist bloc. At <ORGANIZATION> Hanyang </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> Monday, fighting erupted when 200 students screaming anti-government slogans and hurling rocks and firebombs attacked riot police blocking campus gates. About 500 visored police ringed the campus and stopped outsiders from entering. Student leaders said some students from the provinces already were inside. In provincial <LOCATION> Taegu </LOCATION> city, police fired tear gas to disperse 500 students from three schools who attacked them with firebombs and rocks outside <ORGANIZATION> Yongnam </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, according to <ORGANIZATION> Yonhap </ORGANIZATION>. The South Korean agency said 15 students were arrested. South and <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> have been bitter rivals since their land was divided at the end of World War II. <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> invaded the south in 1950 and the three-year Korean War left more than l million dead on both sides. A truce was never signed and enmity deepened.

<HEAD>WASHINGTON: was oversold.</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 A. What we've gained is, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> has a much more open economic system than when the <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION> communique was signed quite a few years ago. What we've gained is 30,000 students right this minute, I think the figure is, studying in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Chinese kids going back there with a sense of what freedom and democracy is all about. What we have gained is helping <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> move out of a period of Cultural Revolution isolation. And this relationship is important. And I can continue to express my outrage about what happened in <LOCATION> Tiananmen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION>. But _ and I will _ but I am determined to do my level best to keep from injuring the very people that we're trying to help, and I'm talking about the Chinese people generally. So we've gained a lot from this relationship, and so have they. And I still think that it is in the strategic interest of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. I'm not talking about the old adage of playing the <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> card or something of that nature, or playing the Soviet card. But if you look at the world and you understand the dynamics of the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> area, good relationships with <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> are in the national interest of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Now, it's hard to have them. It's impossible at this moment to have what I would say are normalized relations, for various, very obvious reasons. But I am going to do my level best to find a way to see improvement there that will help the <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> people. Q. If I could follow, sir. A. Please. Q. It's your personal relationship with <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s leaders that I'm speaking of I'm looking for the benefit when you can not even complete a phone call to <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaoping </PERSON>. I'm wondering if the personal relationship is ... A. The benefit is, I understand the situation. That's the benefit. And leaders are changing all the time over there, so _ I mean recently _ so we've got to deal with who is there. We do n't dictate to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> about their leaders We express our concerns, as other leaders have. But let me be very clear. In my view, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has been out front, we've been out front on the steps we've taken And I am very pleased that there has been broad support for the position I have taken. And I heard it just today from the prime minister of <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>, one of the most knowledgeable men about <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. The Australians, you see, have always had a _ they've had, been a little out front. They've had relations before we did. And they have a rather, almost a unique standing in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>; they've done a lot of business with <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. They've worked _ they've had a lot of exchanges with <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Hawke </PERSON> feels that he knows most of the Chinese leaders, the ones that we had been dealing with. And to hear him say _ be as supportiv as he was today _ was very reassuring to me. Yeah? Q. Mr. President, how concerned are you ... A. Yes, <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON>, you're next. Q. How concerned are you that the retreat _ the political retreat that we've seen in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> in recent weeks _ could be duplicated in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>? A. Well, I did not predict what would happen in Tiananmen Square and I do n't know of any <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> expert, scholar or otherwise, who predicted that. And I guess the lesson is go forward as best you can, keep your eyes open, hold high the banner of values that we believe in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. We have a special responsibility around the world in terms of human rights and democracy, freedom. But keep your eyes open. That's what I've learned from this. Q. Have you had any communications with Secretary <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> on the situation in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>? A. Not on <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. Maybe others in the administration _ not <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> personally, but I've followed carefully the statements out of there and, obviously, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has tried to, with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s visit to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, tried to improve relations. But I think that's on a little bit of a hold, although maybe they're more accommodating than we are right now. Yeah, <PERSON> Jessica </PERSON>? Q. Mr. <PERSON> President </PERSON>, women's groups have been very pleasantly surprised and saluting you for your statements yesterday about violence, crimes against women and spousal abuse. And a couple have asked the question whether you will be willing to take that message to men's groups _ one said those `` macho groups'' _ such as the <ORGANIZATION> NRA </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Legion </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chiefs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>, and ask them to stop _ to get the word out to stop beating their wives and stop beating _ the generic thing, not specific. A. Hey listen, I'm a member of the <ORGANIZATION> NRA </ORGANIZATION>. You're hurting my feelings, as they say in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. Q. And the question is whether you will take the message to men's groups, instead of to the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Women </ORGANIZATION> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jessica </PERSON>, I hope that the message that _ because of the line of work you all are engaged in _ I hope that message got to every group. But I do n't want to single out or acquiesce in a hypothesis here and.. Q But you did say ... A. Say that the <ORGANIZATION> NRA </ORGANIZATION> is against women or the other groups you singled out? Q. But you spoke _ you talked about ... A. Come on, <PERSON> Jessie </PERSON>. Q. But you talked about it to women who are very well aware of the problem. Your staffers here say they move their cars closer to the White House after dark and have someone walk out with them. So women know about the problem. My question is whether you will go and take the message to men's groups and ask their help in eradicating the problem. A. I'm trying to take the message to the whole country. That's what our whole crime package is about _ absolutely, anybody that wants to listen Q. Now, you said also that you wanted to ... A. This is a follow-up, yes.

 A. Well, you have no choice, <PERSON> Tom </PERSON>. If the Chinese say they're not welcome, they ca n't come in. And it's too bad, because one of the things that moved forward the reforms was contact with Americans. And I do n't want to see those contacts cut off. And I'm sorry that the Chinese have made that decision. I would like to have seen those young volunteers go to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and help teach English to the Chinese. And I like these student exchanges, and I do n't want to hurt the <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> people. Now, I have expressed my concern about what went on in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>; I'll reiterate my concern here today. But I reiterate also my desire not to do damage to the people themselves, because I believe that it was contact with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and others in the West that have moved the process of economic reform forward, and hopefully, some day, will move the process of political reform forward. <PERSON> Helen </PERSON>? Q. Mr. <PERSON> President </PERSON>, while you were vice president, millions were syphoned off from <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> through self-confessed influence peddlers, many of which _ who _ were your friends. The homeless grew by the thousands. I have not heard one word of outrage about this from you. You seem to absolve <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>, who sat on this gold mine, permitted this kind of abuse for so many years, and _ not absolve him _ but you do n't criticize him at all. Who was to blame? Where did the buck stop? A. That matter is being looked into by our very able, dedicated secretary of <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> and we are going to do everything we can to clean up any cronyism or see that matters of that nature not recur. But you're always looking for winners and losers, and I am not about to prejudge the secretary himself. I assume that he would accept responsibility for what happened _ past tense _ in his department, just as I would have to assume responsibility for something that goes on in my administration, whether I know about it or not. But let's not be trying to find winners and losers. Let's guarantee the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people that we are not going to have cronyism and special favors and giving contracts because of who you know Let's keep it on the merits. Q. The people were the losers in this. The Republican leaders apparently, their influence peddlers, and so forth, were the winners. Where were you in eight years? A. I was n't handling <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Helen </PERSON>, in eight years ... Q. I know you were n't handling <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION>, but ... A. But if you want to assign _ look, this will give you a little relief. If you want to assign blame of the vice president for what happened over a past of eight years, okay, that's fine. I accept it. But what I want to do as president is see that we do n't have any recurrence and I have total confidence that <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> is working to see that this does not happen again and I hope that the message has gone out loud and clear to every cabinet officer that we want the highest possible ethical standards. Q. Were you aware of any atmosphere? That's all I'm asking. A. No. Q. Mr. <PERSON> President </PERSON>? A. Yeah, Brit? Q. In light of your renewed concern about the display of proper reverence to the flag, I wonder if you think it helps the situation, sir, for you and other political figures of both parties to make the flag the kind of instrument of partisan politics that it was in your campaign last fall, with the visit to Flag City and the tour of flag factories and flags at all the conventions and so on. A. I do n't view that as partisanship. I think respect for the flag transcends political party, and I think what I've said here is American, it is n't Republican or Democrat, it is n't liberal or conservative. And I just feel very, very strongly about it. And perhaps I have n't been quite as emotional as I feel about it, but I want to take this opportunity to say, protest should not extend to desecration of the unique symbol of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, and that is our flag. Follow up. Q. You would n't dispute, would you, sir, that your visit to <LOCATION> Flag </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> <LOCATION> USA </LOCATION> and your visit to the flag factory last year were for the purpose of advancing your political campaign. A. Everything I did last year was for the purpose of advancing my _ everything I did politically _ advancing my election. And of course, I'm not going to say that. But I'm not _ I did n't put it on the basis that Republicans are for the flag and Democrats are not. <PERSON> John </PERSON>? Q. Mr. President, leaving aside the winners and losers question on the <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> scandal, is n't it fair criticism, nevertheless, that the laissez-faire sort of management exhibited by <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> was, as a matter of fact, encouraged by the president himself, and that they really did n't pay attention to what was going on over there?

 A harbor pilot today said he radioed three warnings to the World Prodigy to change course before the tanker ran aground and spilled 420,000 gallons of oil. But the pilot, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON>, told a <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard-National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> hearing he could not be certain the message was received because there was a lot of radio interference at the time. The 533-foot Greek tanker hit a reef at the mouth of <LOCATION> Narragansett </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> on Friday after failing to wait for the pilot to board and guide the vessel into port. <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> authorities are investigating whether the ship was past the point at which a pilot is required by state law. Gov. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> DiPrete </PERSON> testified that hours after the spill, the captain admitted he was at fault. The governor said he asked <PERSON> Iakovos </PERSON> <PERSON> Georgoudis </PERSON>, `` Why were you in that location which requires a pilot to be on board?'' `` He said, ` That was my mistake,''' <PERSON> DiPrete </PERSON> said. `` He made no bones about it.'' <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> said he first talked with the ship about 4:30 p.m. Friday and that the tanker reported it was about 2 -LCB- miles from the point where <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> was supposed to meet it and guide it into the bay. `` My first words were, ` Aim the vessel more toward the -LRB- <PERSON> Brenton </PERSON> <PERSON> Light </PERSON> -RRB- tower,''' <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> testified. `` That was not correct, so I said ` Head the vessel more toward the tower.' Then I said, ` Keep the red buoy on your starboard bow.''' The pilot said he repeated the warning twice but could not be sure it got through. `` That transmission, there was interference with a lot of small-boat traffic,'' <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> said. He said that interference is common during the summer and called on the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> to do something to free up vital radio channels. Most of the spilled oil had dispersed or evaporated by today and no longer posed much of a threat to the shore, officials said. `` It's going to flush out by itself,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petty </ORGANIZATION> Officer <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Gilmore </PERSON>, overseeing the cleanup at <ORGANIZATION> Hull </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cove </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Jamestown </LOCATION>. There had been reports of lobsters killed and several small birds found dead, but officials said those did not appear to be widespread. State Attorney General <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Neil </PERSON> seized the ship's records and has begun criminal investigation. He planned to convene a grand jury on Wednesday.

 Q. Please. You want to be sure that your seven granddaughters have the same opportunities that your pride and joy, <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON>, has. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> is one whom you take on fishing trips, into the back rooms with the boys, and to the research camp at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nebraska </ORGANIZATION> and things like that. I wonder if you're planning to take some of the granddaughters on some of these kinds of excursions where you're doing the business of the nation to prepare them to be president? A. Yeah. When they get older than about 3, I will do that, because now _ I know, now do n't you say it, I'll say it _ <PERSON> Jenna </PERSON> and <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> are about 7, but that's a little young to go fishing in <LOCATION> Jackson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hole </LOCATION> with their grandfather and put up with <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> and all of these people. I mean, I want them prepared for the real world. I'm serious. I want them prepared, and I look forward to the day that those _ they're the _ <PERSON> Noelle </PERSON>, who is just a couple of years behind <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON>, she came up here, we had her with us and she brought her cousin, and we had a wonderful time. And I want her to come back. Indeed, they'll be with us this summer. So _ but no, you raise a good point, and it is n't _ my affection for our oldest grandson is _ it's just that he's there and he's ready. And he plays ball and he does stuff, and we're going to the <ORGANIZATION> Orioles </ORGANIZATION> game tomorrow, I think it is. And so _ but it is not discriminatory, it is not discriminatory. Yeah. Q. Mr. <PERSON> President </PERSON>, if I could ask one last question ... A. Or was n't I not supposed to say that _ What, about the ball game? Come on. Q. Some things that you just ca n't ... Q. If I could ask one last question on the <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> scandal? A. Yeah? Q. I think that many people would think it's unfair to hold you responsible when you were vice president for the things that were going on at <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION>. But some of the people who have been implicated in this scandal are very close to you. I'm thinking of both <PERSON> Frederick </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who was your key fundraiser in the campaign, and <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Manafort </PERSON>, who was an adviser to your campaign and a partner of <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON>, your campaign manager. Have you made any effort to find out exactly what these people who are close to you were doing with <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION>, or to express your views of it to them? Have you made any efforts in those regards? A. I'm not singling out any, you know, _ going, say, look for people that I know that may have done business with <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> in the past. What I am trying to do is do it generically. Say to the degree there was any breaking of the law, obviously the people should pay the, whatever the price is. To the degree we can guard against any abuse for the future, I want to go the extra mile to do that. And one of the first things I did as president, unnoted though it was, was to meet with the inspectors general in here and encourage them towards independence and thorough investigation. And so, that's the way I am trying to handle that matter. Q. As a follow-up, does this affect your relationship with these people, to know that they were involved apparently in influence peddling? A. Well, it does n't improve things, but on the other hand I want to be fair. I want to be sure that I do n't jump at conclusions as to what guilt is and what it is n't, whether law was broken or were people just out there, you know, doing what was permitted. I want to have the standard higher, though, even if it's permitted. I want to have the highest possible standard, but I have n't put it on that kind of a personal basis yet. Q. Mr. <PERSON> President </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> has just passed a child care bill that would spend almost $ 9 billion in federal funds on child care. Your spokesman says that bill is a candidate for a veto. Do you intend to veto that bill, and what are your objections? A. I want to see what comes down here. But if there was one thing that was clear _ I've got to be careful of these gestures, the way these, <PERSON> Rich </PERSON> <PERSON> Little </PERSON> and these guys _ but if there was one thing that was clear, one thing that was clear, it was my position on child care: maximum choice through credits. And the <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> bill does not fit what I think is the proper description for child care. And to then _ for me to take the back seat and say, `` I'm less concerned about child care because I'm unenthusiastic about the <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> bill,'' I do n't accept that at all So I remain convinced that what I have proposed is the right way to go about it. I would like to see what comes down here before I make further statements about what action I will take or wo n't take. I want to know the final, you know, piece of legislation that hits this desk. Q. But you would veto the bill as it stands now. A.I've made my position clear on the <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> bill. Yeah. Q. Sir, you say you do n't want to prejudge Secretary <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>, but does n't the evidence of mismanagement and influence-peddling make it evident to you that there were major problems there at the very top? A. Yes, yes. Q. And what can be done about that? A. Well, that's what the process, that's what the secretary is trying to do right now, is to make guarantees and put out regulations to see that these kinds of abuses _ a woman sitting in <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> ripping off $ 5 million from the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> taxpayers, that's wrong And that _ and I expect that's in the courts. I do n't know, that's where it should be, in my view. Yeah, <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>?

<TEXT>
 Five dissidents have been arrested in <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION>, but it is unclear when or if they will go on trial, an emigre source reported Tuesday. The source confirmed the arrest in <LOCATION> Sofia </LOCATION> last month of the Rev. <PERSON> Hristofor </PERSON> <PERSON> Sabev </PERSON>, an Orthodox priest from <LOCATION> Veliko </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Turnovo </LOCATION> who founded the <ORGANIZATION> Independent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Religious </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Freedom </ORGANIZATION>. It was believed that <PERSON> Sabev </PERSON>, 43, was taken into custody because of his support for religious and human rights in <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION>, including the Turkish minority's ethnic rights. In early June, authorities also arrested <PERSON> Todor </PERSON> <PERSON> Gagalov </PERSON>, an economist and vice president of <ORGANIZATION> Podkrepa </ORGANIZATION>, an independent intellectuals' union, one of about eight dissident groups that have arisen in <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION> recently. Three other leading members of Podkrepa, including <PERSON> Konstantin </PERSON> <PERSON> Trenchev </PERSON>, its president, were arrested last month. Bulgarian government officials said Friday about 50 people were under investigation for their role in ethnic Turkish disturbances last month that Western diplomats say killed 30 people. The clashes with Bulgarian security forces occurred as authorities sought to disperse demonstrators calling for restoration of religious and civil rights of the 1 million-member Turkish minority. More than 70,000 of the ethnic Turks have already left <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION> for <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> after the <LOCATION> Sofia </LOCATION> government opened its borders early this month.

 <PERSON> Kraft </PERSON> today said it is mailing $ 250 checks to hundreds of people who claim they won a $ 17,000 van that was supposed to be the grand prize in a botched contest. Letters accompanying the checks say that the payment `` represents our appreciation for your understanding and good will'' and that the company is `` sorry for any confusion or disappointment the flawed game may have caused.''

 Engineers examined a space shuttle main engine Tuesday to determine if damage it suffered in a test-firing could delay this summer's launch of the shuttle <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION>. `` Engineers have to inspect the engine and look at the data before they can make a decision about <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION>'s launch,'' said <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Drachlis </PERSON>, a space agency spokesman at the <ORGANIZATION> Marshall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Flight </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Huntsville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ala </LOCATION>.

During a shuttle launch, the main engines normally fire for about 8 minutes 30 seconds. There was significant damage to several internal parts, <PERSON> Drachlis </PERSON> said. `` The engine did not blow up; it's still fundamentally intact,'' he said.

<TEXT>
 Energy Secretary <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> today announced a 10-point plan to `` chart a new course'' for what he called the department's failed system of protecting the environment and public health from nuclear weapons production. <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> also said he would press for <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> confirmation of <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Stello </PERSON> as his chief assistant for nuclear weapons even if investigations of <PERSON> Stello </PERSON>'s controversial background reveal `` some chinks in his armor.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> announced the Stello nomination as assistant secretary for defense programs last week. In 1987 a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> panel conducted a hearing on whether Stello, as the staff chief of the <ORGANIZATION> Nuclear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regulatory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, was guilty of improprieties in connection with a commission investigation of the <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Authority </LOCATION>. The probe included the question of whether <PERSON> Stello </PERSON> improperly advised the manager of nuclear power at <ORGANIZATION> TVA </ORGANIZATION> on how to respond to a commission inquiry about the readiness of a plant under construction. Stello denied any improprieties. `` If he has some chinks in his armor ... so be it,'' <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> told a news conference before flying to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> to tour a desert site on which the department is building the nation's first permanment dump for waste generated by the weapons program. He disclosed that the dump, which was scheduled to open in September, would not start receiving any waste until sometime next year. <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> said <PERSON> Stello </PERSON> has the knowledge, experience and commitment to perform the job, which <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> said is one the most important management spots in the department. <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> said the Stello nomination was part of a broader effort to improve <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> management of the nuclear weapons program, which has been crippled in recent years by a series of mechanical failures and questions about safety. The program, conducted through 17 major weapons facilities in 12 states, produces plutonium and other nuclear materials for the weapons, assembles the arms and conducts tests on them. `` I am certainly not proud or pleased with what I have seen over my first few months in office,'' <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> said. `` As a result, I must continue to implement measures that can lead the department to a new culture which takes pride in being good stewards of public lands. ...'' Among the measures announced by <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON>: _ Creation of a set of environmental `` tiger teams'' to conduct independent assessments of whether the weapons plants are complying with federal and state laws _ Changing the terms of department contracts with the private companies that run the weapons plants, to put more emphasis on rewards for safety and environmental compliance _ Accelerating the cleanup of the weapons plants by allocating an additional $ 325 million for the budget year beginning Oct. 1, bringing the total for the year to $ 2.4 billion Also today, a group of 21 environmental, scientific and church groups sued the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> to try to force a broad public review of plans for modernizing the weapons plants. The suit filed in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> said the department should be compelled to prepare a Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement, a comprehensive analysis of the environmental and health effects of its weapons plant initiatives. <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON>, at his news conference, declined to comment directly on the suit except to say he was committed to ensuring full compliance with all environmental requirements. The <ORGANIZATION> Natural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, an environmental group that announced the suit, said the department is required by the National Environmental Policy Act to prepare a public review of its modernization plans. `` It is time DOE came clean with the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> public about its plans for what is really one of the nation's largest and most dangerous industrial operations,'' said <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Reicher </PERSON>, an attorney for the group. Among the groups that joined in the suit are the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Policy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Greenpeace </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Scientists </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Lawyers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nuclear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arms </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, and the Physicians for Social Responsibility.

 <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> has asked the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to delay the start of the <ORGANIZATION> Peace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> program that was to begin sending <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> volunteers to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> this fall to teach English, a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official said today. Authorities also ordered two Americans _ a teacher and a student _ to leave the country, apparently for participating in the student-led pro-democracy movement, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> said. Eleven other Americans, detained Monday in <LOCATION> Kunming </LOCATION> and charged with distributing religious tracts, were released and told to leave <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> by Friday, the embassy said. It said the Americans, members of the <ORGANIZATION> Latter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rain </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Litchfield </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, would leave in the next day or so. In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, group tours to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> involving 43,000 Japanese have been canceled since martial law was declared in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> in May and troops crushed the pro-democracy movement, Japanese officials said. <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> official <PERSON> Tokuji </PERSON> <PERSON> Nakamura </PERSON> said the cancellations cost the agencies $ 60 million in sales. In <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> leaders today called for an embargo on arms sales to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and urged the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> to postpone new loans to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> to protest the government's crackdown. The leaders of the 12-nation <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION>, at their two-day summit, condemned in a statement `` the brutal repression taking place in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>.'' Official Chinese media reported today that the steering committee of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s legislature would meet in special session Thursday to endorse the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s tough stance on dissent. Also to be discussed are a draft law on tightening controls over rallies and demonstrations. Plans to discuss a long-pending bill defining the rights and responsibilities of the press have been shelved. The student demonstrations of April and May _ now called the period of turmoil _ called for greater press freedom, and for several weeks the press enjoyed unprecedented leeway in objectively reporting events. But, since political hard-liners gained the upper hand, the press has reverted to its former role as mouthpiece of the party line. The Chinese gave no reason for their request last week for the <ORGANIZATION> Peace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> postponement, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official said, saying they just wanted to put the program off `` until a more appropriate time.'' The decision was apparently triggered by continuing tension following the June 4 military crackdown in which soldiers killed hundreds of unarmed protesters in clearing central <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> of student protesters. Martial law remains in effect in most of the capital. Twenty Americans had been scheduled to go to <LOCATION> Sichuan </LOCATION> province in central <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> to teach English from this fall, said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official, who would not be further identified. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> has criticized <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> for cutting off military aid because of the bloody crackdown and for harboring leading dissident <PERSON> Fang </PERSON> <PERSON> Lizhi </PERSON> in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Embassy in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. But `` we're not reading anything retaliatory into'' the <ORGANIZATION> Peace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> postponement, the official said. `` It's not by any means canceled.'' The volunteers began a training program in May to prepare for their assignments in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, which would be the 65th nation and first communist country with a Peace Corps program. The two Americans ordered to leave <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> by Friday are a teacher and a student at <ORGANIZATION> Nankai </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in the northeastern port of <LOCATION> Tianjin </LOCATION>, a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> official said on condition of anonymity. Contacted by telephone, a foreign affairs official at the university identified the two as <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Radicia </PERSON>, 25, of <LOCATION> Omaha </LOCATION>, Neb.; and <PERSON> Helen </PERSON> <PERSON> Qubain </PERSON>, 21, of <LOCATION> Buena </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vista </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va </LOCATION>. The official quoted the pair as saying police had ordered them out of the country for violating unspecified regulations on the behavior of foreigners. The official said <PERSON> Radicia </PERSON> taught business management. Six journalists _ three Britons and three Americans _ have been ordered out of the country since June 4 for ther reporting on the situation. The official media said the <ORGANIZATION> Standing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> would hear a report at its session Thursday on `` quelling the counterrevolutionary rebellion.'' The Standing Committee, consisting of about 160 members, meets every few months, usually for about a week, to discuss legislation to be put before the annual full session of the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. Decision-making power in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> rests with the party, and the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>' role has generally been limited to formal approval of laws and government appointments. In recent years, however, it has been given more freedom to delay or revise legislation and to debate national issues.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, reacting to a <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> decision that protects the right of protesters to burn the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> flag, called today for a constitutional amendment that would prohibit desecration of the flag. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said `` support of the First Amendment need not extend'' to desecration of the flag, which he termed `` the unique symbol of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> fielded questions on subjects ranging from international diplomacy to child care legislation to baseball in a free-wheeling 45-minute news conference in the White House briefing room. The president said: _ He will carry a package of economic aid when he travels to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> next month, but wants to first make sure that the communist government there will follow through on economic and political reform. He said Soviet leaders should n't be `` uptight'' about his journey to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>. _ He still favors <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> contacts with <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> despite the continuing crackdown in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> against pro-democracy leaders. _ He has no plans to call for legislation to alter recent <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> rulings on affirmative action that drew criticism from civil rights groups. _ He intends to make sure that any wrongdoing at the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> is thoroughly aired and remedied. _ He criticized legislation passed by the Democratic-controlled <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> on child care, but said he hopes agreement can be worked out on the subject. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> opened his visit to the briefing room by declaring his support for a constitutional amendment that would negate last week's 5-4 <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> decision The court held that burning the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> flag as a form of protest is protected by the Constitution. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said it was important to protect th free-speech guarantees of protest, but he did n't want to extend that to the flag. The court's decision provoked an emotional response in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and elsewhere, and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said protection of the flag will `` in no way limit'' constitutional rights. He said he favored a constitutional amendment over legislation because a law `` can not correct, in my view, the egregious offense of burning the American flag.'' A constitutional amendment must be approved by a two-thirds vote of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, and then ratified by 38 of the 50 states. The day after the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruling, proposed constitutional amendments were introduced in both houses of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. House Speaker <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>, D-Wash., reacted angrily today when reporters suggested that Republicans could make flag burning a partisan issue if Democrats fail to support a constitutional amendment to overturn the ruling `` I'm sure people will play politics with any emotional issue,'' <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> said, calling such partisanship `` reprehensible and disgusting.'' <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> expressed caution about a constitutional amendment. `` I do not feel we should rush into an amendment to the First Amendment of the Constitution,'' he said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also he does not want to see contacts with the Chinese government cut off, despite a continuing crackdown in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> against leaders of a pro-democracy movement. `` I'm going to do my level best to find a way to see improvement there that will help the <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> people,'' he said. He said it was too bad the Chinese have decided against a visit by <ORGANIZATION> Peace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> volunteers this fall. `` I believe that it was contact with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and others in the west that moved the process of economic reforms forward and hopefully someday will move the process of political reform forward.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he does not expect his stops in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> next month to be disruptive to the Communist world, and said he does not expect Soviet leaders to be `` uptight'' abnout his presence in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. He noted that Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> recently went to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, and was very well received there. `` I think it's important that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> show its interest in these countries,'' he said of the two Eastern European nations currently undergoing delicate transitions to greater political rights. He also vowed his administration would get to the bottom of scandals at the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION>. `` We are going to do everything we can to clean up any cronyism and see that matters of that nature do not recur,'' he said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he would not try to assign blame for the problems at <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION>. `` Something might be happening in some department today that I know nothing about. We've got an enormous bureaucracy. We've got a tremendous bureaucracy that extends all around the world and there might be some corruption going,'' he said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he had confidence in <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>, who also has vowed to clean up his department. Investigators are looking into alleged irregularities in housing programs in several states, and congressional committess also are probing the operation of the department under <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>, who served as secretary for eight years under President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also said his advisers have concluded that none of the recent <ORGANIZATION> Sypreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> rulings on affirmative action has jeopardized the principles of equal opportunity for all Americans. The court has made several rulings in recent weeks that civil rights advocates say undercut progress made toward equal rights, and have said they intend to ask <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to write new protections into law. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said if the court's decisions turn out to hamper civil rightrs enforcement, he would consider legislation. But he had no such reluctance on the volatile flag desecration issue, which the court addressed last week. `` I believe the importance of this issue compels me to call for a constitutional amendment. Support for the Constitution need not extend to the desecration of the American flag,'' he said. `` I do feel viscerally about burning the American flag,'' he said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also used his question-and-answer session before White House reporters to renew his opposition to abortion. The Court is expected to issue a ruling later this week on a case involving abortion. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, an avid baseball fan, declined to answer a question on whether <ORGANIZATION> Cincinnati </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reds </ORGANIZATION> manager <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> is being treated fairly by an investigation into his alleged gambling on baseball games.

 <LOCATION> WASHINGTON </LOCATION>: Yeah, <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>? Q. Mr. President. A. Then I've got to go. We've got <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Hawke </PERSON> appearing ... Q. In your message ... A. About whom I spoke highly because of his support for our policies. Yeah? Q. In your message on the rescinding of the pay raise, you said that action was necessary for judges and top federal officials. It's been some time now. I'd like to ask what you're doing about that and when you plan to propose some action. People are still quitting. A. Well, I know it, and I want to see that remedied. I'd like _ I still would like to see the separation of consideration for judges and other key executive branch posts. I'm thinking of some of the researchers in the <ORGANIZATION> NIH </ORGANIZATION> and people of this nature. And I want to see it separated out so it does n't get caught on the question of congressional pay. Now, whether the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> is willing to do what I've suggested, I do n't know. But I will have suggestions when we make our announcements, I think Thursday, on _ further announcements along this line _ as to what I think needs to be done. And I am not trying to dictate to the legislative branch, but I am going to have to make some recommendations, and maybe I can do that as a former member of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> who is concerned about what the legislative branch ought to do. This is a matter of considerable concern. This is the last, and then one behind you. And then I've got to go because <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Hawke </PERSON> is appearing. Q. A follow up, Mr. President. A. Next time, <PERSON> Sarah </PERSON>. I'm sorry. I got half, I got two-thirds back there. Yes? Q. Your suggestions will be specific pay raise proposals, and will they take the form of a proposed legislative bill? A. Excuse me? Q. Will your suggestions, when you mention them on Thursday, be specific as to salary increases? A. Yes. Q. And will they take the form of a bill? A. No _ well, yes. I think we will have specifics on the _ I have n't, you know, gone over this with the final recommendations internally, although I'm reading now what I've decided and _ very clear. But there will be some specific recommendations with amounts. Yes, now I do _ <PERSON> Johanna </PERSON>, yes? Q. Mr. President, a lot of Americans this summer are talking about <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> and I wondered, without prejudging his case, what you think about betting on baseball and whether you think that that should be reviewed by the courts or the commissioner of baseball? A. I am not going to get into how that matter should be resolved. Baseball, the national pastime, has sound rules regarding betting on baseball games and I simply am going to _ I do n't _ I'm not going to get into that one. Yeah, last _ this is the last. Mr. <PERSON> Matthews </PERSON>, then I'm going. Q. Mr. <PERSON> President </PERSON>, are you concerned that a deterioration in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> relations with <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> would disrupt the strategic balance between the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>? And is that of overriding importance in your reaction to events there? A. It is a matter of _ that as you look at the whole <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> area, you have to consider that. I have never been one who thinks that the relationship with <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> ought to be based on playing the Soviet card or quote, `` playing the <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> card,'' unquote. But _ and it is not _ I will not overlook fundamental abuses of human rights because of a strategic concern. But, of course when you look at your _ all of your relationships, a president must be concerned about the strategic importance of the relationship. And not only is our relationship with <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> of strategic importance. It has this whole cultural and educational and art and, hopefully, some human rights side of it. So you look at it in what is right between <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. But, of course, I'm concerned about the strategic implications. And it's not just the strategic implications vis-a-vis the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> Take a look at what <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaoping </PERSON> used to call `` encirclement.'' And look at what he means. Just take a look at <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> on the map and you'll understand why the Chinese leaders still, as recently as three months ago, talked about encirclement. And that gets you into the questions of the <ORGANIZATION> ASEAN </ORGANIZATION> countries; it gets you into the question of what's happening in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> today; it gets you into question of, obviously, then <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peninsula </LOCATION>, and there's a lot of strategic interest involved here. Q. Sir, if you're terribly sorry, why do n't you do something about it Why do n't you let me have a question a minute? A. The questions take too _ a real short one, and I'll go for it. Q. All right, all right. When you went out to see <PERSON> Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Pepper </PERSON>, and he was dying, he rose up and said, `` Mr. <PERSON> President </PERSON>, when are we going to get home health care?'' And you looked at him and you wanted to cooperate with him, and I'm sure you're anxious to do something about that. Will you tell us if you're going to do something about it? A. Regrettably, we ca n't go the route that the late <PERSON> Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Pepper </PERSON> wanted. But I hope we can have more emphasis on care at home. And I think that would be a very good way to approach the health care needs of this country. But we ca n't go totally with what <PERSON> Claude </PERSON> was suggesting. Q. You did n't explain to me what the constitutional groups have legislated on flag burning A. Because I am told that legislation can not correct the, in my view, egregious offense of burning <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> flags. Q. How about the death penalty for teen-agers and the retarded? A. I really do have to leave.

<HEAD>The Universal Appeal of a Danish Prince</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MATT WOLF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 When it comes to <PERSON> Shakespeare </PERSON>, `` Hamlet'' is still very much the thing. In recent months, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s two large government-subsidized theaters have tackled the Prince of <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION>, and two other <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> plays are now on using <PERSON> Hamlet </PERSON> as a central character. It remains one of the world's favorite plays, and <PERSON> Hamlet </PERSON>'s celebrated soliloquy has become universal, whether in Chinese -LRB- `` si hai shi huo'' -RRB-, Swedish -LRB- `` Att vara eller icke vara'' -RRB- or English -LRB- `` To be or not to be'' -RRB- In <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Patrice </PERSON> <PERSON> Chereau </PERSON>'s production recently swept the Moliere Awards, the <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> equivalent of Broadway's <PERSON> Tony </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> has averaged eight major `` Hamlet'' productions every year for the past three years. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s Public Theater presented it in 1986 with <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Kline </PERSON> as the prince. Women have played him, too, notably the great French actress <PERSON> Sarah </PERSON> <PERSON> Bernhardt </PERSON> a century ago, <PERSON> Dame </PERSON> <PERSON> Judith </PERSON> <PERSON> Andersonand </PERSON> more recently <PERSON> Diane </PERSON> <PERSON> Venora </PERSON> at the Public in 1982. <PERSON> Laurence </PERSON> <PERSON> Olivier </PERSON> called it `` the best play ever written,'' and his 1948 film portrayal was the only <PERSON> Shakespeare </PERSON> work ever to win Academy Awards for best film and best actor. Others have tried to shape it to the times. The great 18th-century actor <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Garrick </PERSON> hated the graveyard scene. `` I swore,'' he said, `` that I would not leave the stage'till I had rescued that noble play from all the rubbish of the fifth act.'' The Victorians left out <PERSON> Hamlet </PERSON>'s lapses into vernacular, along with anything else that might portray him as less than a perfect prince. Nowadays, producers are more apt to drop the subplot involving the agents and friends of <PERSON> Hamlet </PERSON>'s <PERSON> Rosencrantz </PERSON> and Guildenstern, a trend which in itself inspired a whole, much-applauded play by British dramatist <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Stoppard </PERSON> about two characters who find they do not exist outside the play. In 1987, Swedish director <PERSON> Ingmar </PERSON> <PERSON> Bergman </PERSON>'s acclaimed production with his <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dramatic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Theater </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stockholm </ORGANIZATION> had a week-long run in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, and in September Russian director <PERSON> Yuri </PERSON> <PERSON> Lyubimov </PERSON> will stage `` Hamlet'' with a British company at the <ORGANIZATION> Leicester </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Haymarket </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Theater </ORGANIZATION>. Drawn from Scandinavian legend, `` Hamlet'' is about a prince who comes home from university to discover that his father has been murdered by his brother who has usurped the throne and married the queen he has widowed. Setting out to clean up the rot in the kingdom of <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Hamlet </PERSON> plunges into a jungle of intrigue, thwarted passion and switched poisons. He emerges triumphant, only to complete the tragedy by dying in a sword fight. At its most basic, <PERSON> Hamlet </PERSON> is a rattling good revenge yarn. But it is also that rare play whose significance can continually be reshaped to meet a society's preconceptions. Thus, audiences over the ages have seen <PERSON> Hamlet </PERSON> as Marxist, capitalist, pacifist, militarist, aristocrat, populist, Freudian obsessive and man of action. This troubles some actors including <PERSON> Jonathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Pryce </PERSON>, who derides what he calls the `` Hamlet industry.'' They wonder whether the play's appeal is also its weakness: whether by applying to everything and everyone, `` Hamlet'' risks being about nothing in particular. `` Is Hamlet really such a difficult part to get right?'' asks <PERSON> Lynne </PERSON> <PERSON> Truss </PERSON> in The Listener magazine. `` The answer seems to be that, on the contrary, it is awfully hard to get it wrong, since any interpretation seems to be valid.'' In recent years Londoners have been treated to <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Rees </PERSON>' dry, intensely cerebral <PERSON> Hamlet </PERSON> at the <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shakespeare </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Company </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Stormare </PERSON>'s manic, military <PERSON> Hamlet </PERSON> for <PERSON> Ingmar </PERSON> <PERSON> Bergman </PERSON>; and now <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Day-Lewis </PERSON>' highly emotional and impetuous <PERSON> Hamlet </PERSON> at the National. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Eyre </PERSON>'s production continues the National's tradition of doing a `` Hamlet'' near the start of each artistic director's tenure <PERSON> Day-Lewis </PERSON>, best known for the films `` The Unbearable Lightness of Being,'' `` My Beautiful Laundrette'' and `` A Room With a View,'' has inherited a part played in 1963 by <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Toole </PERSON> and in 1976 by <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Finney </PERSON>. Also on show are <PERSON> Iris </PERSON> <PERSON> Murdoch </PERSON>'s `` The Black Prince,'' adapted from her 1973 novel, and the revival of <PERSON> Anton </PERSON> <PERSON> Chekhov </PERSON>'s 1887 `` <PERSON> Ivanov </PERSON>,'' with <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Bates </PERSON> as a penniless landowner who sees himself as a failed Hamlet figure. <PERSON> Murdoch </PERSON>, 69, first encountered <PERSON> Hamlet </PERSON> as a school text when she was 15. She `` an insane passion'' for the work, similar to that of <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> <PERSON> Pearson </PERSON>, the sardonic tax inspector of `` The Black Prince'' who comes alive when thinking or speaking of <PERSON> Hamlet </PERSON>. `` I became absolutely entranced by it and by <PERSON> Shakespeare </PERSON> generally,'' she recalled in an interview. `` He's very good on politics and power ... a great source of inspiration to novelists.'' From <PERSON> Garrick </PERSON> and <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Irving </PERSON> through <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Barrymore </PERSON>, <PERSON> Olivier </PERSON> and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Gielgud </PERSON> to today's acting generation, <PERSON> Hamlet </PERSON> remains the hurdle every classical actor must overcome to attain true celebrity. And they rarely agree on whether <PERSON> Hamlet </PERSON> is an easy role or a difficult one. `` It's quite easy, because it's such an accommodating part which adapts itself to the personality of the actor,'' argues <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Pennington </PERSON>, who played the role in 1980 at <LOCATION> Stratford </LOCATION>. But <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Rylance </PERSON>, who plays `` Hamlet'' in the <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shakespeare </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Company </ORGANIZATION>'s current <LOCATION> Stratford </LOCATION> production, disagrees. `` I find it utterly enigmatic; as soon as one locates the role, it changes,'' the 29-year-old actor said in an interview. `` The challenge is to bring your own jumble of brain cells to the feminine and masculine qualities which are in conflict in the part. ... A lot of people cop out of that.'' <PERSON> Eyre </PERSON>, 46, first directed `` Hamlet'' in an acclaimed <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> production in 1980, then returned to the play intrigued by its elasticity. `` I came more and more to see the play as an archetype of growing up, the model for a whole genre of storytelling which has taken over the novel and films, too,'' he said. `` It's about a man trying to accommodate, to come to terms with, a completely alien political and social world. When he starts off, <PERSON> Hamlet </PERSON> is Everyman, but for the fact that he's a prince. `` This panders to our various fantasy aspirations while at the same time it concurs with our sense of not wanting to grow up, not wanting to be absorbed by an essentially alien world of Realpolitik.''

<HEAD>Grain Export Dispute Center of Talks</HEAD>

The Australians say</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> today welcomed Australian Prime Minister <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Hawke </PERSON> for talks focusing on the <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> crisis as well as a thorny dispute between their countries over grain exports. The grain dispute, in which <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> claims that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> subsidies to domestic growers are harmful to its markets, has settled into a holding pattern. Both sides agree it should be decided at the current round of trade liberalization talks now under way in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>, said Acting Assistant Secretary of State <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON>. <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> told reporters after the president and <PERSON> Hawke </PERSON> met that the two nations are in agreement that grain subsidies should be done away with, but the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration is unwilling to take such steps until an agreement involving other countries is reached at the international forum. In an arrival ceremony on the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>'s South Lawn, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said Australians and Americans share a `` pioneer heritage in the taming of two vast continents, a heritage of democratic ideas and a heritage of common sacrifice in war and common efforts in peace.'' The two leaders discussed among other issues the current repression in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, which the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> both have condemned. <PERSON> Hawke </PERSON> later gave the president a strong vote of confidence during a photo session in the Oval Office, saying that his views are `` identical'' to those of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in deploring and condemning `` the barbarism'' of <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> in violently suppressing the demonstrations for democracy. However, he said, <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> shares the administration's concern that it not take actions that would reverse <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s economic reforms. While <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> did not publicly mention the agriculture dispute, <PERSON> Hawke </PERSON> was outspoken in stating that he would bring up the matter. <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> dislikes the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>' Export Enhancement Program, which provides subsidies to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> grain growers. <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> contends its subsidy program is operated `` in a manner that does n't harm traditional suppliers.'' The Australians say the subsidy program has cut into their exports to other markets and gives the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> growers an unfair price advantage. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> maintains the program is aimed at countering only <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s protectionist policies. The subject was a matter of some controversy during Vice President <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s recent visit to <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>. During the arrival ceremonies, <PERSON> Hawke </PERSON> addressed the matter saying, `` Mr. President, it is precisely because of the depth and the maturity of our relationship that the difference of views that do exist between us can be faced openly and honestly, for example, on some trade matters particularly aspects of agricultural policy.'' `` I am quite confident that today we will be able to focus on ways to minimize, if not entirely resolve such differences.'' <PERSON> Hawke </PERSON> said in a speech Monday in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> that although damage to <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> from the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy `` has lessened over the past year or so, owing to lower world grain harvests and a running down of stocks, there remains a danger that competitive expoert subsidisation will agian damage <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> when grain surpluses re-emerge.'' In addition, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said the two leaders would discuss shares strategic interests and <PERSON> Hawke </PERSON>'s strong support for banning chemical weapons, a position <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> strongly advocated during his presidential campaign. `` You may be assured of our commitment to the early achievement of an effectively verifiable treaty banning these weapons,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. He also hailed <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>'s `` bold leadership in foreign policy, both close to home and far from your shores. From the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> is a force for economic growth and a beacon of democracy,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said.

 In Act III, scene 1 of <PERSON> Shakespeare </PERSON>'s `` Hamlet,'' the tormented prince contemplates life and death. Brooding over his uncle's usurpation of the throne and hasty marriage with his widowed mother, he ponders whether or not he should kill the usurper _ or himself. <PERSON> Hamlet </PERSON> reveals his thoughts to the audience, but not to the other characters, in what is regarded as one of the most important passages in drama. Just about every school child has at one point or another memorized <PERSON> Hamlet </PERSON>'s soliloquy, and actors throughout the world explore its meaning in almost every language, including Chinese -LRB- `` si hai shi huo'' -RRB- and Swedish -LRB- `` Att vara eller icke vara'' -RRB-.

 A nuclear blast up to 12 times more powerful than the bomb dropped on <LOCATION> Hiroshima </LOCATION> rocked the desert this morning in the second major <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> weapons test in a week. The blast registered 4.6 on the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Earthquake </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Golden </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colo. </LOCATION>, said spokesman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Minsch </PERSON>. The test, code-named <LOCATION> Amarillo </LOCATION>, was deemed a success by the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. Spokesman <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Boyer </PERSON> said monitors indicated no leak of radiation. The device was detonated 2,100 feet beneath the test range at 8:30 a.m. and had an explosive force of up to 150,000 tons of TNT. The blast that destroyed <LOCATION> Hiroshima </LOCATION> had an explosive force of 13,000 tons of TNT. Ground zero was three miles from where a test code-named Contact was conducted June 22. That blast measured 5.2 on the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale. The test was scheduled for Saturday but was repeatedly delayed by unfavorable wind. Tests are not conducted if winds are blowing toward a populated area such as <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION> in case radiiation escapes the underground cavity. Both devices were classified as having a range of between 20 and 150 kilotons, the upper limit allowed under treaties with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. Today's test was believed to be near the upper limit. When a test is conducted near the upper limits, the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> announces the blast in advance and warns managers of highrise buildings in <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION> not to have workers in precarious positions.

<HEAD>Watermelon Production Making Comeback _ Maybe</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> analysts say watermelons may be making a comeback but have no first-hand figures to back it up. That's because nobody at <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> has counted watermelons since 1981, although the annual production of honeydew melons is reported faithfully, including the number of acres planted and harvested, along with the crop's yearly value. Watermelon output is probably four, five or six times that of honeydew production, which is concentrated in <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. Commercial watermelon farmers are reported in more than two dozen states. `` I do n't know why they are n't reported,'' says <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Lucier </PERSON> of the department's <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. `` I asked that question, too.'' In a telephone interview on Monday, <PERSON> Lucier </PERSON> said production information from the industry apparently will be relied upon heavily as <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> develops a new marketing program financed by watermelon growers and handlers. <PERSON> Lucier </PERSON> and <PERSON> Amy </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Allred </PERSON>, another economist, analyzed the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> watermelon situation in a new report issued by the agency. `` Through 1980, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> production was trending downward and domestic utilization was in a tailspin,'' the report said. `` Domestic watermelon production gradually fell from 29.3 million hundredweight in 1960 to 26.1 million in 1981, the last year <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> officially estimated production.'' Although national figures from the department are lacking, some states continue to report production. These show that production in those states have increased one-fourth since 1981, including gains in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>. `` Favorable grower prices have contributed to the gains,'' the report said. `` In addition, available state production data show that per capita -LRB- use -RRB- has increased one-fifth since the 1980 low.'' Part of the per capita increase is due to an overall trend to more fresh produce in diets, more watermelon imports and the convenience of relatively new `` icebox'' and seedless melons _ plus better produce marketing in retail stores. A major step was taken in February when commercial watermelon growers and handlers voted in favor of a national promotion program authorized by the 1985 farm law. The <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> is in the process of writing final regulations and clearing the way for naming a 29-member <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Watermelon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Promotion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>. The board's program will be financed, beginning in 1990, by an assessment on watermelons sold for human consumption. The levy can be set at a rate of up to two cents per 100 pounds, paid by first handlers and producers who grow five or more acres of melons. A grower who also is a handler would pay assessments for each function. The fees are refundable upon request, but the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Watermelon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> hopes the plan will raise $ 1 million annually. The association last week held its annual Watermelon Feast Day on Capitol Hill and in the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> itself, including the appearance of this year's national watermelon queen, <PERSON> Jennifer </PERSON> <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pines </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C </LOCATION>. According to the association, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> watermelon industry _ with a farm value of $ 160 million _ `` produces two billion or more pounds of watermelon in nearly 30 states,'' led by <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> and followed by <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION>.

 An <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> report shows vegetable processors have contracted for a sharply larger acreage this year to help make up for 1988 drought-shriveled production. Overall, growers will have 1.41 million acres devoted to four major vegetable crops in 1989, a 14 percent increase from last year and 15 percent more than in 1987. `` Planted acreage of snap beans is up 22 percent; sweet corn is up 8 percent; green peas jumped 15 percent; while tomatoes increased 17 percent,'' the report said Monday. Vegetables contracted for canning totaled 970,000 acres, including tomatoes, a 13 percent increase. Freezers contracted 441,000 acres, up 17 percent. Reduced production last year because of drought helped boost vegetable prices sharply, including further rises in the first quarter of 1989, according to department economists. Consumer food prices generally this year are expected to rise an average of 4 percent to 7 percent, compared with a rise in 1988 of 4.1 percent. The retail price of processed vegetables by themselves rose an average of 4.8 percent in 1988, compared with a 2.8 percent increase in 1987. This year, according to <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> economists, consumer prices of processed vegetables are expected to be 8 percent to 10 percent higher.

He said his home state of <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION> last year had a net farm income of `` something over $ 2 billion,'' of which more than $ 1 billion came from the government. `` That's pretty addictive,'' he said.

<TEXT>
 The Soviet Union used an East-West human rights conference last week to sell itself as host for a follow-up session in 1991. Laboring under <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and British threats to boycott the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> conference if sufficient progress in human rights is not made, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> delegation tried to dispel doubts about its sincerity. The month-long Conference on the Human Dimension, which ended Friday, was the first of three on human rights held in the framework of the 1975 <LOCATION> Helsinki </LOCATION> accords. Ambassador <PERSON> Yuri </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kashlev </PERSON> said his delegation held more than 100 meetings with journalists and human rights groups, assuring a high profile and an `` open and straightforward position'' that `` drew positive response.'' Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> set the tone in a speech May 30 at the 35-nation forum, saying the affirmation of individual rights should be the objective of all countries. A Soviet official later paid his nation's first clear homage to <PERSON> Raoul </PERSON> <PERSON> Wallenberg </PERSON>, the Swedish diplomat who saved thousands of Jews in <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> in World War II, then disappeared after being arrested by occupying Soviet forces. `` We profoundly regret the death of this noble person,'' said <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> Andreyev </PERSON> of the Soviet prosecutor's office. <PERSON> Wallenberg </PERSON>'s fate, he said, `` is a somber page in our history. Over the following month, the affable Soviet delegation laid on news conferences and opened its doors to special interest groups with grievances about human rights abuses in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. The Soviets deny they fear a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> boycott of the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> meeting and say their attitude reflects the fruits of President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s policies of social and economic reforms. `` It's not an artificial thing,'' said <PERSON> Kashlev </PERSON>. `` Even before the decision on the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> conference, we were the same open people ... It's not just a trick to persuade somebody.'' The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> agreed to attend the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> conference `` in the expectation that progress in human rights would continue'' and that free access by protest groups be guaranteed, said a ranking member of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> delegation, who asked not to be identified. `` We have agreed ... and we're planning to go,'' he said. `` But we would have a very hard time sending a delegation if things moved backward.'' `` The decision has been taken,'' said the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> ambassador. `` There is no force in the world that will stop it -LRB- the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> conference -RRB- from being held.'' With or without the Americans, `` the process of democratization will continue,'' <PERSON> Kashlev </PERSON> said. `` It's not because of their pressure. It's our own internal development. It's <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> who does this, not Mr. <PERSON> Abram </PERSON>,'' he said of <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Abram </PERSON>, head of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> delegation in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>. The stakes for <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> are high. Holding the third conference there amounts to an affirmation of Soviet compliance with the principles of the <LOCATION> Helsinki </LOCATION> Final Act subscribed to by the nations of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. The conference includes all European nations except <LOCATION> Albania </LOCATION>, as well as the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>. The three human rights conferences were decided on at the close of a January meeting in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>. The second conference will be held next year in <LOCATION> Copenhagen </LOCATION>, and a final meeting is scheduled for <LOCATION> Helsinki </LOCATION> in 1992. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and West European nations have acknowledged broad Soviet progress in human rights under <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. While East bloc allies <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION> were criticized for human rights abuses, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> was praised for progress and a new spirit of cooperation. `` The Soviets have taken some comfort that they are not the worst,'' said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> delegate. They have used a `` non-confrontational, more tolerant approach than we've seen before,'' he said. `` For quite a long time, our position was ` hands off _ it's our internal affair,''' <PERSON> Kashlev </PERSON> said. `` We have changed completely, much more than the West.''

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A judge has ordered local, state and federal agencies to expand efforts to open suburban <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> housing to black families. Ruling in a lawsuit filed 11 years ago, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> ordered the state to give the <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fair </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> authority to issue subpoenas, levy fines and start civil actions to attack discrimination. <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> agreed with the charge in the lawsuit by the <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> NAACP </ORGANIZATION> that the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> failed to use its grant programs to produce an adequate supply of affordable integrated family housing in the metropolitan area. <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON>'s findings dealt with <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> practices between 1977 to 1982. But he wrote, `` The conditions, exacerbated by <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION>'s pattern of inaction, apparently continue to exist and are currently remediable.'' The ruling, made public Monday, is a `` blockbuster _ a whole new world,'' said <PERSON> Dianne </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilkerson </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> chapter of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> for the Advancement of Colored People. `` This ruling changes life for minorities in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> in some very major ways. This is just amazing.'' <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Jacqueline </PERSON> <PERSON> Roundtree </PERSON> said the department had not decided whether to appeal. The ruling orders <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> and the state to require owners of all government-assisted housing in metropolitan <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> to participate fully in anti-discrimination programs. It also orders <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> to create a clearinghouse with a list of federally assisted housing units. In 1985, <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> dismissed the lawsuit, saying he lacked authority to review and correct <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> practices. In 1987, an appeals court said <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> did have authority and ordered him to reopen the case.

 Mormons today dedicated a $ 1 million shrine in the old jail where a mob 145 years ago killed church founder <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> and his brother. <ORGANIZATION> Mormon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Ezra </PERSON> <PERSON> Taft </PERSON> <PERSON> Benson </PERSON>, Gov. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> and more than 3,000 others attended ceremonies marking the end of a restoration project at the site considered sacred by the world's 6.5 million Mormons. <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> Hinckley </PERSON>, first counselor to <PERSON> Benson </PERSON>, recalled the shooting of <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> and his brother, <PERSON> Hyrum </PERSON>, on June 27, 1844 as part of an `` epic story of martyrdom.'' `` Few could foresee the future stature of the man whose blood stained the floor of this jail,'' <PERSON> Hinckley </PERSON> said. `` We are grateful for the reconciliation that has come with the passage of time.'' The jail has been restored to its 1844 appearance. A statue of the Smiths and six slate monuments inscribed with quotations from <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> also were unveiled. The former jail's renovation was completed to coincide with the 150th anniversary of the Mormons' settlement in the <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> town of <LOCATION> Nauvoo </LOCATION>, 200 miles north of <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>. The Church of <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> <PERSON> Christ </PERSON> of Latter-day <ORGANIZATION> Saints </ORGANIZATION> envisioned the town as its home. But non-believers persecuted the Mormons over <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>'s claims that he had spoken with God. `` <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hyrum </PERSON> were summoned to <LOCATION> Carthage </LOCATION> to stand trial and were being held at the jail when they were murdered by the mob. It is a sacred place to us,'' said <PERSON> Loren </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dunn </PERSON>, president of the restoration project.

 An American free-lance photographer said Tuesday he was chained and handcuffed after his arrest by Afghan security forces 19 days ago. <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Brien </PERSON>, accompanied by police and agents of the Afghan secret police, told a news conference that authorities have treated him well since then. His comments came as a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official arrived from <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> to negotiate his release. <PERSON> O'Brien </PERSON>, 43, of <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fe </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.M. </LOCATION>, said Afghan officials told him he would be tried for entering the country without a valid travel document. The charge carries a prison term of five to 10 years. Looking relaxed and smiling at the <ORGANIZATION> Kabul </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> O'Brien </PERSON> apologized to the government for entering <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> without a visa. `` I really want to thank the Afghan government,'' he said at the news conference, which was videotaped by Afghan television. `` I know I have broken the laws of the country ... I apologize for that.'' <PERSON> O'Brien </PERSON> said he was not pressured to make statements. `` I was told that journalists wanted to meet me,'' he said. `` I was asked if I was willing.'' <PERSON> O'Brien </PERSON> said he was handcuffed and chained when arrested June 8 in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>, but since then, `` They have really treated me well, I did not expect this.'' <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Nabi </PERSON> <PERSON> Amani </PERSON> said <PERSON> O'Brien </PERSON> had entered <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> six times in the company of the U.S.-backed Moslem guerrillas fighting the pro-Soviet <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> government. <PERSON> O'Brien </PERSON> nodded. Journalists enter <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> with the Pakistan-based guerrillas because the government in the past had refused visas to many Western journalists. But the government opened up its doors in June 1988, and 1,200 foreign journalists have entered the country with valid visas since then. At least three Western journalists and two foreign aid workers have been captured while traveling with guerrillas during the decade-long civil war.

It appears almost certain he will spend his 54th birthday, July 25, in a <LOCATION> Bern </LOCATION> jail.

<TEXT>
 National Party chief F.W. <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON> said Tuesday that European leaders he met on a recent tour understand <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> must go through a gradual process of reform. <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON>, designated the next president of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, indicated that international pressure and economic sanctions on his country may ease `` as long as it is visible that we're really working towards a negotiation situation.'' At the airport news conference, <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON> did not say how he planned to engage leaders of the disenfranchised black majority in negotiations to end the apartheid system of race discrimination. He said he gave `` no concrete agenda'' to leaders he met in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION>. `` Neither I, nor those whom I had discussions with, attempted to make unrealistic demands or create unrealistic expectations,'' <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON> said. His overall impression from the tour `` is that there is realization that what happens here must be step-by-step and that there is realization that to really have successful renewal and change in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> which will not affect the stability of this country the first step is to broaden and intensify the base of discussions as a phase even before what one could call a real negotiation phase.'' Opponents say <LOCATION> Pretoria </LOCATION> uses minor reforms to shield itself against criticism and delay the advent of black rule in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. At nearly every stop on his European tour, <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON> was asked about the release of <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>, leader of the outlawed <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, who has been imprisoned since 1962 under a life sentence for sabotage and plotting to overthrow the government. Asked about <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> on Tuesday, <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON> referred to the Sept. 6 parliamentary elections, after which he is expected to succeed President P.W. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>. `` I want to win the election for my party and I would n't like to make particular statements as to what I, in whatever position one might be, will particularly do afterward,'' <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON> said, indicating <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>'s release would lose him votes among right-wing whites. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> suffered a stroke this year and has said he will retire after the elections. Also on Tuesday, West German Labor Minister <PERSON> Norbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Bluem </PERSON> said he had a tough encounter with <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>, with the president refusing to discuss condemned prisoners or allow him to visit <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>. Instead, <PERSON> Bluem </PERSON> said, <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> briefed him on economic progress in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bluem </PERSON> said he replied that human rights are not determined by `` improved living standards alone. A man does not live on bread alone.'' <PERSON> Bluem </PERSON> said <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> answered that `` he -LRB- <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> -RRB- will decide which position is the right one.'' When <PERSON> Bluem </PERSON> asked to see <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>, <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> referred him to the minister of justice, who was not on the West German's itinerary.

 The head of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Churches </ORGANIZATION> announced his resignation today in a dispute over the future of the country's biggest ecumenical organization. The Rev. <PERSON> Arie </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brouwer </PERSON>, general secretary of the council since 1985, said the organization is not ready to pursue the unifying goals he set for it. `` The time is not ripe for it,'' he said in announcing he will step down on Friday. The council, which includes most major <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> and Eastern Orthodox churches in the country, has been enmeshed in controversy for three years over departmental accountability and authority, as well as financial difficulties. <PERSON> Brouwer </PERSON>, who came close to being dismissed a month ago, had pressed for closer integration of various council units against stiff resistance by some officials. Their `` dream was different than mine,'' he said. <PERSON> Brouwer </PERSON>, 53, a <ORGANIZATION> Reformed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> clergyman, said the rupture was clarified for him by a 57-57 vote over a move to dismiss him at the council's governing board meeting in <LOCATION> Lexington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>, last month. Since the vote, pressure for <PERSON> Brouwer </PERSON> to step down continued. `` I will be in prayer and fasting over the days and weeks to come,'' <PERSON> Brouwer </PERSON> had said after the vote. <PERSON> Brouwer </PERSON> riled some board members with a scathing report in <LOCATION> Lexington </LOCATION>, saying recent months had been `` a crucifixion, a journey through hell.'' He said the ecumenical atmosphere has been fouled with `` rumors, innuendo and false charges ... poured forth from the bureaucratic rumor mill,'' public media and religious press. Defending his own leadership style, he said: `` The problem is that I have dared to speak the truth to the will to power. ... The powerful are not accustomed to such behavior and they are outraged. They will not have it.'' The main conflict had come over moves to make the council a more united body functioning as a `` communion of communions,'' with each department sharing proportionately in central administrative costs. That system was strongly resisted by <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, the council's relief arm and financially biggest operation. The service had operated somewhat independently and with its own revenues. A furor developed in mid-1988 when the service's executive, the Rev. <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Butler </PERSON>, resigned because of conflict with <PERSON> Brouwer </PERSON> over integrating the service more closely with other council units. As a result of the internal stress, general recommedations of a reorganizational committee were approved at the <LOCATION> Lexington </LOCATION> meeting, consolidating the council's 11 units into four. Measures that would give member denominations more direct oversight of the council units were part of the plan, specifics of which were to be worked out in September.

 Attorney General <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> told a black audience today that the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration wo n't pursue legislation to overturn recent <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> decisions on civil rights. However, <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> said he would monitor implementation of the rulings and take `` any legislative or executive action that might be required to resolve inequities.'' `` The pursuit and promotion of civil rights in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> is more than a legal obligation, it is a moral imperative embodied in our national sense of fairness and justice,'' <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> told the annual convention of Operation PUSH, the civil rights group founded by the Rev. <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. The high court, adopting some positions advocated by the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> under the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration, has restricted affirmative action programs and made it more difficult for plaintiffs to prove discrimination in the workplace. The decisions have prompted calls from some lawmakers to consider legislation to overturn the rulings. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told a news conference today his advisers concluded that none of the rulings has jeopardized the principles of equal opportunity for all Americans. He said if the court's decisions turn out to hamper civil rightrs enforcement, he would consider legislation <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON>, in his first public pronouncement on the controversial cases, said some viewed the decisions `` as a retreat in the battle for civil rights.'' But, <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> asked, do `` these decisions ... stand in conflict with this nation's fundamental commitment to ensure the provision of civil rights of all Americans? Or do these decisions represent attempts by the court to fine-tune the complexities of enforcement of civil rights law in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>?'' <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> said the effect of the rulings would not be felt until they are applied in new cases, but that President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had asked him to monitor their implementation. `` This responsibility is one I take very seriously and one that the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> will approach consistent with our commitment to the goals of fairness and equality in our quest for equal opportunity,'' <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> said. During a discussion following the speech, several panelists expressed disappointment that <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> did n't favor immediate legislation to overturn the high court rulings. `` In the past six days, the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> has basically repealed Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964,'' said <PERSON> Julius </PERSON> <PERSON> Chambers </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> NAACP </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Legal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Educational </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` It disappoints us, to put it mildly, to suggest that we must now wait to see how these decisions work in practice.'' `` We ask the administration to express the same reverence for equal opportunity'' as for the American flag, said employment rights lawyer <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Creiter </PERSON>, referring to President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s proposal for a constitutional amendment to overturn the high court's legalization of flag burning. <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Neas </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> Leadership </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION>, an umbrella group of civil rights organizations nationwide, had said the administration's response would be an important test. `` President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has repeatedly stated his commitment to civil rights and to minority outreach efforts. However, a decision to oppose legislation to overturn the recent <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> decisions would be completely incompatible with such a commitment,'' <PERSON> Neas </PERSON> said before <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON>'s speech. `` Indeed, remedial legislation has become the No. 1 priority for everyone committed to equal employment opportunity for all Americans,'' <PERSON> Neas </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> spoke at the invitation of <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, who hailed the attorney general's commitment to civil rights after the two met at the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Departent </ORGANIZATION> last winter. `` The lights have been turned back on in the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and hopefully the dust will be cleared from the books,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> told reporters that day. He was referring to the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration's civil rights record, which was roundly criticized by black leaders. As he did after the meeting with <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> has repeatedly expressed commitment to `` the full enforcement of civl rights laws ... and the full enjoyment of equal opportunity by all of its citizens.'' But the attorney general has conceded he may have differences with civil rights leaders about achieving those goals. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON>, whose nomination to head the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s civil rights division has split the civil rights lobby, was accompanying <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> to the convention A black Republican from <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON>' nomination is opposed by several organizations who contend he lacks the necessary legal experience to be the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s civil rights chief. But <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and other black leaders have expressed support, albeit muted in some cases, for the <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON> nomination.

 The Romanian <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s policy-making <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> convened Tuesday in <LOCATION> Bucharest </LOCATION> to discuss the upcoming 14th Party Congress in November, the official Agerpres news agency said The two-day meeting, chaired by party leader <PERSON> Nicolae </PERSON> <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON>, will discuss `` directives regarding <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>'s socio-economic development in the 1991-95 five-year period, as well as long-term guidelines until 2000-2010,'' the news agency said. The meeting also will approvie programs on the `` development of revolutionaty worker's democracy, the growing role of the Romanian <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> in ideological and political activity ... and the fundamental characteristics of the present international situation,'' <PERSON> Agerpres </PERSON> said. The meeting is the first since <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> in April made a surprise announcement that it managed to pay off a foreign debt which in 1981 stood at $ 11 billion. The price, however, was steep. For nearly a decade, communist authorities sharply rationed food, gasoline, electricity and other essentials. Dissent over government policy was suppressed by one of the world's most efficient police forces. Now that the debt is paid off, there is no word yet whether this will translate into better lives for Romanians. Western commercial officials said in addition to the traditional problems encountered in trading with a centralized economy, Romanian industry has been starved of investments and is plagued with breakdowns and supply problems. Romanian economists said <LOCATION> Bucharest </LOCATION> would like to expand its trade with developing countries by offering better financing. The session would also discuss <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>'s stand on foreign policy developments prior to next week's <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pact </ORGANIZATION> summit in <LOCATION> Bucharest </LOCATION>, which will draw the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc's party general secretaries, including Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>.

 Eight women arrested for baring their breasts on a city beach pleaded innocent Tuesday, saying a state law that permits men to go shirtless discriminates against women. Ten women were charged on Saturday with exposure of person, a violation under state law. Two defendants did not enter pleas and were rescheduled to appear Wednesday. The women, dubbed the <ORGANIZATION> Topfree </ORGANIZATION> 10, said the state law that permits men to go shirtless in public is unconstitutional because it discriminates against women. `` Because the law is unjust, I plead not guilty,'' <PERSON> Kathie </PERSON> <PERSON> Reilly </PERSON> told Judge <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Manning </PERSON> <PERSON> Regan </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Rochester </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Court </LOCATION>.

In 1986, Judge <PERSON> Herman </PERSON> <PERSON> Walz </PERSON> dismissed the charges against the women, saying they were expressing their right to free speech by exposing their breasts as a form of protest. The women have been having `` Topfree Equality Picnics'' for the past four years. In 1987 and 1988 they were not arrested.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said Tuesday he would not exhort the Polish and Hungarian people on his visit to their countries next month to take actions that might invite repression. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said there was no reason for Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> to get `` uptight'' about the trip. `` I want to see a much more open <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` And I think that the importance of the visit is along that line. It's not going to be that we're going to solve the problem of the Hungarian economy or the Polish economy.'' At a wide-ranging news conference, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> took a relaxed view of U.S.-Soviet competition and <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s own travels to the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION>. For instance, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` it was a good thing'' that the Soviet leader went to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> earlier this month. `` It's a good thing for him to go to <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, and it's a good thing for the president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to go to <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` I want to see us move beyond containment.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will visit <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> July 9-11, stopping both in the capital, <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION>, and in <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION>, the port city on the <LOCATION> Baltic </LOCATION> where the Solidarity labor movement spurred economic and political change in the Communist government. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will go on from there to <LOCATION> Budapest </LOCATION>, the capital of <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, for a July 11-13 visit also designed to accelerate economic and political change in the most liberal of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s East European allies. He will be the third <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> president to visit the region while in the White House. The others were <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he would bring an economic package to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and had discussed <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> legislation to carry out the undisclosed plan with Sen. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. However, the president stressed <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> support for the Polish economy would require further reforms there. In any event, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said in regard to both <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> that `` being there is the significant thing. It is important that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> show its interest in these countries that are undergoing change. You do n't want to overexhort. You do n't want to overpromise. You do n't want to rally people to levels of political activity that might cause repression.'' At the same time, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said the trip, which precedes his participation in an economic summit meeting in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> with the leaders of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, was not designed to send a signal to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. `` I would not expect them to be uptight about it,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` Mr. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> goes to <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and is well-received. And I will go to <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and I will be well-received.'' The pace of change in both <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> has accelerated since <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> scheduled his trip. Solidarity has won 99 of 100 <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> seats in two rounds of elections as well as all the contested races for the lower house. In <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, the Communist leadership chose as party chairman <PERSON> Rezsoe </PERSON> <PERSON> Nyers </PERSON>, a prominent advocate of democratic change, and appointed him to a new four-man ruling body dominated by such advocates. A <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the developments in both countries were welcomed and unlikely to affect <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s trip much. However, the official said, there is `` a lot of nervousness'' in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> about whom Gen. <PERSON> Wojciech </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON>, the likely president in a new government, will appoint to be prime minister. `` It's the sort of thing that happens when you get into a democratic system,'' the official said. `` Democracy is less tidy. And yet, we're relaxed about this.'' In <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, he said, the changes were expected. `` The reform elements are clearly more in control,'' the official said. `` The situation looks like it will be relatively stable at least until the party congress'' in the fall. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> described his intentions in the two countries this way: `` What I want to do is make clear where the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> stands in terms of our respect for freedom, encourage reform as much as possible, and then offer some specifics where we can help on the economy. ... We will support those that move toward us economically, politically and in terms of human rights. And it's more on those general themes that I will be talking to the Hungarian leaders and the Polish leaders.''

 A prematurely dropped anchor may have contributed to an 800,000-gallon oil spill in the <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> that had hundreds of workers today gathering blobs of `` black Jell-O'' that mechanical skimmers could n't suck up. The spill was one of three that occurred in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> waters over the weekend. More civilian and military workers were pressed into service this morning to clean up the <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> oil, and the state sued in federal court to recover damages from the owners of the Uruguayan tanker that caused the spill. In <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, Tropical Storm <PERSON> Allison </PERSON> slowed the cleanup of a 240,000-gallon spill in the <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> Ship Channel. Off <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, most of the estimated 420,000 gallons of oil from a grounded <LOCATION> Greek </LOCATION> tanker no longer threatened the shore. Officials in charge of the <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> cleanup were concerned about a forecast for 95-degree heat, which could liquefy the oil. `` When we've got it in chunks, we can pick it up; when it's flowing, you ca n't pick it up with a pitchfork,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> Capt <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Murdock </PERSON>. More than 500 people, including 300 <ORGANIZATION> Delaware </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guardsmen </ORGANIZATION>, and 22 boats were involved in the cleanup today. In <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Oney </PERSON> said this morning that <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> was sending 150 more Guardsmen. `` So far, we've recovered 63,826 gallons from the spill,'' <PERSON> Oney </PERSON> said. In the search for the causes of the spills, two Coast Guard hearings began this morning. In <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, the pilot of the tanker Rachel-B, which collided with an oil barge owned by <ORGANIZATION> Coastal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Towing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>, testified that he was unable to make a proper turn from the <LOCATION> Bayport </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Channel </LOCATION> into the <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> Ship Channel. `` It could have been caused by too much sediment in the channel,'' pilot <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Gale </PERSON> said. In <LOCATION> Providence </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> R.I. </LOCATION>, Capt. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON>, a harbor pilot, testified that he radioed three warnings to the tanker that ran aground but could not be certain the message was received. Gov. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> DiPrete </PERSON> testified that he asked the tanker captain, <PERSON> Iakovos </PERSON> <PERSON> Georgoudis </PERSON>, `` Why were you in that location which requires a pilot to be on board?'' `` He said, ` That was my mistake,''' <PERSON> DiPrete </PERSON> said. `` He made no bones about it.'' Coast Guard Capt. <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said no evidence of mechanical failure had been found. Along 20 miles of the <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, workers in boats scooped up blobs of congealed oil larger than basketballs, stuffing the goo into large trash bags. Skimmers dispatched after the Uruguayan tanker <PERSON> Presidente </PERSON> <PERSON> Rivera </PERSON> ran aground Saturday jammed in the dense oil blobs. `` It's like black Jell-O, it's horrible,'' said <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Monigle </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Castle </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Del. </LOCATION>, as he watched workers from the shore. A lawyer representing the insurance company covering the <PERSON> Presidente </PERSON> <PERSON> Rivera </PERSON> says the spill was caused by the crew dropping anchor prematurely as the ship prepared to dock at the Sun Oil terminal in <LOCATION> Marcus </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hook </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>. Attorney <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Degen </PERSON> said after the ship swung around to pick up the anchor, `` the decision was made to turn the ship around and head to <PERSON> Marcus </PERSON> <PERSON> Hook </PERSON> In the course of turning the ship around, the bow struck the bottom.'' <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> officials scheduled a hearing Wednesday in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> on the spill. Federal officials said shoreline damage in <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> was light because the oil congealed instead of spreading across the surface of the water. Winds and tides spared <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>. Delaware Fish and Wildlife officers found about 25 <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> geese soaked with oil Monday near the mouth of the <LOCATION> Christiana </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, which feeds the <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Oney </PERSON> said. In <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, there had been some reports of lobsters killed and several small birds found dead, but officials said those did not appear to be widespread. Some state beaches were being reopened today. A statewide shellfishing ban remained in effect, and seafood prices increased. <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Pariseau </PERSON>, manager of Handrigan Seafood, said wholesale steamer claims jumped from $ 55 to $ 85 a bushel during the past week, while flounder went from 40 cents to 95 cents a pound. At retail, flounder filets that cost $ 4.49 a pound 10 days ago were selling for $ 5.99 a pound. No more than five percent of the oil that spilled from the World Prodigy after it hit a reef remained floating, officials said Monday. `` The worst is over,'' said <PERSON> Debbie </PERSON> <PERSON> Payton </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oceanographic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atmospheric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>. `` There's not going to be any more shoreline impacts like there were at the beginning.'' In <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, the storm slowed the cleanup, but workers have been able to collect nearly 4,000 or the 6,000 barrels of oil. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, a spokesman for President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> accused the oil industry of moving too slowly on oil-spill cleanup technology and said the three spills highlight `` the pervasiveness of the problem.'' Presidential press secretary <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said the administration has proposed legislation to give tanker owners `` first level of responsibility'' for paying cleanup costs. He ruled out a moratorium on new oil drilling and exploration.

<HEAD>Diplomat Willie Star, Found on Guam, Puzzled by Fuss over Whereabouts</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Willie </PERSON> <PERSON> Star </PERSON>, the roving ambassador from <LOCATION> Nauru </LOCATION>, was found Tuesday on the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> territory of Guam and seemed puzzled by the recent hullabaloo in the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> over his supposed disappearance. T.W. Star, known to his friends as <PERSON> Willie </PERSON>, is officially listed as ambassador to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Nauru </LOCATION>, a tiny island republic in the western <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION>, but has n't been seen in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> since he presented his diplomatic credentials to President <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> nine years ago. The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> had been sending letters and diplomatic cables for several weeks in an unsuccessful attempt to find Star _ rumored to be living in <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> or the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> _ to determine whether he's interested in becoming dean of the diplomatic corps, a ceremonial post traditionally held by the senior resident ambassador in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. Finally, on Tuesday, an <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> reporter in <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION> located Star by telephone at the <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Star </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hotel </ORGANIZATION> on <LOCATION> Guam </LOCATION> in the western <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION>, where he said he has served as <LOCATION> Nauru </LOCATION>'s consul general for the past year. He sounded puzzled over the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s search for him. Asked if he is still the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassador from <LOCATION> Nauru </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Star </PERSON> replied: `` I do n't think so. I do n't know. I'll have to talk to my government.'' Then he hung up. <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Dunham </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s diplomatic and consular section laughed when informed of Star's whereabouts. As small nations sometimes do, he said, <LOCATION> Nauru </LOCATION> had failed to follow the customary practice of informing the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> of a consular appointment. `` This is unusual, but everything about this case has been unusual,'' <PERSON> Dunham </PERSON> said. Ordinarily, he said, foreign governments inform the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> of consular appointments through their embassy in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, but <LOCATION> Nauru </LOCATION> does not maintain an embassy here. Star's wife, reached by telephone Tuesday in <LOCATION> Guam </LOCATION>, said her husband had never lived in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> Star's presence on <LOCATION> Guam </LOCATION> apparently also went unnoticed because the territory's affairs are administered by the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> has no representative on <LOCATION> Guam </LOCATION>. Mrs. <PERSON> Star </PERSON>, speaking to a reporter in her husband's absence Tuesday, said <PERSON> Star </PERSON> previously had served as <LOCATION> Nauru </LOCATION>'s consul general in <LOCATION> Melbourne </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>, and the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> capital of <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> before he was moved to <LOCATION> Guam </LOCATION> about a year ago. The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s manhunt for Star began shortly after the retirement last month of <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>'s popular ambassador, <PERSON> Wilhelm </PERSON> <PERSON> Wachtmeister </PERSON>, who had been dean of the diplomatic corps for three years. Under protocol rules, the honorary post goes to the foreign ambassador with the most seniority in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, based on the date the envoy's credentials were presented to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> president. The dean, who receives no extra pay, represents other ambassadors at ceremonial functions and in dealings with the host government over diplomatic immunity, parking privileges and other collective concerns. After <PERSON> Wachtmeister </PERSON> retired, the deanship passed to the next eligible ambassador, <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Jacovides </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>, who was promptly summoned home for a foreign ministry job. Next in line was <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Sukru </PERSON> <PERSON> Elekdag </PERSON>, but he is retiring Then the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> turned to Star, the ambassador from <LOCATION> Nauru </LOCATION> who had been doubling as consul general in <LOCATION> Melbourne </LOCATION>. A letter was dispatched to Star via the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Embassy in <LOCATION> Canberra </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>, informing him of his opportunity to become dean of the diplomatic corps provided he takes up residence in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. Star never responded. The embassy had no luck finding him. <PERSON> Stan </PERSON> <PERSON> Ifshin </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> desk officer for <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> island affairs, said that the department will await clarification from <LOCATION> Nauru </LOCATION> about whether Star is still <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassador. `` I do n't believe he is,'' <PERSON> Ifshin </PERSON> said. If Star does n't take the deanship, it probably will go to the ambassador from <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Verde </LOCATION>, an island republic in the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> off the West African coast.

<HEAD>Judges Adhering to Federal Guidelines, Study Finds</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Judges are adhering to federal guidelines designed to end disparities in criminal sentences, the chairman of the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Sentencing Commission said Tuesday. More than 82 percent of the sentences handed down by federal judges fall within the guidelines in effect since Nov. 1, 1987, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilkins </PERSON> said at a news conference. He said his conclusions were based on a random sample of 25 percent of the guideline cases handled over a 16-month period ending March 31. More than 9 percent of the sentences were below the guidelines and nearly 3 percent above it, he said, adding that more than 5 percent fell below the guidelines because defendants provided substantial assistance to the government. <PERSON> Wilkins </PERSON>, a federal appeals court judge, said the system was working well and represented `` a dramatic improvement'' over earlier sentencing. The commission was established because federal judges were giving widely different sentences for similar crimes. The law enacted by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in setting up the panel mandated that defendants convicted of similar crimes receive similar sentences. `` Critics have predicted that guideline sentencing would bring the justice system to its knees, inducing an avalanche of trials by defendants who previously would have pleaded guilty,'' <PERSON> Wilkins </PERSON> said. However, he said, more than 90 percent of the more than 7,000 defendants sentenced under the guidelines pleaded guilty.

 Hundreds of Cambodian refugees who fled a camp controlled by communist <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> guerrillas will be returned to the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> Thai </LOCATION> security official said today. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, however, <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON> said the Thai government confirmed to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials that the refugees will be allowed to remain in non-communist resistance camps. She said the action followed strong appeals from <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials to the Thai government that the refugees not be placed back under <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> control because their safety could not be assured. `` The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> goverment continues to be strongly opposed to the return of these Cambodians to <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> control,'' she said. The estimated 600 refugees now are in a camp run by the non-communist <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>, widely accused of human rights violations in areas under their control, have asked that the refugees be returned. But the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Border Relief Operation has insisted the Cambodians be allowed to decide where they want to live. The refugees had fled the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> camp of <LOCATION> Kaiche </LOCATION> after it was attacked in mid-April. It was unclear why there were conflicting accounts about the fate of the refugees. The Thai official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said that as a `` compromise,'' the military decided the refugees should be moved to Site 8, the only <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> camp where the guerrillas have allowed aid officials to give refugees full medical and other services. Site 8 is north of <LOCATION> Kaiche </LOCATION>, which is along the Cambodian border and in <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>'s eastern <LOCATION> Trat </LOCATION> province. The Thai official did not say when the transfer would take place. A Western relief official, also speaking on condition of anonymity, called it a `` face-saving'' decision in which the military would avoid criticism for returning the refugees to Kaiche yet still support the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>, the largest of three guerrilla groups fighting <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>'s Vietnam-backed government. The official said some refugees `` have reasons to flee <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> control.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> killed hundreds of thousands of people when it ruled <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> from 1975 until Vietnamese forces invaded and ousted it from power in late 1978. The group fled to the border, established camps just inside <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> and allied itself with guerrillas of the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> and of Prince <PERSON> Norodom </PERSON> <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON>. Violations reported in <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> refugee camps have included forcing children to porter arms through mine fields and denying people emergency medical treatment. The relief official called the flight of the refugees to <PERSON> Sok </PERSON> <PERSON> Sann </PERSON> one of the largest escapes from a <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> camp in recent years. The refugees fled after gunners inside <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> shelled <PERSON> Kaiche </PERSON> and the nearby Ta <PERSON> Luan </PERSON> camp in April. Relief officials believe hundreds of people were hurt, but the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> refused to allow any to be evacuated to outside hospitals. In early May, the guerrillas moved several thousand refugees from Ta Luan closer to the border, evidently to prevent the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> from carrying out a plan to move them to a new, safer site.

 The junk bond market, already troubled by the prospect of an economic slowdown, could suffer a heavy blow if <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> adopts legislation forcing savings and loans to sell the high-risk, high-yield securities, economists say. Nevertheless, members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> upset about the wave of corporate takeovers and leveraged buyouts are determined to push thrifts out of the lucrative, but speculative, investment. `` The question ... is simple,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Leach </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Iowa </LOCATION>. `` Should the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> taxpayer subsidize leveraged buyouts, takeover artists and large corporate mergers?'' <PERSON> Leach </PERSON> is one of the chief backers of a provision, sponsored by Rep. <PERSON> Byron </PERSON> <PERSON> Dorgan </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.D. </LOCATION>, in House-passed <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; L legislation. It would forbid thrifts from buying junk bonds and force those that already own them to sell within two years. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> version is more lenient. It maintains the current rule restricting the junk bond holdings of federally chartered S & amp; Ls to 11 percent of assets. It extends the limit to state-chartered institutions, but allows them to exceed it if they can come up with extra capital. A House-Senate conference begins work in two weeks to resolve the many differences, including the provisions affecting junk bonds, in comprehensive legislation to bail out out and reform the S & amp; L industry. High-yield, high-risk bonds, which are often used to finance hostile corporate raids and management buyouts, are nicknamed junk bonds because they have no or a low credit rating. Commercial banks already are forbidden to invest in the bonds, but thrifts have been allowed to buy them since the early 1980s. Relatively few thrifts own junk bonds _ only 161 S & amp; Ls in 36 states, a little more than 5 percent of all S & amp; Ls, according to a report this spring by the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>' auditing agency Most of those have relatively small investments. Ten thrifts account for three-quarters of the industry's investment, and only seven have junk bond portfolios exceeding the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>'s proposed limit. But those numbers, according to economists, understate the extent of thrift involvement in junk bonds and the potential ripple effects of <PERSON> Dorgan </PERSON>'s amendment. Between 1985 and 1988, S & amp; L junk bond holdings increased by 136 percent to $ 13.2 billion _ representing about 8 percent of the entire junk bond market, according to the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION>. Economists warn that if the <PERSON> Dorgan </PERSON> amendment becomes law, junk bond prices likely will fall and investors, including the <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Ls themselves, will get stuck for the losses. `` I think it's going to be very painful for a lot of these thrifts,'' said economist <PERSON> Elliott </PERSON> <PERSON> Platt </PERSON> of <PERSON> Donaldson </PERSON>, <PERSON> Lufkin </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jenrette </PERSON>. `` Investors who hold junk bonds are going to have to monitor this legislation very, very carefully.'' Those who defend allowing thrifts to own junk bonds say such investments have been unfairly criticized. For all practical purposes, a thrift buying a junk bond is taking no more risk than a thrift making a commercial loan, they say. Secondly, they say, junk bonds offer high returns and they allow <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Ls in economically troubled regions to diversify by purchasing bonds from companies in healthy regions and industries. Economist <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Getman </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> WEFA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, a <PERSON> Bala </PERSON> <PERSON> Cynwyd </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, consulting firm, said junk bonds have been among the most profitable activities for thrifts. WEFA studied thrifts and junk bonds for the <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Capital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Access </ORGANIZATION>, a group representing junk bond issuers and investors. Junk bond critics say the bonds have never been tested by a recession, when losses from defaults are likely to rise, offsetting profits from high-interest earnings. They also say extensive junk bond investment by thrifts diverts money from home mortgages and could allow collusion between S & amp; Ls and securities firms selling the bonds. The largest S & amp; L investor in junk bonds is <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Beverly </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, which owns about $ 4 billion, representing 35 percent of its portfolio. According to published reports, the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> has been investigating allegedly unlawful trading arrangements between <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's largest underwriter of high yield securities. `` Junk bond holdings are one of the areas of most abuse,'' said economist <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Aubrey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> G. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lanston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, a government securities dealer in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` I as taxpayer do n't want to be the ultimate guarantor of a sweetheart deal between an <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; L and an investment firm.''

<HEAD>Trial Set for Mom Accused of Giving Cocaine to Fetus</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SANFORD, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A woman charged with giving her baby cocaine while she was pregnant will be tried next month, despite arguments by defense lawyers that drug laws do not apply to the unborn. Circuit Judge O.H. <PERSON> Eaton </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> refused to dismiss charges against <PERSON> Jennifer </PERSON> <PERSON> Clarise </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, 23, who gave birth in January to a girl with traces of cocaine in her system. In 1987, she gave birth to a son who also was exposed to cocaine. The unmarried mother is believed to be the second in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> to be arrested under the drug-delivery law, normally used to prosecute drug dealers. It carries a maximum 30-year sentence. The other woman, <PERSON> Toni </PERSON> <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON>, 29, was arrested after giving birth in November to a boy with traces of cocaine in his system. Ms. <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON> appeared in court Monday and pleaded no contest to possession of cocaine. Prosecutors dropped te delivery charge and charges of child abuse, saying her case posed technical problems. She faces 22 months to five years in prison. Ms. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> refused to comment after her hearing Monday before Judge <PERSON> Eaton </PERSON>, who schleduled her trial for July 26. She said earlier she was sorry but did not believe criminal prosecution would help her. She lives at a drug treatment center and her aunt and mother care for her four children. Assistant State Attorney <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Deen </PERSON> contends that such prosecutions are a way to hold mothers responsible for drug use. `` She's had this -LRB- drug -RRB- problem for many years, and she continued to have cocaine babies,'' <PERSON> Deen </PERSON> said Tuesday. `` That's one of the reasons we decided to prosecute this case.'' But her lawyer and attorneys for the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> contend the drug-delivery law applies only to people and a fetus is not a person under the law. Babies of cocaine-using mothers are usually born prematurely, have lower birth weights, face a greater risk of being stillborn and have a higher rate of neurological problems, according to medical research.

<HEAD>Question on His Grandchildren Strikes a Presidential Nerve</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> fielded questions on <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, abortion and flag-burning with ease Tuesday but was hard-pressed to explain why his grandson, and not his granddaughters, gets to go on the presidential fishing trips. `` When they get older than about 3 I will do that,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> replied with a tone of consternation about why 13-year-old first grandson <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was getting all the perks. The president said <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> `` plays ball and ... does stuff'' that his younger sister, brother and cousins ca n't yet handle. Actually, four of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s seven granddaughters are older than 3, including <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON>'s 11-year-old sister <PERSON> Noelle </PERSON> and 7-year-old twin cousins, <PERSON> Jenna </PERSON> and <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON>. Unlike <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON>, they have n't spent the past two weeks camped out at the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, flying with their grandfather to fish in the Grand Tetons or donning a tuxedo to attend a Kennedy Center extravaganza. Neither have <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s three other grandsons, who are ages 5, 4 and 3. The question from <PERSON> Jessica </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Today </ORGANIZATION> about the handsome teen-ager <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> calls his `` pride and joy'' struck a nerve in what was otherwise an unflappable performance by the early-rising president. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> squeezed in the 9 a.m. EDT news conference on short notice before a ceremonial welcome for the visiting prime minister of <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was asked when it would be the girls' turn to go fishing or `` on some of these kind of excursions where you're doing the business of the nation, to prepare them to be president?'' The girls are `` a little young to go fishing in <LOCATION> Jackson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hole </LOCATION> ... and put up with <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> and all these people,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> replied, referring to his staff. `` I want them prepared for the real world. I'm serious,'' said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, adding that <PERSON> Noelle </PERSON> had `` a wonderful time'' on her last visit to the White House in April. `` My affection for our oldest grandson is just that he's there and he's ready and he plays ball and he does stuff,'' said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. `` We're going to the <ORGANIZATION> Orioles </ORGANIZATION> game tomorrow, I think it is, but it is not discriminatory. It is not discriminatory.'' Prematurely revealing plans to attend the Wednesday night baseball game in <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION>'s Memorial Stadium was one of the few slips <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> made. It was <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s 16th formal news conference and his first in nearly three weeks. The relaxed president held forth for almost 45 minutes, taking five `` last'' questions before finally heading out the door. No, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, he wo n't ask Chinese Prime Minister <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Peng </PERSON> to return the cowboy boots <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> gave him in February embossed with the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> flag. `` And I hope he does n't ask for his bicycles back either,'' said the president. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> made a speech Monday decrying spouse abuse and other violence against women. Asked if he intended to take that message to `` macho'' groups such as the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rifle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> shot back, `` Hey listen, I'm a member of the <ORGANIZATION> NRA </ORGANIZATION>. You're hurting my feelings, as they say in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>.'' He said the Soviets should n't be `` uptight'' about his upcoming visit to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, just as he did n't mind the raves Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> got on his tour of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. `` I feel comfortable about the wavelength we're on with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> now,'' said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. He cited small things that make him feel that way: the Soviets dispatching a ship to help clean up the oil mess in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> sending the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>'s crack burn team to help victims of a pipeline explosion in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he wo n't be rushed into an early summit with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> just for appearances' sake. `` I've been around this track long enough to know that you can always whip out something to sign, a fishing agreement or something of this nature,'' he said. But he added that if there was no major treaty in the offing, `` Maybe we'll do it like this: say, ` Hey, let's get together.''' He was a little more demonstrative than he wanted to be when asked about the Senate-passed child care bill that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> disagrees with. `` I've got to be careful of these gestures, the way these _ <PERSON> Rich </PERSON> <PERSON> Little </PERSON> and these guys _ `` he said, referring to comics who have had a field day with both the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> syntax and body language. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> dodged _ or tried to _ only one question, when asked about <ORGANIZATION> Cincinnati </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reds </ORGANIZATION>' manager <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> and his betting case. `` Baseball, the national pastime, has sound rules regarding betting on baseball games and I simply am ... not going to get into that one,'' said the president.

The latest victory means a $ 500 bond and a trip to the nation's capital with her `` trash stash'' invention for another round of competition. The device, inserted in the rear deck of a car below the back windshield, is a slot with a swinging door that allows trash to be dropped into a bag in the trunk. The bag is easily changed when full. `` Our car is always a mess,'' <PERSON> Amy </PERSON> said. It was the car's littered floorboard which provided her with the inspiration to build the device. Invent America is sponsored by the non-profit <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Patent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Model </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> based in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, to encourage schoolchildren to be inventive. After state competitions, five regional winners are chosen for each grade kindergarten through eighth. So <PERSON> Amy </PERSON> will compete against four other 7th graders in the national finals July 22-27. This week, <PERSON> Amy </PERSON> must send her invention to Patent Model Foundation. Her working model of the invention includes the actual rear deck of a car surrounded by plastic foam to resemble a cutaway section of a car. She said she plans to seek a patent on her invention in hopes of getting rich.

 Sick of slow service? Incensed by indifference? Does bad food leave you bummed, pal? Well, for a paltry $ 2.25, you do n't have to take it anymore. Just use a Consum-Alert sticker. The stickers can be applied on the window _ or the employee if you're that angry _ of the offending business. They are n't permanent _ they use static cling and can easily be removed and leave no sticky residue. The black and gold flourescent stickers are the idea of radio announcer <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Flynn </PERSON> and ad agency owner <PERSON> Greg </PERSON> <PERSON> Fischer </PERSON>. `` I can only say there have been ample opportunities in my life in the last six months where I could have used one of these things and felt justified in doing so,'' <PERSON> Flynn </PERSON> said Tuesday. `` We live in a time where it's so easy to be treated like a number.'' `` The ultimate goal is to just be able to vent ourselves,'' <PERSON> Fischer </PERSON> said. Purchasers get six decals to an order. Black letters say: `` Consum-Alert Warning! This Business Has Been Targeted By Your Fellow Consumer For'' one of four offenses. White letters on a black background indicate the offense: `` Slow Service,'' `` Poor Service,'' `` Bad Attitude'' or `` Poor Hygiene.'' There are two Poor Service stickers and two for Bad Attitude. Instructions with the stickers claim `` the feeling of self-respect and vindication you get is exhilarating.'' The stickers should be placed, according to the instructions, in a `` high-visibility, eye-level location for your Consum-Alert. Put that sucker where everyone can see it!'' The instructions do n't encourage confrontation. The pleasure of relieving frustration should be sufficient. `` You've joined the ranks of <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hood </PERSON> and The Lone Ranger. Be proud.'' Some of the proceeds from the sale of the stickers will go to the <ORGANIZATION> Better </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION>, although <PERSON> Flynn </PERSON> admits `` We hope to make money on this.''

 The West German government has agreed to a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> request to expel an Iranian diplomat involved in a German company's sale of poison-gas chemicals to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration said Tuesday Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> told visiting West German Foreign Minister <PERSON> Hans-Dietrich </PERSON> <PERSON> Genscher </PERSON> about the sales during a luncheon last week, said <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON>. <PERSON> Genscher </PERSON> said he knew nothing about the incident, Ms. <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON> said. The company, to circumvent stricter West German export controls, bought the chemicals from a business in <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, another administration official said. The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, declined to name the West German company. The diplomat in charge of the chemical acquisition was identified as <PERSON> Said </PERSON> <PERSON> Karim </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Sobhani </PERSON>, an official of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s trade mission. Ms. <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON> said it was understandable that West German officials do n't know about every sale by every West German company. She also said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was satisfied with the West German response, but does n't view the case as closed. News of the incident comes as <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> considers several proposals to enact sanctions against nations and companies that sell chemical and biological weapons. The proposed legislation was prompted by revelations last year that West German companies sold <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> equipment for production of chemical weapons. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> tightened its export control laws as a result of the ensuing furor. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> used chemical weapons during their nine-year war that ended last year. Use of the chemical weapons prompted the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to join with its allies in seeking to halt sales of any chemicals that can be used by Third World countries as weapons.

 Preliminary evidence indicates no wrongdoing in the second death of a sailor within 16 months in training pools at <ORGANIZATION> Pensacola </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Naval </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Station </ORGANIZATION>, a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said Tuesday. `` It appears the safety procedures were followed to the letter'' before Friday's death of <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Fedie </PERSON>, 22, a naval aviation officer candidate from <LOCATION> Altoona </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wis. </LOCATION>, said Cmdr. <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Hessler </PERSON>, public affairs officer for the <ORGANIZATION> Naval </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> and Training Command. That was n't the case with the March 2, 1988, death of Airman Recruit <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Mirecki </PERSON>, 19, of <LOCATION> Appleton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wis. </LOCATION>, who drowned during an intense rescue-swimmer drill. <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> officials were secretive about investigations that led to disciplinary action against five enlisted instructors and an officer in <PERSON> Mirecki </PERSON>'s death. `` In this case it is sort of looking like there's nothing like that, so we are being more forthcoming,'' <PERSON> Hessler </PERSON> said, but he emphasized that everything was still preliminary. <PERSON> Fedie </PERSON> collapsed in shallow water while walking from a pool after an abandon-ship drill, a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said. In the exercise, trainees jump from a 12-foot tower wearing flight suits and boots and swim 15 yards underwater to simulate avoiding burning fuel on the surface. As early as Saturday, the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> disclosed preliminary autopsy data that indicated <PERSON> Fedie </PERSON> died of acute cerebral edema, a swelling of the brain and excess fluid that can be caused by lack of oxygen. <PERSON> Hessler </PERSON> said <PERSON> Fedie </PERSON> was conscious after being pulled from the water. <PERSON> Fedie </PERSON> was questioned to determine if he was coherent, and was able to tell rescuers who he was and give his class number, <PERSON> Hessler </PERSON> said. In response to a question, <PERSON> Fedie </PERSON> said he did not hit his head on anything, and the preliminary autopsy also indicated no evidence he had hit his head, <PERSON> Hessler </PERSON> said. But <PERSON> Fedie </PERSON> then went into convulsions and lost consciousness, <PERSON> Hessler </PERSON> said. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation and oxygen were administered at poolside before an ambulance took <PERSON> Fedie </PERSON> to the <LOCATION> Pensacola </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Naval </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> where he died. <PERSON> Fedie </PERSON> was a strong swimmer and had passed a physical examination June 9, <PERSON> Hessler </PERSON> said. One possibility is that <PERSON> Fedie </PERSON> may have had a pre-existing medical condition that failed to show up during the exam, <PERSON> Hessler </PERSON> said. Final autopsy results are expected in a couple of weeks, but <PERSON> Hessler </PERSON> was uncertain if they would be made public.

<TEXT>
 Efforts by Premier <PERSON> Andreas </PERSON> <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON> to form a coalition government from his hospital bed ended Tuesday with a rebuff from the communist alliance. A medical bulletin issued by his doctors said the health of the 70-year-old Socialist was `` continually improving.'' He was hospitalized Thursday for pneumonia, eight months after undergoing heart surgery, and developed kidney and heart complications. <PERSON> Harilaos </PERSON> <PERSON> Florakis </PERSON>, leader of the Coalition of the Left and Progress, said proposals from <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Panhellenic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION> were `` just as interesting'' as those made last week by <PERSON> Constantine </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitsotakis </PERSON>, leader of the conservative <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democracy </ORGANIZATION> party. <PERSON> Florakis </PERSON> said he favored a `` widely accepted'' government `` not be headed either by <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON> or <PERSON> Mitsotakis </PERSON>.'' His coalition is an alliance of the <ORGANIZATION> Greek </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Greek </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Left </ORGANIZATION>, a Eurocommunist group. Negotiations began after inconclusive elections June 18. Officials of <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON>'s party did not disclose their proposals, but said one condition was that he lead the government. New Democracy had offered the alliance the Interior and Justice ministries, but the communists rejected <PERSON> Mitsotakias </PERSON> as head of the government. Doctors said <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON>'s heart condition was under control and he was being treated successfully with a kidney dialysis machine. The premier sent a representative to meet with the communists. New elections may be held soon if a government can not be formed. The communist alliance said it would support an effort to create a national unity coalition. New Democracy won 145 seats in the 300-seat unicameral parliament, six short of a majority. <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON>'s Socialists, hurt by scandals in recent months, got 125 seats and the communist alliance 28. <PERSON> Mitsotakis </PERSON> could not obtain communist support in the time allowed and the Socialists were given their turn Friday, but negotiations were delayed until Monday because of <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON>'s condition. <PERSON> Florakis </PERSON> said he would meet with leaders of both major parties about the possibility of a broad coalition.

 The 11-year-old Californian flying around the world in a small plane is getting VIP treatment in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, but his hoped-for meeting with President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> remains in doubt. <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Aliengena </PERSON> said Tuesday if he does meet the Soviet leader, he knows exactly what he will say: `` Hello, <PERSON> Comrade </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, I'm happy I flew to <LOCATION> Russia </LOCATION>,'' he pronounced in Russian. Meanwhile, the pilot and his family are staying in an exclusive hotel normally reserved for members of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. Their `` Friendship Flight'89'' was the subject of an article in Pravda, and they held a news conference Tuesday in the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> press center where senior government spokesmen usually give briefings. The youngster is scheduled to meet unidentified officials at the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> on Wednesday. He hopes to present <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> with a friendship scroll signed by 250,000 <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> children. `` We're still expecting wonders, we're expecting various surprises,'' said <PERSON> Gennady </PERSON> <PERSON> Alferenko </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inventions </ORGANIZATION>, a Soviet foundation that helped sponsor the flight. After the news conference, <PERSON> Aliengena </PERSON> visited <LOCATION> Red </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION>, where two years ago West German teen-ager <PERSON> Matthias </PERSON> <PERSON> Rust </PERSON> got a very different reception. Rust gained worldwide attention and more than a year in Soviet prison for piloting his small plane past Soviet air defenses and landing in Red Square. The Californian took off in his blue-and-white <ORGANIZATION> Cessna </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Centurion </ORGANIZATION> from <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> on June 5. His flight plan will take 47 days and 19,000 miles in short hops averaging three hours each. On July 1, <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> is to fly on to the <LOCATION> Volga </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> city of <LOCATION> Kuibyshev </LOCATION> and stop in at least eight <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> cities before eventually cross the <LOCATION> Bering </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Straits </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>. He is collecting signatures of Soviet youngsters to present a friendship scroll to President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on his return. The boy said Tuesday he undertook the trip because `` When I got done crossing the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, I wanted to fly around the world, and my dad said I had to come up with a good reason, so I came up with the friendship idea.''

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s `` visceral'' reaction to a <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> decision on flag burning echoes the emotional response by the four dissenting justices and millions of other Americans. And as <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> demonstrated in 1988 _ to the undying regret of <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> _ defending the flag against would-be desecrators also is good politics. The same emotion that moved Justice <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> to read a dissenting opinion in court last week, and that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> cited in his news conference Tuesday, is on display in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> where Republicans and Democrats already are rushing to overturn the court's ruling. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, in calling for a constitutional amendment to undo the court's June 21 ruling _ that burning the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> flag is a protected form of political protest _ described the flag as a `` unique national symbol.'' <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>, like the president a decorated World War II veteran, used that exact language in the dissenting opinion he read from the bench in a voice filled with emotion. He said if the `` ideas of liberty and equality'' that motivated war heroes are worth fighting for `` it can not be true that the flag that uniquely symbolizes their power is not itself worthy of protection from unnecessary desecration.'' <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> is n't concerned with the next election, but that makes him unusual in a hotly debated issue which links the court, the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and now the president. The president's successful 1988 presidential campaign emphasized patriotic values, and included a much-publicized visit to a factory where <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> flags are made. He also attacked Democratic opponent <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, the governor of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, for vetoing a bill that would have required public school teachers in that state to lead daily pledges of allegiance to the flag. The lesson has not been lost on Democrats. One Democratic member of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Applegate </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, said of the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruling, `` I'm mad as hell. What in God's name is going on <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> should be outraged.'' Even new House Speaker <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>, D-Wash., who later said he does not favor a constitutional amendment to outlaw flag burning, called the decision `` deeply offensive. But <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> reacted angrily Tuesday when reporters suggested that Republicans could make flag burning a partisan issue if Democrats fail to push for a constitutional amendment. `` I'm sure people will play politics with any emotional issue,'' <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> said. He added that trying to capitalize on the flag-burning flap would be `` playing the most cynical politics ... for the most base and crass political purposes.'' But he also said a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee would soon conduct hearings on the various congressional proposals. In the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, a resolution opposing the decision passed 97-3. The dissenting votes belonged to Democrats <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Metzenbaum </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> and Republican <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON>, one of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>'s bedrock conservatives, has announced he will not seek re-election. The court's decision dealt with symbolic speech. Some may consider the president's response a form of symbolism as well. To date, emotional reactions have overwhelmed substantive discussion. Just what, and who, did the ruling protect? The court overturned the conviction of a man charged with burning a flag _ not with stealing that flag, or trespassing, or disturbing the peace, or threatening anyone's safety. Nothing in the Constitution would protect him from those other charges. People have a right to burn their flags as a means of self-expression even if it offends most people, the court said. But that constitutionally protected right does not apply when it's someone else's flag, on someone else's property, or someone else is endangered Some day somewhere in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, someone so disturbed by high taxes might take a miniature <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> flag into the backyard and set it afire. Should that be a criminal act? Five <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> members who apparently would view that act as the equivalent of an angry letter said no. Four high court members who apparently would view that act more as conduct than expression said yes. The constitutional amendment backed by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> would permit criminal prosecution of that backyard protester.

 A Palestinian prisoner in a desert detention center killed two inmates, the army said Tuesday, and police suggested the victims may have been accused of collaborating with Israeli authoritiies. In the occupied territories, <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> troops wounded at least 29 Palestinians when they opened fire on stone-throwers, hospital officials said. Four victims were 11 years old, they said. Aides to Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> said he will meet Palestinian leaders from the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> next month to discuss his election plan. The killings in <LOCATION> Ketziot </LOCATION>, a <LOCATION> Negev </LOCATION> desert jail for Palestinian security prisoners, were discovered when the men failed to report for morning roll call, said an army official, who can not be identified under military rules. Police said the men may have been killed as suspected collaborators. But the army spokesman said the killer may have been avenging the 1985 killing of a friend. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio said a prisoner confessed to the slayings, which raise to four the number of inmates killed by fellow prisoners in the past two weeks. <ORGANIZATION> Itim </ORGANIZATION> news agency said the victims were strangled, and police are investigating whether the killer had accomplices. Those killed were identified as <PERSON> Mahmoud </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdul </PERSON> <PERSON> Abedgalla </PERSON>, 24, and <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Hijazi </PERSON> <PERSON> Taaf </PERSON>, 30. Both are from the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. Also Tuesday, <PERSON> Tarek </PERSON> <PERSON> Salih </PERSON> <PERSON> Awad </PERSON>, 17, died of bullet wounds from a Saturday clash with <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> troops, said officials at <LOCATION> Mukassed </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> east </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>. The army confirmed the death. His death increased the toll to 537 Palestinians killed since <PERSON> Arabs </PERSON> started revolting against <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> occupation in December 1987. Sixy-eight have been killed as collaborators by fellow Arabs. Twenty-three Israelis also have died. In <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, Israeli troops opened fire on stone-throwing demonstrators in <LOCATION> Rafah </LOCATION> town, wounding 21 Palestinians, doctors said. Victims include a 17-year-old with a bad head wound, they said. Three other Palestinians were wounded in <PERSON> Khan </PERSON> <PERSON> Yunis </PERSON> refugee camp, three in Shati refugee camp and one each in Nuseirat and Bureij camps, hospital officials said. An army spokeswoman confirmed three injuries in <LOCATION> Rafah </LOCATION>, all from plastic bullets, and said troops were forced to open fire when a large crowd began hurling stones. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Avi </PERSON> <PERSON> Pazner </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> leader will meet Palestinian leaders in July, but declined to reveal their names. <PERSON> Pazner </PERSON> denied <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> media reports that some Palestinians at the talks will be supporters of the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> considers the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> a terrorist organization. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s plan calls for elections to select <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> representatives from the occupied lands to open peace talks with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. The proposal has been rejected by the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> and prominent Palestinians in the territories who say it does not recognize their aspiration for an independent state. Hard-liners in <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> bloc want the proposal amended because they say it could lead to creation of a Palestinian state.

<DATELINE>PASADENA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A pioneering space probe suggested <ORGANIZATION> Saturn </ORGANIZATION>'s largest moon might be covered with an ocean of liquid natural gas, but scientists who bounced radar off its surface say it may have some dry land or an icy surface. `` We interpret our results to mean that the surface of Titan is highly variable,'' planetary scientist <PERSON> Duane </PERSON> <PERSON> O. </PERSON> <PERSON> Muhleman </PERSON> said in an announcement issued Monday by the <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION>. Titan, nearly twice as massive as <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>'s moon, is one of only three moons in the solar system known to have atmospheres. The others are <ORGANIZATION> Jupiter </ORGANIZATION>'s moon Io and <LOCATION> Neptune </LOCATION>'s moon <ORGANIZATION> Triton </ORGANIZATION>. Data from Voyager 1 in 1980 suggested that methane and ethane, components of natural gas, condense in Titan's mostly nitrogen atmosphere and rain on the surface, leading some scientists to believe Titan might be covered by up to a mile of liquid ethane and methane. <PERSON> Muhleman </PERSON> and his colleagues bounced 360,000-watt radar signals off Titan during three 5 -LCB- - hour periods on June 3, 4 and 5 An ethane-methane ocean would have low reflectivity, creating weak radar echoes. Instead, they found strong radar echoes during one observation period and weak echoes during the other two while Titan rotated on its axis. That suggests Titan has oceans in some places and a solid surface in others.

<TEXT>
 A <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> freight train derailed Tuesday, forcing the shutdown of a gasoline pipeline that exploded and leveled a neighborhood last month in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bernardino </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, a fire official said. No injuries were reported in Tuesday's accident north of downtown <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION>, said fire department spokesman <PERSON> Evert </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>. Workers for the <ORGANIZATION> Calnev </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pipeline </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> shut down the pipeline shortly after the derailment, <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> said. The line, which parallels the tracks at the point of the derailment, did not appear to be damaged. Twenty-one cars derailed, narrowly missing some trailer homes. Most of the cars were empty, although some were carrying gravel, officials said. The pipeline carries much of the area's gasoline and diesel fuel supply from <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> refineries to storage tanks on the northern edge of <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION>, where it is distributed to local dealers. Two lines in the pipeline were shut down, said <PERSON> Calnev </PERSON>'s spokesman <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Kline </PERSON>. Both lines were drained as an added precaution. Calnev spokesman <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Kline </PERSON> said the lines could be reopened within a matter of hours once the safety of the lines was assured. It was not immediately known when the lines would be turned on again, officials said. On May 12, a Southern Pacific freight train speeding from <LOCATION> Cajon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pass </LOCATION> jumped the tracks in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bernardino </LOCATION>, plowing into a row of houses. Calnev officials checked a pipeine paralleling the tracks in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bernardino </LOCATION> and said the line was safe. But the Calnev line ruptured May 25, torching 22 homes. A total of six people were killed in the two incidents and 42 were injured.

<HEAD>Bush Says Normal Ties with China Impossible</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE GEDDA</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said Tuesday that <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> remains a country of strategic importance to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> but a ` normalized relationship'' is impossible so long as <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> authorities continue their harsh crackdown on dissent. At a news conference, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also expressed regret over <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s decision not to accept <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> volunteers for the time being `` I'm sorry that the Chinese have made that decision,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. Meanwhile, Chinese authorities gave 11 Americans associated with a religious order until Friday to leave the country. Last Saturday, officials seized religious materials from the group. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, in his appearance before reporters, maintained the same posture on overall <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy toward <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> that he embraced after the crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators three weeks ago. `` It's impossible at this moment to have what I would say are normalized relations, for various, very obvious reasons. But I am going to do my level best to find a way to see improvement there that will help the <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> people,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. On the other hand, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he can not ignore the strategic side of the relationship with <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. He said <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> is important not only because it is a neighbor of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> but also because it is able to exert influence in such senstive areas as <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> peninsula. Citing what he said were the gains in relations with <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said tens of thousands of <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> have studied here _ `` 30,000 students right this minute'' _ and go back home `` with a sense of what freedom and democracy are all about.'' The ties with <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> also helped that country end the isolation of the 1966-76 Cultural Revolution and contributed to the evolution of a much more open economic system, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. With some fanfare, before the upheaval in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> got under way this spring, the two countries signed an agreement for a <ORGANIZATION> Peace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> contingent to go to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> this fall to teach English. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s decision to postpone the arrival of the volunteers is the latest indication of the decline in relations between the two countries. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` If the Chinese say they're not welcome, they ca n't come in And it's too bad, because one of the things that moved forward the reforms was contact with Americans. And I do n't want to see those contacts cut off.'' As for the 11 American ordered to leave, <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials had been concerned that <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> authorities might detain them for carrying out religious activities in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. They had been charged by police with distributing religious literature and were ordered to remain in <LOCATION> Kunming </LOCATION>. The group, associated with the <ORGANIZATION> Latter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rain </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>, of <LOCATION> Litchfield </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, had gone to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> on June 13, ignoring a <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> warning that travel for Americans to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> might be dangerous. They had planned to leave <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> in early July but <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> authorities curtailed their visas, ordering them out of the country by Friday. A 12th American was not ordered out of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> but his multiple-entry visa was taken away, Ms. <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
 An elementary school principal who drafted his own 11-point peace plan said Tuesday he canceled a trip to <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> to promote the proposal because <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> barred him from meeting <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> officials. <PERSON> Assad </PERSON> <PERSON> Saftawi </PERSON> attracted attention with his plan calling for local Palestinians to negotiate an interim autonomy for the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. The plan brought positive reactions from <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> officials who said it indicated Palestinians from the occupied territories are willing to start negotiations without the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, which <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> designates a terrorist group. The officials considered it a favorable response to Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s proposal for elections in the occupied lands to choose Palestinians to negotiate with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> about self-rule. Talks on the final status would be left until later. But <PERSON> Saftawi </PERSON>, headmaster of a school in the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>'s Bureij refugee camp, told Israeli officials he needed <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> approval. `` There is no way that my peace plan will be valid unless the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> looks at it and agrees on it,'' he said. `` But the <LOCATION> Israelis </LOCATION> think that if they let me go and talk to the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> they will recognize the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> in a roundabout way.'' <PERSON> Saftawi </PERSON>, 54, said he is canceling his trip to <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> since the main purpose was to meet <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> officials. He met Monday with <PERSON> Shmuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Goren </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s coordinator for the occupied territories, and conferred last month with Defense Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON>. The <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> meeting was considered significant because of <PERSON> Saftawi </PERSON>'s history as a pro-PLO activist convicted in 1973 for belonging to <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Fatah </ORGANIZATION> faction Fatah official <PERSON> Salah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khalaf </PERSON> was quoted Tuesday as criticizing <PERSON> Saftawi </PERSON>'s plan. The <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> daily <ORGANIZATION> Al-Watan </ORGANIZATION> quoted <PERSON> Khalaf </PERSON> as saying: `` I think we differ with this blueprint because we consider any separation between the elections and comprehensive solution to be designed to serve <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s interests.'' An <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> military official said <PERSON> Goren </PERSON> warned <PERSON> Saftawi </PERSON> he faced prosecution if he violated <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> laws barring contacts with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>. `` We told him that if he wants to go abroad, he can do it. ... If he disobeys the law, however, he will have to take the consequences,'' the official said on condition of anonymity. `` Every Palestinian who asks for permission to meet with <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> officials gets the same answer,'' he added. Violators from the occupied territories can be sentenced to up to 10 years in jail, said an army spokesman. Israeli violators can get up to three years in prison. The attorney general's office said Tuesday it is investigating three Israeli legislators for meeting with <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>. Those under investigation are <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> Members <PERSON> Meir </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilner </PERSON> and <PERSON> Tawfik </PERSON> <PERSON> Ziad </PERSON> and <PERSON> Abdel </PERSON> <PERSON> Wahab </PERSON> <PERSON> Darousha </PERSON>, an Israeli-Arab from the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>.

 <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>'s largest synagogue, nearly destroyed by World War II bombs, will be rebuilt as the center of Jewish worship and culture in the city's communist eastern sector, organizers said Tuesday. The announcement was made at a news conference in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> attended by <PERSON> Heinz </PERSON> <PERSON> Galinski </PERSON>, the leader of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s Jewish communities, along with members of <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>'s Jewish community. They make up a group called the <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rebuilding </ORGANIZATION>, which is coordinating restoration of the synagogue. East German leader <PERSON> Erich </PERSON> <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON> laid the cornerstone for rebuilding the synagogue last year, but workers soon discovered that nearly the entire building will have to be torn down and reassembled. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> has pledged about $ 500,000 toward restoration of the building, but more is needed, said <PERSON> Hermann </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, secretary of the rebuilding association. He said there were no final estimates of the cost. East German officials are counting on most of the cost to be covered by donations. About 173,000 Jews lived in <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> before the Nazi Holocaust. Today, about 6,000 Jews live in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>, and about 300 Jews live in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> synagogue was burned during the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION>' `` Crystal Night'' attacks of Nov. 9-10, 1938, but a policeman saved the building by calling the fire department. Allied bombers virtually destroyed the complex during the war.

 Lawyers working on a new legal hotline for foreign students received dozens of queries Tuesday from Chinese worried about possible danger when they return home after joining in anti-government protests. Some of the callers asked how to get foreign passports or how to defect, said <PERSON> Kohei </PERSON> <PERSON> Sugino </PERSON>, a spokesman for the free telephone service sponsored by the <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION>. The hotline had 74 calls Tuesday _ its first day _ and will operate for two more days, <PERSON> Sugino </PERSON> said. Most of the callers were Chinese, worried that their participation in anti-government demonstrations might endanger them when they go home. `` They are extremely uneasy because <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> grants visa extensions on a case-by-case basis,'' <PERSON> Sugino </PERSON> said. The Japanese <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> has announced it will consider granting individual six-month visa extensions for students who have finished their studies and whose visas have expired. As of June 21, 43 such students had applied, but no one had yet been granted the special extension, said a <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> official, speaking on condition of anonymity. Since <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> does not give blanket visa extensions, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> will be able to find out which students are seeking to avoid going home, <PERSON> Sugino </PERSON> said. He also said some students were concerned about returning home even temporarily. There are rumors going around that students visiting home must report on their political activities to obtain a <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> exit visa to return to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Sugino </PERSON> said the lawyers advised callers on Japanese visa procedures. Government officials say more than 7,700 Chinese students are in Japanese universities or colleges, and another 120,000 Chinese are in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> for business or other purposes.

 Democratic change is so far advanced in <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> that it is conceivable a majority of the Hungarian parliament will become noncommunist in the next two to five years, a <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official told <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> Tuesday. The official, <PERSON> Curtis </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kamman </PERSON>, deputy assistant secretary of state for <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> affairs, told a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Foreign Affairs subcommittee the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration does not believe <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> legislation to reward <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> with a five-year exemption from economic and trade restrictions is needed. He explained that <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> has removed practically all restrictions on the ability of its citizens to travel abroad or to emigrate at will, the objective of the restrictions. <PERSON> Kamman </PERSON> said that while both <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> are building democratic institutions, <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> has drafted a new constitution and has scheduled multiparty local elections for the fall and multiparty national elections next year. `` It is conceivable that within the next two to five years, you could have a majority in the Hungarian parliament that will be noncommunist,'' <PERSON> Kamman </PERSON> said. He said both <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> have permitted more freedom of speech and the press than ever before in modern times.

He said democratic reforms are most advanced in <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and that there have been modest changes in <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION>. The exception is <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>, where he said the political and economic situation appears to be rapidly deteriorating. `` What we see now is that if the promise of reform is kept, <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Europe </ORGANIZATION> will be a very different place: more true to its own historical traditions, more independent and ultimately more prosperous and stable,'' <PERSON> Kamman </PERSON> said. `` It is no longer a bloc but an increasingly interesting and important grouping of individual countries _ each moving forward or sideways or, as in <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>'s case, backwards.''

<HEAD>Soviets May Help to Resolve Mass Migration of Ethnics from Bulgaria</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ANKARA, Turkey (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The Soviet ambassador met with <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>'s foreign minister Tuesday and indicated <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> may try to help resolve problems that have led to the exodus of tens of thousands of ethnic Turks from <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION> `` We are at the beginning of a road,'' Ambassador <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Chernishev </PERSON> told reporters Tuesday after meeting Foreign Minister <PERSON> Todor </PERSON> <PERSON> Zhivkov </PERSON>. `` This diplomatic process will continue.'' In the past month, more than 75,000 ethnic Turks have crossed into <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> to escape an assimilation campaign, the <ORGANIZATION> Anatolia </ORGANIZATION> news agency said Tuesday. The mass emigration followed protests by ethnic Turks in May in which Bulgarian police used clubs and dogs to quell. <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION> said seven people died in the protests, but Western sources say up to 30 died. <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION> then relaxed its emigration policies. Last week, it said 250,000 ethnic Turks had applied for passports and 150,000 of them had received travel documents. <PERSON> Chernishev </PERSON> returned to <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> on Monday after meeting last week with Bulgarian President <PERSON> Todor </PERSON> <PERSON> Zhivkov </PERSON> and gave Turkish officials a message from <PERSON> Zhikov </PERSON>, which he did not disclose. `` <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION> is a Soviet ally. But we also want to improve our relations with the friendly country <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>,'' <ORGANIZATION> Anatolia </ORGANIZATION> quoted <PERSON> Chernishev </PERSON> as saying upon his return. The <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> issued a statement after the meeting and said `` there was no reason to be optimistic yet, but the efforts of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> were appreciated.'' The ministry said the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> was trying to figure out how it could be helpful in solving the problems of ethnic Turks, who make up about 1 million of <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION>'s 9 million people. <PERSON> Chernishev </PERSON> flew to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> on June 21 after <PERSON> Yilmaz </PERSON> summoned him to the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> and reportedly urged the the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> play a more active role in the plight of ethnic Turks in <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION>. Premier <PERSON> Turgut </PERSON> <PERSON> Ozal </PERSON> has called on <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION> to open negotiations on the status of the mainly Moslem ethnic Turks, who were forced to take Bulgarian names and can not speak their own language or practice their religion in <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION> under a 1984 law. <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION>'s ethnic Turks and <PERSON> Christian </PERSON> <PERSON> Slavs </PERSON> have been deeply suspicious of each other since its 500-year rule by the Ottoman Empire. Bulgarian officials blame Turkish propaganda for the exodus. <PERSON> Ozal </PERSON> wants to hold talks with <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> High Commissioner for Refugees for an orderly transfer of ethnic Turks who want to leave <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> wants the ethnic Turks to be allowed to dispose of their property and take their liquid wealth with them. <PERSON> Ozal </PERSON> said Monday the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has been boasting about its social and democratic reforms under <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and that the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION>'s attitude to the problems of ethnic Turks in <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION> would put that to the test. `` Let us see what kind of a democrat <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> is,'' <PERSON> Ozal </PERSON> said in a speech at <ORGANIZATION> Gazi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> here.

<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has bought an additional 400,000 metric tons of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> wheat for delivery this year under the long-term grain agreement between the two countries, the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday. Officials said the sale, by unidentified private exporters, was a straight commercial transaction and did not involve subsidies under the department's Export Enhancement Program. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has bought more than 4.2 million tons of wheat under <ORGANIZATION> EEP </ORGANIZATION> arrangements for 1988-89 delivery, the most recent being 96,000 tons announced on June 23. Although the Soviets had virtually used up the previous <ORGANIZATION> EEP </ORGANIZATION> allocation, a new deal for an additional 1.5 million tons of wheat was announced May 2. Officials said <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> still has 814,200 tons available under the program. A metric ton is about 2,205 pounds and is equal to 36.7 bushels of wheat. According to the latest <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> five-day average, the price of wheat has been $ 3.85 per bushel, meaning the latest sale of approximately 14.7 million bushels could have a farm value of around $ 56 million. Under EEP arrangements, private exporters can sell <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> commodities at reduced prices in order to meet foreign competition in selected overseas markets and then collect free government surpluses of grain or other commodities as bonuses, or subsidies. The sale announced Tuesday boosted to more than 21.2 million tons the amount of grain <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> has bought for delivery in the sixth year of the agreement, which began last Oct. 1. Of that, corn makes up nearly 16.2 million tons, and wheat, more than 5 million tons. In addition, the Soviets have bought 442,500 tons of soybeans; 1.35 million tons of soybean meal; and more than 1 million tons of grain sorghum.

<TEXT>
 An Iranian diplomat accused of coordinating the purchase of chemicals for making poison gas has left the country and wo n't return, the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday. The ministry also said it was investigating a <LOCATION> Duesseldorf </LOCATION> company the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> claims was a broker for the transaction. Spokesman <PERSON> Hanns </PERSON> <PERSON> Schumacher </PERSON> said <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> asked <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> to recall the diplomat after receiving information from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> about his alleged links to the deal, but the man already had left. `` The person in question has not worked at the embassy for some time and will not resume his duties there,'' <PERSON> Schumacher </PERSON> said. He did not identify the diplomat or indicate why he left before the formal request. Informed sources in <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION> identified him as <PERSON> Seyed </PERSON> <PERSON> Karim </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Sobhani </PERSON> and said he had worked at the Iranian Embassy in <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION> since September 1987. <PERSON> Sobhani </PERSON>'s name also came up in the case of <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Walaschek </PERSON>, a West German arrested in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in July 1988 for trying to ship thiodiglycol, which is used in mustard gas, to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Walaschek </PERSON> pleaded guilty and said he bought the chemical at the request of <PERSON> Sobhani </PERSON>. <PERSON> Walaschek </PERSON> later fled the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and officials believe he is hiding out in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Rainer </PERSON> <PERSON> Mueller </PERSON>, another <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, said `` we were informed by the Americans ... last week'' about the <LOCATION> Duesseldorf </LOCATION> company that allegedly acted as a broker. `` We have notified the appropriate departments to take the necessary steps'' for an investigation, <PERSON> Mueller </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> in a telephone interview. <PERSON> Mueller </PERSON>, the ministry spokesman on <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> affairs, refused to name the company and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials also have not identified it. Tuesday's editions of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> said the company acted as a broker in arranging the sale to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> of hundreds of tons of thionyl chloride, which can be used to make mustard gas. It said the gas was to be made by an Indian manufacturer, but most of the chemical was not delivered. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman said Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> told the <PERSON> Hans-Dietrich </PERSON> <PERSON> Genscher </PERSON> about the sales when the West German foreign minister visited the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> capital last week. Late last year, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials accused West German companies of helping <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> build a facility south of <LOCATION> Tripoli </LOCATION> that was described by the Americans as a chemical weapons factory and by <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> as a pharmaceuticals plant. After a long investigation, West German authorities arrested <PERSON> Juergen </PERSON> <PERSON> Hippenstiel-Imhausen </PERSON>, former head of Imhausen-Chemie company. His case is still pending. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> reached a cease-fire with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> in August after eight years of war. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> acknowledged using poison gas during the war, but accused the Iranians of using it first.

<TEXT>
 A federal judge has ordered the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION>, the state and the city to work harder to eliminate racial discrimination in housing in metropolitan <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>. The ruling by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> stems from a lawsuit filed 11 years ago by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> for the Advancement of Colored People against <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Dianne </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilkerson </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> NAACP </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> called the ruling `` a blockbuster _ a whole new world.'' `` This really is a challenge,'' Ms. <PERSON> Wilkerson </PERSON> said Tuesday. `` In the end it's a challenge to -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> Secretary -RRB- <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> has said fair housing is a challenge for his administration. If that's true, they wo n't appeal. <PERSON> Jacqueline </PERSON> <PERSON> Roundtree </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, said agency attorneys were reviewing the ruling and had not decided whether to appeal. The <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fair </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> has found that eight of 10 blacks who look for a home to rent or buy encounter discrimination, Ms. <PERSON> Wilkerson </PERSON> said. Friday's ruling gives them more means to fight back, she said. From 1977 to 1982, <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> said in his ruling, <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> broke federal law by failing to use its grant programs to produce an adequate supply of affordable integrated housing and failing to require effective fair housing enforcement by the city. `` The conditions, exacerbated by <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION>'s pattern of inaction, apparently continue to exist and are currently remediable,'' the ruling said. <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON>'s ruling orders: _ <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> to require that all landlords who get federal aid participate in programs that market suburban housing to low-income minorities. _ <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> to create a Housing Opportunity Clearinghouse that lists available public housing. _ The state to give the <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fair </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> legal authority to issue subpoenas, levy fines and initiate civil actions against discrimination. In 1985, <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> said he agreed with the <ORGANIZATION> NAACP </ORGANIZATION> suit, finding that <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> was aware that <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> had a history of racial bias in housing and that its acute shortage of low-income family housing affected blacks more than whites. However, he dismissed the lawsuit then, saying he lacked authority to review and correct the agency's practices. In 1987, an appeals court said <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> did have authority, and ordered him to reopen the case. Mayor <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Flynn </PERSON> said Tuesday he welcomed the decision and has supported many similar remedies since becoming mayor in 1984. <PERSON> Marcia </PERSON> <PERSON> Hertz </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the Executive Office of Communities and Development, the state housing agency, praised the ruling. `` It actually mirrors the state policies already in place. Our programs and policies all have strong affirmative action components.'' Ms. <PERSON> Roundtree </PERSON> said, `` If you ask whether there's been some improvement in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> since 1978, from a public housing standpoint, our survey and monitoring report in 1987 showed there are still some problems. `` We're not 100 percent where everybody has equal housing but we're moving in that direction, it's probably not as much as the judge wanted.'' Metropolitan <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> refers to an area of 2.8 million people in about 110 municipalities. While 13 percent of <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>'s 573,000 people are black, there are no current figures available on the percentage in the metropolitan area.

 The West German government has agreed to a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> request to expel an Iranian diplomat involved in a German company's sale of poison-gas chemicals to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration said Tuesday Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> told visiting West German Foreign Minister <PERSON> Hans-Dietrich </PERSON> <PERSON> Genscher </PERSON> about the sales during a luncheon last week, said <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON>. <PERSON> Genscher </PERSON> said he knew nothing about the incident, Ms. <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON> said. German authorities undertook an investigation into the activities of the company, a small firm in <LOCATION> Dusseldorf </LOCATION>, said a West German Embassy official. The company, to circumvent stricter West German export controls, bought the chemicals from a business in <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, another administration official said. The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, declined to name the West German company. The diplomat in charge of the chemical acquisition was identified as <PERSON> Said </PERSON> <PERSON> Karim </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Sobhani </PERSON>, an official of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s trade mission. Ms. <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON> said it was understandable that West German officials do n't know about every sale by every West German company. She also said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was satisfied with the West German response, but does n't view the case as closed. News of the incident comes as <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> considers several proposals to enact sanctions against nations and companies that sell chemical and biological weapons. The proposed legislation was prompted by revelations last year that West German companies sold <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> equipment for production of chemical weapons. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> tightened its export control laws as a result of the ensuing furor. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> used chemical weapons during their nine-year war that ended last year. Use of the chemical weapons prompted the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to join with its allies in seeking to halt sales of any chemicals that can be used by Third World countries as weapons.

<TEXT>
 A <LOCATION> Thai </LOCATION> security official said Tuesday that a group of up to 600 Cambodian refugees would be returned to the control of the communist <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>, but the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said that would n't happen. The refugees fled the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> camp of <LOCATION> Kaiche </LOCATION> after it was heavily shelled in mid-April and traveled a few miles to <LOCATION> Sok </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sann </LOCATION> camp, run by the non-communist <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, or <ORGANIZATION> KPNLF </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>, the largest guerrilla group fighting Vietnamese forces in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>, wanted the refugees returned to <LOCATION> Kaiche </LOCATION>. But the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Border Relief Operation and the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION>, which have reported widespread human rights violations in <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> camps, insisted the refugees be allowed to choose where to live. The Thai official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said that as a `` compromise,'' the military decided the refugees should be moved to Site 8, the only <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> camp where the guerrillas have allowed aid officials to give refugees full medical and other services. Site 8 is north of <LOCATION> Kaiche </LOCATION>, which is along the Cambodian border and in <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>'s eastern <LOCATION> Trat </LOCATION> province. He could not say when the transfer would take place. <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> that the Thai government confirmed to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials that the refugees will be allowed to remain in non-communist resistance camps. She said this followed strong appeals from <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials to <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> that the refugees not be returned to <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> control because their safety could not be assured. `` The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> goverment continues to be strongly opposed to the return of these Cambodians to <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> control,'' she said. A Western relief official, also speaking anonymously, called the Thai decision a `` face-saving'' move in which the military would avoid criticism for returning the refugees to Kaiche yet still continue support for the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>. `` The refugees should have individual choice,'' he said. `` Some people have families in <LOCATION> Sok </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sann </LOCATION> and they should stay in <LOCATION> Sok </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sann </LOCATION>. Some have families in Site 8 and they should go to Site 8. Some people have reasons to flee <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> control and they should not be sent to <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> control.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> ruled <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> from 1975 until Vietnamese forces invaded and ousted it from power in late 1978. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> says 2 million people, a fourth of the population, were executed or died of famine in the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>'s attempt to impose radical agrarian communism. The <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> fled to the border, established camps just inside <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> and allied itself with guerrillas of the <ORGANIZATION> KPNLF </ORGANIZATION> and of Prince <PERSON> Norodom </PERSON> <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON>.

 Climbing temperatures on Tuesday melted blobs of heavy oil scattered over 21 miles of the <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> and slowed down cleanup efforts already being challenged in court as too slow. Coast Guard officials revised downward the number of gallons spilled from 800,000 gallons to 306,684 gallons, based on new assessments. A Uruguayan tanker went aground early Saturday, spilling No. 6 industrial heating oil. The oil coagulated in the cool water into chunks, averaging about the size of a basketball but with some up to 2 and 3 feet across. Cleanup workers had been using pitchforks and even their hands to snare the blobs of oil from the water while skimmers, jammed up by the larger chucks, were deployed in areas of the river where there were smaller lumps. The crews also have tried out fishing nets. `` When we've got it in chunks, we can pick it up,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> Capt. <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Murdoch </PERSON>. But on Tuesday, the temperature headed into the 90s, the melting range for the No. 6 industrial heating oil. During an inspection tour, officials pointed to patches where the rainbow hue of petroleum on water showed up and said it was coming from oil blobs close enough to the surface to heat and melt. The melting oil poses a much greater haal Guard, federal government and private contract employees walking along the shoreline and working out of 22 boats snaring the oil blobs. Coast Guard officials said they hoped to have more than 500 people involved in the cleanup Tuesday. But <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lucio </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Delaware </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Natural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> said 207 <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> and private contractor employees were working along with 100 federal government workers. The heat was reaching the point where officials also began to worry about the cleanup workers. `` We ... have to recognize if we work them unreasonably in this kind of weather, we can also do bad things to their health,'' <PERSON> Murdock </PERSON> said.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said Tuesday he accepts some responsibility for recently unearthed Reagan-era problems at the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> since he was vice president at the time. He also said that while he does n't want to jump to conclusions, congressional questioning of people close to him about influence peddling on housing projects `` does n't improve things'' in his relationships with the men. `` If you want to assign blame to the vice president for what happened over the past ... eight years, OK, that's fine, I accept it,'' said the president during a news conference at the White House. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he wants to make sure there is no recurrence of `` cronyism'' and `` special favors'' in awarding government contracts. `` That matter is being looked into by our very able, dedicated Secretary of <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> and we are going to do everything we can to clean up any cronyism or see that matters of that nature not recur,'' said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> has been rocked in recent months by allegations that several <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> insiders and former government officials were paid as consultants and developers in the agency's moderate rehabilitation program. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he would not single out anyone when asked specifically about two men who were key aides in his presidential campaign last year. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Manafort </PERSON>, an adviser to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s 1988 presidential campaign manager, <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON>, told a congressional panel last week that the more than $ 300,000 he earned as a consultant on one project could indeed be characterized as being for `` influence-peddling.'' <PERSON> Frederick </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who was deputy chief of staff for then-Vice President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, no relation, earlier testified before the same panel about his role in another project. He has been asked to make a second appearance this week before the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee on employment and housing to further clarify his company's $ 260,000 consultant's fee on the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jazmines </LOCATION> project in <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>. The president was asked, `` Does this affect your relationship with these people, to know that they were involved apparently in influence peddling?'' `` Well, it does n't improve things, but on the other hand I want to be fair,'' he answered. `` I want to be sure that I do n't jump at conclusions as to what guilt is and what it is n't, whether law was broken or were people just out there, you know, doing what was permitted. `` I want to have the standard higher, though, even if it's permitted I want to have the highest possible standard, but I have n't put it on that kind of a personal basis yet,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. The president praised <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> for his work but sidestepped placing blame on former Secretary <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> for problems at the agency. `` I am not about to prejudge the secretary himself. I assume that he would accept responsibility for what happened _ past tense _ in his department, just as I would have to assume responsibility for something that goes on in my administration whether I know about it or not,'' said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. `` The message has gone out loud and clear to every Cabinet officer that we want the highest possible ethical standards,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> added. <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> Inspector General <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> has said at least a dozen private escrow agents nationwide are under investigation for possible embezzlement of millions of dollars of <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> funds. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he has met with investigators and encouraged independence and thoroughness in their work. His statement came as reports revealed the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> is seeking $ 7.5 million in damages from two agents accused of keeping more than $ 1 million in proceeds from real estate closings there. In <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Marilyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Harrell </PERSON>, an escrow agent dubbed `` <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> HUD'' by investigators, has admitted she stole $ 5.5 million from <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> closings she conducted. <PERSON> Harrell </PERSON> has turned over her <LOCATION> Temple </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, home to the agency to compensate for part of her theft. <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Norton </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney in <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> also is investigating allegations that a suspended <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> accountant embezzled $ 1 million in housing funds. Meanwhile <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> announced $ 89.2 million in new grants Tuesday to private, non-profit and government sponsors to develop 131 projects nationwide in a demonstration transitional housing program for the homeless.

 <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Souther </PERSON> may have been a Soviet spy, but it's unlikely he was a <LOCATION> Russian </LOCATION> mole who infiltrated this country, his former associates said Tuesday after <PERSON> Souther </PERSON>'s death was reported in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. Rather, he was a rambuctious young American who satisfied his craving for attention by defecting to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> three years ago, a decision that may have cost him his life, they said. `` They used him like a spider playing with a moth and when they were going to finish with him, they finished with him,'' said <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Fahey </PERSON>, a professor's wife who knew <PERSON> Souther </PERSON> when he was an Old Dominion University student. <PERSON> Souther </PERSON>, 32, was a former <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> intelligence specialist who disappeared shortly after he graduated from <ORGANIZATION> ODU </ORGANIZATION> in May 1986 with a degree in Russian. He appeared on Soviet television last July and said he had defected. The Soviet military newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Star </ORGANIZATION> reported Tuesday that <PERSON> Souther </PERSON> was a <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION> agent named <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Orlov </PERSON> and that he died unexpectedly June 22. `` There's some attempt to imply that he was really a Soviet-born citizen and became a mole, but that was never really stated and I do n't believe it's true,'' said <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Kessler </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> author who is writing a book on <PERSON> Souther </PERSON>. `` He was in fact a very successful spy,'' <PERSON> Kessler </PERSON> said in a telephone interview from his home in <LOCATION> Potomac </LOCATION>. `` He was an American mole. It's possible that he took this Russian name after he defected.'' <ORGANIZATION> ODU </ORGANIZATION> professors who taught <PERSON> Souther </PERSON> said he was an outgoing, well-liked student who started out poorly in his Russian major. `` There was, throughout the years, not a single indication that he could have been not an American,'' said <PERSON> Leonid </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mihalap </PERSON>, a Soviet-born professor who taught Souther Russian. `` He did not look Slavic and besides he did n't drink vodka.'' But <PERSON> Mihalap </PERSON> said he reread one of <PERSON> Souther </PERSON>'s final papers in Russian and was surprised that it was grammatically flawless except for one misspelling. `` His Russian was better than what I taught him,'' he said. <PERSON> Fran </PERSON> <PERSON> Hassencahl </PERSON>, <PERSON> Souther </PERSON>'s speech professor at <ORGANIZATION> ODU </ORGANIZATION>, said he talked often about his childhood in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> and she met several members of his family. She said she understood that he had married a Russian woman and his mother had visited him in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Kessler </PERSON>, who said he has obtained evidence of <PERSON> Souther </PERSON>'s spying, said he received a letter from <LOCATION> Souther </LOCATION> this month in response to the writer's request for an interview. `` He said, ` According to your letter you have already convicted me of espionage: guilty until proven innocent' and then he said that due to that he did n't want to be interviewed but would respond in writing to questions,'' <PERSON> Kessler </PERSON> said. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Fahey </PERSON>, a retired <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> commander who taught Souther Russian at <ORGANIZATION> ODU </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Souther </PERSON> loved to clown and play pranks. One of <PERSON> Souther </PERSON>'s pranks may have led to his decision to defect, <PERSON> Fahey </PERSON> said. Because he was suspended from <ORGANIZATION> ODU </ORGANIZATION> in 1984 for biting a female student on the neck, <PERSON> Souther </PERSON> was turned down for officer candidate school in the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>. `` He was very bitter about what happened to him as far as the problem on campus,'' <PERSON> Fahey </PERSON> said. `` He really wanted to become a naval officer.''

<HEAD>European Leaders Plan for Monetary Union</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MADRID, Spain (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 European leaders made a deal Tuesday to take the first steps toward economic and monetary union, but Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> fended off moves for a single currency and one central bank. Leaders of the 12-nation <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> fell far short of embracing sweeping proposals that would lead to tight economic integration of the trading bloc. `` We've made as much progress as we can at this stage while leaving longer term issues for further discussion,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> said at the end of a two-day summit. Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> was pitted against French President <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> and West German Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>, who wanted a quick monetary marriage. Despite their differences, the leaders praised the agreement to coordinate more closely their economic and monetary policies. <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> described the summit outcome as `` superb.'' `` The foundation has been laid for a development that brings the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> further together and brings political union one step nearer,'' he said. Spanish Prime Minister <PERSON> Felipe </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> said, `` A week ago, I would have said this would have been impossible.'' <PERSON> Jacques </PERSON> <PERSON> Delors </PERSON>, a top Common Market official who championed radical plans for monetary unity, said, `` I can say the -LRB- community -RRB- is moving forward.'' The leaders expanded the Common Market's drive to fashion a single market by the end of 1992. By that date, the nations hope to remove the many trade barriers that block the free movement of people, goods, services and money. In their final statement, the leaders said they decided `` the first stage of the realization of economic and monetary union would begin on July 1, 1990.'' They asked Common Market officials to complete measures required for the initial phase, which generally stresses greater cooperation on economic and monetary issues. In agreeing only on greater economic coordination, the leaders failed to back wholeheartedly a report, pushed by <PERSON> Delors </PERSON>, setting out three stages for a monetary union. They did, however, agree to start work on a special conference to alter their founding treaty. Such changes would be necessary to set up a European-wide central bank system and joint currency. <PERSON> Delors </PERSON> said the unity movement `` has been started, and I'm tempted to say it's irreversible and will lead to economic and monetary union. Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> said, however, `` There is absolutely nothing automatic about going beyond stage one. All that is for future decisions.'' The leaders also sidestepped the touchy question of a proposed `` Social Charter'' to set out minimum rights for workers in the new European-wide market. Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>, a conservative, had criticized the proposal as a socialist move. `` We have agreed at this -LRB- summit -RRB- that it ca n't be done now and we have said it is all for further discussion,'' she said. But <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> said the plan had not been shelved. The agreement for further discussion, he said, `` constitutes a clearing of the way to continue working for social rights.'' Also Tuesday, the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> leaders called for an embargo on arms sales to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and urged the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> to postpone new loans to that country to protest the government's crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators. They also froze visits by high-level <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> members to <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, extended visas of Chinese students in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and placed limits on cultural and scientific exchange programs. The leaders also called for the participation of the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> in any U.N.-sponsored peace conference on the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>. The declaration spoke of the `` continuing deterioration of the situation'' in the Israeli-occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> and called on Israeli authorities `` to end repressive measures'' in the territories. The 18-month Palestinian uprising against <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> occupation of the territories has claimed 539 Palestinian and 23 Israeli lives. The Israeli Foreign Ministry issued a statement expressing disappointment with the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> declaration. <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> members are <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Luxembourg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>.

 Nine more people were put on trial for rioting during the suppression of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s democracy movement, including one accused of disemboweling a dead soldier, official media reported Tuesday. Also on Tuesday, officials investigated a train explosion that killed 24 people, with state television saying it was caused by dynamite. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s legislature is scheduled to convene Thursday to endorse the hard line against dissent that began with the army assault June 3-4 on pro-democracy demonstrators in Tiananmen Square. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials said <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> had asked the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to delay the start of a <ORGANIZATION> Peace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> program, under which 20 Americans were to teach English in <LOCATION> Sichuan </LOCATION> province. The action was the latest cultural exchange to be threatened or suspended because of the crackdown. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told a news conference in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> on Tuesday that <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> remains a country of strategic importance to <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> but a ` normalized relationship'' is impossible so long as the harsh crackdown on dissent continues. He expressed regret over <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s decision not to accept <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> volunteers for the time being Among the nine defendants in the latest trial, which began Monday in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, was <PERSON> Zhang </PERSON> <PERSON> Jianzhong </PERSON>, 26. The <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> Daily said he took party in the demonstrations since April 17 and, when the army moved in, slit a dead soldier's stomach open with a piece of glass. It said another defendant, <PERSON> Bai </PERSON> <PERSON> Xinyu </PERSON>, set fire to two armored personnel carriers and tried to incite other people to riot. It said <PERSON> Bai </PERSON>, 60, had a criminal record covering 30 years and had served two prison terms for murder. News reports said charges against the seven other defendants included arson, robbery and theft. More than 1,800 people have been arrested for participating in what the government calls `` counterrevolutionary turmoil'' during the June 3-4 army attack in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, and 27 have been executed. The government says 300 people were killed in the assault, most of them soldiers. Diplomatic and intelligence estimates range up to 3,000 and say nearly all the dead were unarmed civilians. Investigators examined the wreckage of a train blown off the tracks by an explosion Monday night on its way from <LOCATION> Hangzhou </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION>. News reports said at least 24 people were killed and 11 seriously wounded by the explosion in a third-class coach about 20 miles from <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s second-largest city. State TV showed a huge hole in the side of the car and said dynamite exploded in a toilet. It was not clear whether the explosion was retaliation for the executions in <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION> last week of three men who set fire to a train that killed six people when it crashed through a barricade set up by protesters. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> is to endorse both the tough new policy and recent changes in the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leadership. On Saturday <PERSON> Jiang </PERSON> <PERSON> Zemin </PERSON>, former mayor and party boss in <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION>, became national party chief in place of <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> <PERSON> Ziyang </PERSON>, who was seen as too soft on the student protesters. Western diplomats said Tuesday that <PERSON> Jiang </PERSON>, an economic pragmatist who supports the aging leadership's rigid position on dissent, ran the propaganda campaign to convince the people the crackdown was necessary. For days after the weekend of violence, television showed `` thugs'' smashing windows of army trucks and setting military vehicles ablaze. An old revolutionary gave a ringing endorsement Tuesday to senior leader <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaoping </PERSON>, 84, who apparently ordered the represssion. While the turmoil allegedly supported by <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> nearly engulfed the nation, `` it is with <PERSON> Comrade </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaoping </PERSON> being at the helm that this matter has been promptly solved,'' former President <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiannian </PERSON>, 80, told a <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> meeting, according to the official news agency <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Wan </PERSON> <PERSON> Li </PERSON>, chairman of the legislature, said it would speed up <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s program of economic reform, which <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> began a decade ago, after studying mistakes that had been made. He said the government was stable and in control, and the unrest `` has made us sober-mindedly draw experience from the past and look forward to the future.'' <PERSON> Helen </PERSON> <PERSON> Qubain </PERSON>, 21, of <LOCATION> Buena </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vista </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Radicia </PERSON>, 25, of <LOCATION> Omaha </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Neb. </LOCATION>, a student and a teacher at <ORGANIZATION> Nankai </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Tianjin </LOCATION>, were accused of being deeply involved in the democracy movement there and were ordered to leave <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> by Friday. Eleven missionaries from an organization called the <ORGANIZATION> Latter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Litchfield </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, were accused of distributing religious literature illegally. They also were given a Friday deadline.

<TEXT>
 The makers of `` Big Wheel'' riding toys will replace the `` on'' switch for 39,000 of the battery-powered vehicles because of possible burns from overheated switches or loss of control due to stuck switches, the <ORGANIZATION> Consumer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Product </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday. The <ORGANIZATION> CPSC </ORGANIZATION> said the free replacement offer by <ORGANIZATION> Empire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carolina </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Tarboro </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, covers toys sold nationwide from 1986 to 1988. The models covered by the replacement offer are <ORGANIZATION> Kawasaki </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> KLT </ORGANIZATION> 250 `` Prairie Big Wheel,'' Nos. 1215, 1220 and 1223, and `` Sweet-Tee-Nuff Big Wheel,'' No. 1221. To get a replacement, owners should call Empire toll-free at 1-800-334-5666, or if in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, collect at 1-919-823-4111.

Box 427, <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> Street Extension, <LOCATION> Tarboro </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION> 27886. The `` on switch'' is on the handlebar and is pushed down to drive the toy, which can travel up to 5 mph. The toy should stop when the button is released. Empire and the <ORGANIZATION> CPSC </ORGANIZATION> said they know of five instances in which the switch overheated or burned out, and one in which the switch stuck and the operator could not stop the toy. Minor burns were reported in two of the incidents.

Six of the nominees were rejected in first-ever confirmation hearings last week by committees of the 542-member Supreme Soviet, which replaced the old rubber-stamp body this year. <PERSON> Ryzhkov </PERSON> also withdrew his nominee, not identified, to head the <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Instrument-Making </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Automation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Equipment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION>, and said he had no nominee to lead the government environmental agency. He could have taken the fight for his first choices to the full Supreme Soviet this week, but said in a speech to the lawmakers that he would submit new candidates. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION>, the official news agency, said the Supreme Soviet later confirmed 60 nominees for posts in government ministries and committees. The new Supreme Soviet is the country's first full-time representative legislature, a branch of the larger <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> Deputies chosen this spring in the first national multiple-candidate elections. The six nominees rejected after committee hearings were Culture Minister <PERSON> Vasily </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Zakharov </PERSON>; <PERSON> Gennady </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bogomyakov </PERSON>, nominee for minister of the oil and gas industry; <PERSON> Polad </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Polad-Zade </PERSON> for minister of land reclamation and water management, a controversial department in charge of dams and canals; <PERSON> Marat </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gramov </PERSON> for head of the sports committee; <PERSON> Lira </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rozenova </PERSON> for the price committee, and <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gribov </PERSON> for head of the central bank. <PERSON> Ryzhkov </PERSON> said candidates for a first deputy premiership and head of a new <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> and Purchases were withdrawn during other committee work. He indicated the nomination of one first deputy premier, <PERSON> Lev </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Voronin </PERSON>, still was active but did not say which of the candidates for the other two deputy premierships, <PERSON> Yuri </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Maslyukov </PERSON> or <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kalashnikov </PERSON>, was dropped. A Supreme Soviet committee rejected <PERSON> Kalashnikov </PERSON> as head of the food commission, however, so he may have been the one. The premier said he had no nominee for the top position at the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nature </ORGANIZATION>, now held by <PERSON> Fyodor </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Morgun </PERSON>. In response to a question, <PERSON> Ryzhkov </PERSON> said four scientists had been offered the job but turned it down. He said nothing about <PERSON> Morgun </PERSON>. In other action in the Supreme Soviet: _ The environmental protection budget will quadruple to about $ 612 billion for the next 15 years, and factories will face pollution fines starting in 1991. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> businesses, citizens and the government spent $ 71.4 billion in 1987 for pollution abatement, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> recently reported. _ The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> will `` work out a political assessment'' of the 1979 decision to send <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> troops into <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> and report to the next session of the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. The Soviet forces, which backed <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> in its fight with U.S.-and Pakistan-supported Moslem guerrillas, were withdrawn in February. _ The legislative agenda for this 40-day summer session includes new laws on consumer protection, inventions, the court system, the press, taxes, citizen associations, the criminal code and economic reform, and first readings of new laws on trade unions, youth, freedom of conscience and religious organizations. Some deputies called for consideration of land-owning _ now reserved exclusively to the government _ and on the state's response to emergencies. The last was apparently in reference to congressional debate on the use of troops to clear a demonstration in <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> in April. At least 20 people died in the Georgian unrest. <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> Lapygin </PERSON>, chairman of the Supreme Soviet committee on defense and the <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION>, told the newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Izvestia </ORGANIZATION> the heads of these agencies will report to his committee. <PERSON> Lapygin </PERSON> also said lawmakers should consider eliminating the military draft in favor of a professional army.

 A 37-ton Hercules cargo plane, salvaged from <LOCATION> Antarctic </LOCATION> ice and snow more than 16 years after it crashed, is set to arrive in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> this week, officials said Tuesday. `` The airplane is just in the final stages of rework at <LOCATION> Air </LOCATION> <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Christchurch </LOCATION>,'' <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> Cmdr. <PERSON> Keith </PERSON> <PERSON> Armstrong </PERSON> said by telephone from <LOCATION> Point </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mugu </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Naval </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Air </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Station </LOCATION>, about 50 miles northwest of downtown <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. The huge, once-icebound LC-130 Hercules is expected to arrive Friday at the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Antarctic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Squadron </ORGANIZATION> 6, the `` Puckered Penguins,'' who fly support missions for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Antarctica </LOCATION>. So far, about $ 4.2 million has been spent to excavate the plane and overhaul it, said <PERSON> Guy </PERSON> <PERSON> Guthridge </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> spokesman in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. An additional $ 2.8 million still must be spent to install new electronic equipment at <LOCATION> Cherry </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Point </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Guthridge </PERSON> added. But that's cheaper than the $ 35 million price tag for a replacement plane. The aircraft is specifically designed and equipped to operate in polar climates, including the use of one-ton, teflon-coated `` wheel-skis'' needed to break the grip of ice on takeoff. `` We left the plane there in'71 because we simply had no capability in place to go back to a remote location in extremely cold weather and retrieve it,'' <PERSON> Guthridge </PERSON> said. The Hercules was one of seven owned by the foundation, and its loss `` affected our ability to install science projects in the field, which really is the payoff of our program,'' <PERSON> Guthridge </PERSON> said. Over a 42-day period the cargo plane was dug from the snow that had buried all but the top 3 feet of the plane's 38-foot high tail and it flew out on Jan. 10, 1988. Much of the time since then was spent in <LOCATION> Christchurch </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION>, where it was inspected and renovated before it is returned to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Guthridge </PERSON> said. `` A lot of people were worried that the stresses induced by the aircraft being covered in snow would damage the air frame,'' <PERSON> Guthridge </PERSON> said. But the salvage crew was surprised to find that the below-zero climate, with air too frigid to carry moisture, had preserved the <ORGANIZATION> Lockheed </ORGANIZATION> aircraft amazingly well, said <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Dabney </PERSON>, a spokesman for the manufacturer in <LOCATION> Marietta </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ga. </LOCATION> `` It was in effect just frozen, with no deterioration in the structure,'' <PERSON> Dabney </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Lockheed </ORGANIZATION> engineers found many of the hydraulic systems were still working, the electronics still worked, there still was air in the tires and fuel in the tanks, <PERSON> Dabney </PERSON> said. The Hercules was abandoned in December 1971 at a remote site, about 700 miles from <LOCATION> McMurdo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sound </LOCATION>, after supplying fuel and other supplies to a scientific team measuring snow accumulation on the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antarctic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plateau </LOCATION>. The field team, part of a joint American, French and Soviet effort, was in a rugged area of high winds and snow accumulation, said <PERSON> Winifred </PERSON> <PERSON> Reuning </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman. The pilot was forced to abort on takeoff after a jet malfunctioned, Ms. <PERSON> Reuning </PERSON> said. The pilot managed a crash landing, damaging the front landing ski and nose of the aircraft. But the crew and several French scientists who were aboard walked away without injury.

 <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s privacy laws should be extended to minors, a lawyer told the state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Tuesday in the case of a teen-ager forced to ask a judge to allow an abortion without parental consent. `` The statute clearly fails to protect a minor's privacy right,'' attorney <PERSON> Jerri </PERSON> <PERSON> Blair </PERSON> told the justices. `` A minor who is pregnant has a right to submit to any medical procedure except abortion under <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> law. `` There is no question it should be applied to the minor's abortion decision,'' Ms. <PERSON> Blair </PERSON> told reporters later The <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> law requires unmarried minors to get permission from their parents or a judge before having an abortion. The case argued Tuesday began when Ms. <PERSON> Blair </PERSON>'s client, a 15-year-old known only as `` T.W.,'' did not want to tell her parents about her pregnancy _ then in its 11th week _ and sought judicial permission for an abortion. A <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> judge denied her request last month, saying the state law was vague and unworkable. An appeals court then ruled the law unconstitutional, and a series of legal maneuvers landed the case in the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, which returned the case to state justices without comment. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> has left the law unenforceable until the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> high court reviews it. Suporters of the law contend it protects the unborn and the right of parents to supervise their children. `` When you elevate the right of privacy over the right to life, you have elevated an inferior right over a superior right,'' said <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Connor </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Tallahassee </LOCATION> attorney for <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> Right to Life. `` Without the right to life, there is no right to privacy.'' Attorney <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Bopp </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> of Terre Haute, <LOCATION> Ind. </LOCATION>, who served as guardian for the fetus, argued that minors are not mature enough to make decisions about abortion. `` I do n't believe the people of <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> intended to subvert parental rights -LRB- or -RRB- to subvert the state's traditional interest in protecting innocent human life, and withdraw the ability of the state to protect vulnerable minors when they adopted the 1980 <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> right of privacy,'' <PERSON> Bopp </PERSON> said. A ruling by the seven justices could be weeks away as the court begins its annual vacation period next month. The court's decision could affect thousands of unmarried pregnant teens and possibly set a broad precedent, attorneys said. Similar privacy issues dominate a case pending before the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> and the original 1973 <PERSON> Roe </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Wade </PERSON> decision giving women the right to have abortions. Before <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s parental consent law was declared unconstitutional, 60 teen-agers received judicial permission for an abortion.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday that rulings by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> upholding the death penalty for youthful or retarded offenders are a step backward for human rights. In two 5-4 votes, the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> said Monday the Constitution's ban on cruel and unusual punishment does not prohibit execution of people who committed crimes as young as 16, or adults with the reasoning capacity of children. `` The imposition of death sentences on juvenile offenders was in clear contravention of international human rights treaties and standards including the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Covenant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Political </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Convention </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION>, both of which the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government signed in 1977 but has not ratified,'' <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> said. The London-based group, which won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1977, said the death penalty was particularly inappropriate for individuals who had not attained full physical or emotional maturity at the time of their crimes. `` To impose the death penalty in such cases, whether as retribution or as an intended deterrent, violates basic principles of humanity,'' the group's statement said. <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> noted that 72 countries that retain the death penalty have abolished it for criminals under the age of 18, including the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Paraguay </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> are among the countries that have executed people who were under 18 at the time of their crimes, <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> said.

 <PERSON> Karoly </PERSON> <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON>, his power curbed in a new four-man leadership dominated by reformers, was quoted Tuesday as saying he plans to resign as <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief next year. <PERSON> Mai </PERSON> <PERSON> Nap </PERSON>, an independent afternoon daily, quoted <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON> as saying in an interview he `` will no longer be general secretary'' after parliamentary elections scheduled for 1990. He has held the post 13 months. `` We have to make room for the younger generation,'' the paper quoted him as saying. `` Obviously, I'll continue to be engaged in politics at some level, but I never again want to be a general secretary.'' <PERSON> Rezsoe </PERSON> <PERSON> Nyers </PERSON>, father of pioneering economic reforms in the late 1960s, was chosen as party chairman Saturday, and a four-man Presidium was formed to run the party until the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> scheduled for Oct. 7. The paper quoted <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON> as saying the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> had `` agreed that we will need to hold -LRB- another -RRB- <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> after the elections as well. It's obvious that there will be a new balance of forces and a new leadership.'' <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON>, considered a centrist, has lost standing recently with contradictory statements. He angered other leading Communists, and many other Hungarians, when he said on television May 30 there was no need to rehabilitate <PERSON> Imre </PERSON> <PERSON> Nagy </PERSON>, who led the 1956 uprising crushed by Soviet tanks, because <PERSON> Nagy </PERSON>'s execution was `` not a party decision.'' A day later, party issued a statement that described <PERSON> Nagy </PERSON> as a forerunner of reform and amounted to de facto rehabilitation. <PERSON> Nagy </PERSON> since has been reburied with honors. <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON> replaced <PERSON> Janos </PERSON> <PERSON> Kadar </PERSON> as party chief in May 1988, heading a new leadership that seemed to strike a balance between reformers and more orthodox Communists. As reformers gained the upper hand over conservatives wary of relinquishing power, <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON> jockeyed unsuccessfully for a middle ground. Communists and democratic opposition groups agreed to cooperate in drafting legislation to govern the first multiparty elections in more than 40 years, and work began June 13. The government has said elections will be held by June of next year, but there have been increasing calls for the date to be advanced.

 The House on Tuesday endorsed and sent to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> legislation that would give final approval to a self-government plan for the <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> islands of <PERSON> Palau </PERSON>. The measure, passed on a voice vote, also provides final authorization for spending of $ 238 million over the next five years, including an immediate $ 36 million payment to cover <PERSON> Palau </PERSON>'s debt for a power plant. `` This is a highly responsible act for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> <PERSON> Udall </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ariz </LOCATION>., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> The measure `` brings an honorable end to a very difficult chapter in the history of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Lugo </PERSON>, the non-voting House delegate from the <LOCATION> Virgin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Palau </PERSON> is the last of four parts of the Trust Territory of the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION>, created following World War II, to define its political status. The plan, called the <ORGANIZATION> Compact </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Free </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, provides self-government in all areas except defense, which is reserved for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> also retains a 50-year right to establish a military base on <PERSON> Palau </PERSON> should it need an alternative to its current bases in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Palau </PERSON> itself has failed in six referendums to approve the compact, and the bill provides another $ 200,000 to hold a seventh referendum. The island nation has been troubled by political corruption, crippling debts and fiscal mismanagement, drug abuse and crumbling public facilities. The legislation would create a anti-drug program for <PERSON> Palau </PERSON> and establishes controls for the spending of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid money. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> acted despite warnings from Rep. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Frenzel </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Minn </LOCATION>., who argued that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> does n't have the money to spend `` We are playing fast and loose with our budget agreement.

In a separate action, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> also approved and sent to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> a bill establishing regular diplomatic relations with two other former <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> trusteeships, the <LOCATION> Marshall </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Micronesia </LOCATION>. The measure would elevate the status of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> envoys in those two island groups to ambassador.

 The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday slashed $ 1.1 billion from President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s proposed Star Wars budget and cut funds for the B-2 stealth bomber to save a <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> aircraft the administration wants to cancel. Beginning full committee action on the $ 295.6 billion <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> budget for fiscal 1990, the Democratic-controlled panel did side with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on some issues. It rejected an amendment introduced by Rep. <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Dellums </PERSON>, D-Calif., to terminate the Midgetman missile program And it voted to restore $ 71 million for the Lance missile and other short-range attack weapons _ money that had been cut by a subcommittee. By voice vote, the full committee approved a $ 3.5 billion budget for the Strategic Defense Initiative, considerably less than the $ 4.6 billion <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had proposed for the Star Wars program to develop lasers and other weapons to stop enemy nuclear missiles. The committee decision came just two months after <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON>, in slashing $ 10 billion from the budget, had already cut $ 1 billion in proposed Star Wars spending. The committee action, if supported in later votes in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, would take $ 1.1 billion more. By a 39-12 vote largely along party lines, the committee rejected an amendment by Rep. <PERSON> Jon </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kyl </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Ariz </LOCATION>., to accept <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON>'s spending level for Star `` I believe the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people will support a strong, robust SDI program,'' <PERSON> Kyl </PERSON> told his committee colleagues before the amendment was defeated. One of <LOCATION> Cheney </LOCATION>'s most controversial budget decisions was scuttling the <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION>' V-22 Osprey, a revolutionary aircraft designed to take off like a helicopter and fly like a plane. His move met with stiff opposition in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> where last week Reps. <PERSON> Curt </PERSON> <PERSON> Weldon </PERSON>, R-Pa., and <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Foglietta </PERSON>, D-Pa., succeeded in persuading the Research and <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Subcommittee </ORGANIZATION> to approve an amendment to pump $ 351 million into the program by taking money that had been earmarked for the radar-evading B-2 stealth Rep. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dickinson </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Ala </LOCATION>., introduced an amendment to restore some of the funds for the bomber But <PERSON> Weldon </PERSON> argued that the amendment `` in effect kills the V-22.'' His argument succeeded as the committee voted 31-19 to reject <PERSON> Dickinson </PERSON>'s amendment. The vote leaves $ 2.7 billion in procurement funds for the B-2 bomber and cuts the proposed $ 1.8 billion for research and development to about $ 1.5 billion. Three committee members _ Reps. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Kasich </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Ohio </LOCATION>; <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Rowland </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Conn </LOCATION>., and <PERSON> Dellums </PERSON> _ plan to introduce an amendment Wednesday to eliminate all money for the aircraft, which is considered one of the most expensive in history at a cost of between $ 500 million and $ 650 million a copy After the committee rejected the administration's requested figure for Star Wars Tuesday, <PERSON> Kasich </PERSON> proposed spending $ 3.8 billion plus inflation on SDI, reaching that level by cutting added items including a proposed $ 200 million for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aerospace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Plane </ORGANIZATION>. The high-speed transport could fly around the world in two hours. <PERSON> Kasich </PERSON>'s amendment lost 32-15, largely along party lines. The panel did n't take up other Star Wars amendments, reasoning that there was no need to engage in rancorous debate at this point over an issue that is expected to reach the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> floor for full discussion next month. At that time, Rep. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Fla </LOCATION>., plans to introduce an amendment cutting Star Wars to $ 3.1 billion, and <PERSON> Dellums </PERSON>, chairman of the subcommittee, plans a measure limiting fiscal 1990 funds to $ 1.3 billion for SDI <PERSON> Dellums </PERSON> said that based on `` the reality over the past few years,'' the research and development total for Star Wars will likely be cut on the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> floor to $ 2.8 billion. The committee on Tuesday also rejected a surprise amendment by Rep. <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Hopkins </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Ky </LOCATION>., to eliminate money for the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>'s light attack helicopter, commonly known as the LHX `` Santa Claus should not come to town every day,'' <PERSON> Hopkins </PERSON> said in response to arguments that funds for Army research and development projects were drastically low and the service deserved a modernized force. His amendment failed, 41-8. In approving the research and development budget, the panel also approved $ 50 million for the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Projects </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> to spend on high definition television. The agency has $ 10 million available annually for the program during the next three years. Earlier, the full <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> committee approved the <ORGANIZATION> Seapower </ORGANIZATION> and Strategic and Critical Materials Subcommittee's budget of about $ 14 billion for shipbuilding, two additional mine-sweepers and other items.

<HEAD>Kidnappings May Have Been a Mistake, Hezbollah Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The kidnapping of foreigners, 14 of whom are believed still held in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, may have been `` a very big mistake,'' said a spokesman for Shiite Moslems thought to be the captors' umbrella group. <PERSON> Ibrahim </PERSON> <PERSON> Amin </PERSON>, the spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>, or Party of <PERSON> God </PERSON> said: `` It is possible that we might feel that some acts might have involved a very big mistake. `` But we have to face our mistakes in the way that preserves and respects our society,'' <PERSON> Amin </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> has repeatedly denied involvement in the kidnappings, and the black-turbaned <PERSON> Amin </PERSON> reiterated those denials at a news conference. But Western and local intelligence sources have linked the organization to extremist groups who claim responsibility in most of the abductions. Hezbollah supported the anti-West policies of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s late spiritual leader and founder of the Islamic republic, <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>, who died of a heart attack on June 3.

<HEAD>Mormons to Dedicate Restored Jail Where Prophet Shot</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Thousands of Mormons gathered Tuesday to dedicate a $ 1 million shrine on the `` hallowed spot'' where church founder <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> and his brother, <PERSON> Hyrum </PERSON>, were killed by a mob 145 years ago. <ORGANIZATION> Mormon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Ezra </PERSON> <PERSON> Taft </PERSON> <PERSON> Benson </PERSON>; <PERSON> Jayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON>, wife of Illinois Gov. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON>, and about 3,000 others attended a ceremony marking the completed restoration of the old <LOCATION> Carthage </LOCATION> jail where <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> died _ a site considered sacred by the world's 6.5 million Mormons. `` Few could foresee the future stature of the man whose blood stained the floor of this jail,'' said <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> Hinckley </PERSON>, first counselor to <PERSON> Benson </PERSON>, as he recounted the shooting of the Smiths on June 27, 1844. `` We are grateful for the reconciliation that has come with the passage of time,'' said <PERSON> Hinckley </PERSON>, who described the founder's death as `` an epic story of martyrdom.'' `` This is a hallowed spot,'' <PERSON> Hinckley </PERSON> said. The five-room, bullet-riddled jail stands as a reminder of the religious persecution of the Mormons and the hatred that drove them from the <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> town of <LOCATION> Nauvoo </LOCATION>, 30 miles west, he said. The two-story stone jail, with its two cells and the bedroom where the <PERSON> Smiths </PERSON> died, has been restored to its 1844 appearance. Bullet holes are still visible in the bedroom door and <PERSON> Hyrum </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>'s blood-stained cloths are on display, along with a statue of the Smiths and six slate monuments inscribed with quotes from <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>. Renovation of the jail, built in 1840, was completed to coincide with the 150th anniversary of the Mormon's settlement in <LOCATION> Nauvoo </LOCATION>, a town of about 1,100 located 200 miles north of <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> that briefly was home to <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>'s followers _ the core of the Church of <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> <PERSON> Christ </PERSON> of Latter-day <PERSON> Sains </PERSON>. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> and his congregation arrived in <LOCATION> Nauvoo </LOCATION> in 1839, when the town was named Commerce. They settled on 1,000 acres in the swamp `` flats'' below the town's main business district. The land was drained and divided into four-acre farm plots. Each member was given an acre for a house, barn and a few animals. Within a few years, a city of 15,000 sprang from the swamp. Named <LOCATION> Nauvoo </LOCATION> by the Mormons _ from the Hebrew for `` beautiful location'' _ it rivaled <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> as the largest city in <LOCATION> Ilinois </LOCATION>. A huge, limestone temple was built on a bluff overlooking the town. But the friction with outsiders that had forced <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> to leave other towns followed the settlers into <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>. Mormons clashed with local residents who rejected <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>'s claims that he had spoken with God, been visited by angels and was a prophet. The conflict eventually led to the arrest of the Smiths and two associates. They were awaiting trial in <LOCATION> Carthage </LOCATION> when the jail was stormed by a mob estimated by some accounts at 125. `` The historic preservation of this site will foster an ongoing growth of tolerance which is <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> said. After the deaths of the Smiths, <ORGANIZATION> Brigham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Young </ORGANIZATION> assumed leadership of the church and two years later led a mass exodus west from <LOCATION> Nauvoo </LOCATION>, eventually settling in <LOCATION> Salt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>.

 <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>'s military government said on government radio and television Monday that it will act under martial law to stop unauthorized organizations from printing and distributing books and pamphlets. The announcement said there were `` 48 unauthorized organizations engaged in activities aimed at disturbing peace and tranquility in the country and also printing and distributing pamphlets illegally.'' The government added that `` 51 similar unauthorized organizations are also operating in the name of students organizations.'' `` Legally registered political and other organizations can apply for registration under the ... law.. and ask for exemption to print and distribute books and pamphlets purely for election purposes,'' it said It said 226 political parties were registered with the <ORGANIZATION> Election </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> and 57 social organizations with the <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> and Religious Affairs. The military government, which seized power last September, has promised a general election next year, <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> rebel sources in <LOCATION> Mae </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sot </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>, said up to 900 Burmese soldiers backed by mortar and artillery fire attacked <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> guerrilla positions close to the Thai frontier before dawn Tuesday. The sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said heavy fighting followed at the <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> base of <LOCATION> Pa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Loo </LOCATION>, about eight miles south of <LOCATION> Mae </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sot </LOCATION>. Soldiers fired hundreds of mortar and artillery shells into <PERSON> Pa </PERSON> <PERSON> Loo </PERSON> and a nearby camp at <LOCATION> Kaw </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Moo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ra </LOCATION>, they said. The <LOCATION> Moei </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> separates the camps from <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>. More than 50 shells fell into <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> near <LOCATION> Pa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Loo </LOCATION> and Burmese machine-gun fire hit three houses and a <ORGANIZATION> Buddhist </ORGANIZATION> temple in <LOCATION> Mae </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kone </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kane </LOCATION> <LOCATION> village </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Thai </LOCATION> border patrol police said, adding that <LOCATION> Thai </LOCATION> security forces returned fire. No casualty reports were available. The Karens are among a dozen ethnic groups in <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION> which for 40 years have fought for greater autonomy. The Karens, with about 8,000 armed fighters, are the largest group. Government forces began a major campaign against the Karens last October.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Line </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pilots </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> asked federal mediators Tuesday to intervene in talks with strikebound <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, a request that could complicate the troubled carrier's plans to reorganize The union made the request of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mediation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> even as it continued negotiations with Eastern in talks ordered by the bankruptcy judge overseeing the airline, which filed for court protection from its creditors after its Machinists union struck in March. A <ORGANIZATION> Mediation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said the request had not been logged in as of the close of business Tuesday. But the union provided a copy of the filing, which the union said was delivered to the board Tuesday afternoon. Most pilots have honored Machinists' pickets lines and under labor law are considered legal sympathy strikers. But the request for mediation could trigger a pilots' strike as well. Nearly 300 <ORGANIZATION> ALPA </ORGANIZATION> pilots have crossed Machinists picket lines but <ORGANIZATION> ALPA </ORGANIZATION> officials contend most of them would refuse to work if their union struck Eastern. Mediation also would add a number of legal and jurisdictional questions that are likely to further complicate <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s legal odyssey. Airline disputes are regulated by the Railway Labor Act, which gives the mediation board broad powers to try to resolve contract disputes. Unions can not strike airlines or railways unless released from mediation, a situation which occurred prior to the Machinists strike. Mediation requests generally are granted as a matter of routine. Eastern last week sough bankruptcy court permission to cancel its contract with the pilots and impose changes in wages and work rules it said it needed to reorganize as a smaller carrier. Parties engaged in federal mediation, however, are prohibited from altering terms of their contracts. <ORGANIZATION> Mediation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Bushnell </PERSON> said he believed a mediation request involving a company in bankruptcy proceedings was unprecedented and could not say what it would mean for Eastern's bid to abrogate the pilots' contract `` If in fact mediation is granted, that issue would probably end up in court,'' said <PERSON> Bushnell </PERSON>. Board procedures call for the appointment of a mediator and a fact-finding process that takes several weeks. The mediator then would arrange sessions between the parties, which already are involved in bankruptcy court proceedings and the contract talks ordered by that court. If the mediator declared an impasse, a 30-day cooling off period would begin after which the union would be free to strike and the airline free to change provisions of existing contracts. Union spokesman <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Cole </PERSON> said the union decided to seek mediation after <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> officials refused to schedule future negotiating sessions under terms of the Railway Labor Act. Those sessions would be separate from the bargaining ordered by the bankruptcy judge. A second meeting under that process was held Tuesday but resulted in no progress, <PERSON> Cole </PERSON> said. Eastern spokesman <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> Matell </PERSON> said company officials believed the bankruptcy court proceedings would supersede the authority of the <ORGANIZATION> Mediation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>. He disputed the union's assertion that <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> had refused to bargain under the Railway Labor Act, saying <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> declined to meet with the union because it has not made a counter-offer to a proposal <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> made three weeks ago. `` We do n't know what they are trying to accomplish with the mediation,'' he said. `` We believe that the bankruptcy court and the examiner are better able to handle bankruptcy-related labor agreements.'' Also Tuesday, <ORGANIZATION> ALPA </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> exchanged a new round of charges and contract charges about whether the carrier will be able to recruit and train enough new pilots to meet its planned summer schedule. The union said its analysis of new pilot hiring and training indicated that <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> would fall at least 236 pilots short, perhaps as many as 358, of the 837 it would need to fly the August schedule it has presented to its creditors. Eastern dismissed the union's conclusions as the product of `` voodoo arithmetic'' and the overall report as part of attempts by the pilots and <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s other unions to force <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> to sell the airline. `` We have no shortage of employees or other staff to fly the schedule,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> Cermesak </PERSON>. `` The criticism of insufficient resources will continue as long as they are on the outside looking in.'' She said <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> had told the creditors committee it would fly 221 flights a day in July but had revised the schedule to 226 flights because of progress in training replacements. Eastern figures indicate that 276 of its pre-strike pilots have been crossing picket lines and about 100 replacements have completed training and begun carrying passengers. More than 500 pilots are in training. Industry analysts have said the airline will be hard-pressed to recruit and train enough pilots to reach 1,700 by the end of the year, the number it would need to meet its reorganization goal.

 A 7-year-old girl who was swept away by fast-flowing water was rescued Tuesday from a storm drain after clinging to the cracks of the sewer's brick lining for more than 12 hours, authorities said. `` She spent the entire night in the city's major sewer system with all that flood water coming in on her, and hardly had a scratch,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Fire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Warnke </PERSON>. `` It's just a miracle that she could still be alive.'' <PERSON> Latricia </PERSON> <PERSON> Reese </PERSON> was playing outside her home Monday afternoon when her young cousin saw her lose her footing in the fast-moving storm water and slip into a 18-inch culvert. She was retrieved around 8 a.m. Tuesday by two construction workers who removed manhole covers near the spot where she disappeared and found her clinging onto some cracks in the brick lining of the sewer, <PERSON> Warnke </PERSON> said. `` I just held onto the crack in the cement,'' <PERSON> Latricia </PERSON> said several hours later from her hospital bed, while watching cartoons and smiling occasionally at friends and relatives gathered around her. Her mother, <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> Reese </PERSON>, said that after <LOCATION> Latricia </LOCATION> slipped into the sewer opening she dropped several levels under the street, twice plunging more than 6 feet before reaching out and clutching a crack in the channel wall. She said <PERSON> Latricia </PERSON> told her she was bothered throughout her ordeal by `` mosquitos and ants and bugs.'' <PERSON> Latricia </PERSON> suffered only abrasions to her knees and elbows and mild shock. She was in very good condition at <ORGANIZATION> Humana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital-Southmore </ORGANIZATION>, said spokeswoman <PERSON> Ramona </PERSON> <PERSON> Branch </PERSON>. Thunderstorms spawned by Tropical Storm <PERSON> Allison </PERSON> dumped about 10 inches of rain in the <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> area. The water was pouring so quickly into the drain where she disappeared that fire department personnel were unable to reach her, or even conduct a proper search Monday, <PERSON> Warnke </PERSON> said. `` The fire department diving team was called out and they refused to go in the hole because the water was just so swift that it was too dangerous,'' he said. `` They thought that at that point, because the water was moving so fast, that she would have been swept down to the place where the sewer system empties into the bayou.'' `` We used a flashlight and saw a little figure about 30 feet under the street,'' said <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Gabrysch </PERSON>, a construction worker who went into the drain. `` It was pitch dark and she could n't see anything. `` I have no idea how she stayed there,'' <PERSON> Gabrysch </PERSON> said. `` It's pretty nasty down there There's all kinds of debris down there.'' `` They began yelling her name, and she answered back: ` Who are you?''' <PERSON> Warnke </PERSON> said. `` They told her and she was reluctant to come outof the hole after being in there all night hanging on through that swift water.'' <PERSON> Latricia </PERSON>'s reactions were initially confused in the hours right after her rescue. `` When they keep asking her what happened, she gets a little foggy about that and you do n't get really clear answers,'' Ms. Branch said. `` She also thought she did n't spend the night there. She thought she went home.''

<UNK>Brazilian Police File Charges Against Super-Investor</UNK>
<DATELINE>SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A multimillionaire investor linked to a financial scandal that shook <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>'s stock markets has been charged on two counts of financial wrongdoing, police said Tuesday. Police questioned <PERSON> Nahas </PERSON> Monday night about his role in the scandal, but the charges filed were unrelated to the crisis, which led to the closing of six brokerage houses, police spokesman <PERSON> Mauro </PERSON> <PERSON> Ament </PERSON> said from <LOCATION> Brasilia </LOCATION>, the capital. <PERSON> Nahas </PERSON> is accused of trying to illegally take dollars out of the country in 1987 and of violating the Financial System Law in 1983, <PERSON> Ament </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Ament </PERSON> said that in December, 1987, police at <LOCATION> Sao </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paulo </LOCATION>'s International Airport found $ 20,000 in <PERSON> Nahas </PERSON>' suitcase as he was about to board a plane for <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> By law, Brazilians then were only allowed to take $ 1,000. In 1983, a construction firm owned by <PERSON> Nahas </PERSON> borrowed the equivalent of $ 12 million from the <ORGANIZATION> Sogeral </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>, of which he was a major shareholder. `` This was a violation of the Financial System Law, which prohibits this kind of transaction,'' <PERSON> Ament </PERSON> said. The spokesman said that if convicted on the charges, <PERSON> Nahas </PERSON> faces an 11-year jail term. Federal police also questioned <PERSON> Nahas </PERSON> on his alleged role in the stock market scandal that broke June 9, but <PERSON> Ament </PERSON> said there was still insufficeint evidence to bring charges against the investor. <PERSON> Nahas </PERSON> bounced $ 31 million in checks to pay for highly speculative deals on the <ORGANIZATION> Rio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> de </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Janeiro </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Brazilian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. On June 12, the government closed all of <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>'s nine stock markets to avoid panic among investors. <PERSON> Nahas </PERSON> was prohibited from leaving the country. The market reopened the next day. The government has closed six brokerage houses involved in the scandal, including one owned by <PERSON> Elmo </PERSON> <PERSON> Camoes </PERSON>, former president of the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Camoes </PERSON> resigned shortly before his brokerage was closed. <PERSON> Nahas </PERSON>, a Lebanese immigrant whose business interests range from mining and farming to real estate and insurance, is a common sight in Brazilian society pages. In 1984 he hosted <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabian </LOCATION> arms merchant <PERSON> Adnan </PERSON> <PERSON> Khashoggi </PERSON> on a visit to <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> also has linked <PERSON> Nahas </PERSON> with <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> billionaires <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> <PERSON> Bunker </PERSON> <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON> and <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON> in their ill-fated try to corner the world's silver bullion market

 The <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> approved legislation Tuesday to sharply limit outside income for city officeholders, a move some say is designed to prevent the Rev. <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> from running for mayor. The bill, sponsored by council member <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> and approved on an 11-2 vote, sets a $ 10,000 limit on income from speeches for the mayor and council chairman and includes an amendment by council Chairman <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Clarke </PERSON> that limits the mayor or council chairman to $ 10,000 income from book royalties. Both <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> and <PERSON> Clarke </PERSON> are running for mayor in the 1990 race. Incumbent <PERSON> Marion </PERSON> <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> has not said whether he will seek re-election. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, who earns most of his income from speeches, has not ruled out running for the $ 82,500-per-year post. `` I am awfully suspicious when two announced candidates put together legislation to keep someone from running,'' said council member <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>. `` We can ... say that this is a <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> bill for sure,'' said council member <PERSON> Nadine </PERSON> <PERSON> Winter </PERSON>. `` We have railroaded a piece of legislation in 19 days only because the political campaign is heating up, and it seems to me we have a problem here.'' <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> and council member <PERSON> Betty </PERSON> <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Kane </PERSON> voted against the measure. <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> denied the bill was meant to keep <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> off the ballot and said he began working on it after constituents complained last year when the council voted itself a pay raise. Council member H.R. <PERSON> Crawford </PERSON> said the honoraria limit would be an unfamiliar concept for most city officials. `` From what I hear in the community, most people would pay us $ 10,000 only to be quiet,'' <PERSON> Crawford </PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
 The families of 38 of the 42 people killed when a fired airline employee brought down a jetliner in December 1987 settled their cases out of court on Tuesday. The settlements came just before final arguments were to be heard in the liability trial against <ORGANIZATION> USAir </ORGANIZATION> and others. Damage cases brought by the families of two passengers, a flight attendant and the pilot remain. Families who did not request confidentiality said settlements ranged from $ 200,000 to $ 3.7 million, attorneys said. The total payment was less than $ 37 million but more than $ 20 million. Evidence presented during the trial included allegations of lax security at both <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> international airports that allowed fired <ORGANIZATION> USAir </ORGANIZATION> employee <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Burke </PERSON> to board <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> Flight 1771 with a .44 - caliber Magnum `` I think we brought out how bad it was,'' said plaintiff attorney <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Wecht </PERSON>, referring to airport security. `` Among other things, this was the first public hearing of this airplane crash. ... I think the public had a right and a need to know about this kind of disaster.'' A telephone call seeking comment from lead defense counsel <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Manfredi </PERSON> was not immediately returned. Forty-three people, including <PERSON> Burke </PERSON>, died in the Dec. 7, 1987, crash. Federal investigators concluded that midway through the flight, <PERSON> Burke </PERSON> shot his supervisor, then entered the cockpit and shot the crew. Minutes later, the BAe-146 four-engine plane slammed into a hillside north of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Luis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Obispo </LOCATION> in an explosive crash. There were no survivors. <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> <PERSON> Foreman </PERSON>, who represented the families of crew members killed in the crash, said the most damaging testimony in the trial came from former <ORGANIZATION> USAir </ORGANIZATION> employee <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Drabik </PERSON>, who loaned <PERSON> Burke </PERSON> the gun used in the shootings and was a <ORGANIZATION> USAir </ORGANIZATION> supervisor in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> at the time. <PERSON> Drabik </PERSON> testified that in November he loaned the gun and 12 rounds of ammunition to <PERSON> Burke </PERSON>, a longtime friend, at <PERSON> Burke </PERSON>'s request. <PERSON> Burke </PERSON> had already been fired by <ORGANIZATION> USAir </ORGANIZATION> for allegedly stealing $ 69 from a petty cash box. <PERSON> Drabik </PERSON> said that on the day he loaned <PERSON> Burke </PERSON> the gun at the airport he helped him get it through security by walking through an employee bypass at the metal detector station while <PERSON> Burke </PERSON> walked through the detectors. Although <PERSON> Drabik </PERSON> insisted that he did not carry the gun through for <PERSON> Burke </PERSON>, he could not explain how <PERSON> Burke </PERSON> could pass through the detectors and not set them off. `` Not one juror we talked to later said they believed that,'' said <PERSON> Foreman </PERSON>. `` It was the most damaging testimony for <ORGANIZATION> USAir </ORGANIZATION>. An employee had knowingly violated security.'' Other testimony came from experts on how <PERSON> Burke </PERSON> managed to sneak a gun aboard Flight 1771 at <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> International. Both sides agreed that <PERSON> Burke </PERSON> used an unreturned employee identification badge to move unchallenged through the airport, but his route to the plane with the gun was disputed. Plaintiffs contended <PERSON> Burke </PERSON> could have simply flashed his identification badge at security guards and used a bypass to avoid metal detectors. Since the crash, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> has tightened requirements for airline employees passing through security areas and regulation of identification badge issues. The settlements came before closing arguments or jury deliberations began in the <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> case overseen by Judge <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ryburn </PERSON>. Defendants included <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, its parent company <ORGANIZATION> USAir </ORGANIZATION>, the city <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airports </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Ogden </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Allied </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION>, the private firm that handles metal detection and passenger screening stations at <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>. By agreement, the <ORGANIZATION> Airports </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> was dismissed as a defendant by all plaintiffs. <PERSON> Wecht </PERSON>, one of the plaintiffs' attorneys, suggested that the remaining cases might eventually be settled out of court as well. `` It was n't feasible for them to settle at this time,'' said <PERSON> Foreman </PERSON>, who refused to elaborate.

 National guardsmen opened fire on villagers protesting a mining operation, fatally wounding a young man, officials reported Tuesday. A National Republican Guard spokesmen said six shots were fired after a guardsman was injured Monday by villagers throwing stones. <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Simoes </PERSON>, 20, was shot in the head and taken to a hospital in <LOCATION> Oporto </LOCATION>, 45 miles away, where he died Tuesday. More than 200 residents of this northern village fought with about 80 armed guardsmen during the protest. <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> is a paramilitary police force, similar to <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION>, that operates mainly in rural areas.

The guard spokesman, whose name was withheld in keeping with regulation, said the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> had ordered an investigation of the use of firearms in the confrontation. At least 12 other villagers and a guardsman were treated at hospitals for injuries siffered in the fighting. Protesters fled into nearby cafes and houses. A villager reached by telephone from <LOCATION> Lisbon </LOCATION> on Tuesday said <PERSON> Barqueiros </PERSON> was calm and `` we're in mourning.'' Witnesses said the mine was operating.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The head of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Churches </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday he's quitting because `` ecumenical dreams'' for the council as a more unifying movement have been blocked. The Rev. <PERSON> Arie </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brouwer </PERSON> said that in recent struggles over council objectives, `` differences in dreams led to the sharpness of the conflict,'' with him favoring fuller integration of the council's operational units. `` I can do no more in this position to fulfill'' that goal, he told a conference. <PERSON> Brouwer </PERSON>, 53, said he would step down Friday as the council's general secretary, a post he has held for four and a half years, the last two embroiled in turmoil over future council directions The council, the country's largest ecumenical organization, includes most major Protestant and Eastern Orthodox denominations totaling more than 40 million members. <PERSON> Brouwer </PERSON>, a tall, quiet-spoken Midwesterner from <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> and a clergyman in the Reformed Church in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, emphasized he was not leaving the council office `` in a spirit of anger or bitterness.'' The conflict over goals boiled to a near breaking point at a May meeting in <LOCATION> Lexington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>, of the council's governing board, which split evenly _ 57 votes to 57 _ over a move to oust <PERSON> Brouwer </PERSON>. He said his resignation `` is a direct result of events precipitated'' at that meeting, which initiated steps to consolidate 11 council units into four, each run by church representatives largely independent of other units. <PERSON> Brouwer </PERSON> said this essentially perpetuated the past loosely linked units, mostly setting their own policies. He had clashed sharply with <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, the council's relief arm and largest operational unit, in trying to bring it into joint administration, efforts that <ORGANIZATION> CWS </ORGANIZATION> strongly resisted At the <LOCATION> Lexington </LOCATION> meeting, <PERSON> Brouwer </PERSON> sharply delineated the conflict, denouncing a tide of `` rumors, innuendo and false charges'' against him. Critics had called <PERSON> Brouwer </PERSON> harsh and autocratic. He said the problem was that he dared speak the truth. `` The powerful are not accustomed to such behavior and they are outraged. They will not have it.'' <PERSON> Brouwer </PERSON> said he spoke out strongly about the matter then because `` I wanted to set it openly before the entire community,'' knowing that doing so involved `` personal vulnerability and professional risk.'' The tie vote over his continuing in his post showed that the governing board could not resolve the issues, he said, and in reflecting about the impasse, he concluded he should resign. `` Under those circumstances, I could not carry further the work which is essential to my vocational fulfillment,'' he said in a written statement. `` To outside observers, this must surely seem to be a time of great brokenness for the council. It is, but it is also a time of healing and binding. The experiences of the past few weeks have in some ways brought us closer together.'' <PERSON> Brouwer </PERSON> was chief executive of the <ORGANIZATION> Reformed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> before he took the council post in 1985 at a time when a special panel had presented plans for making the council a closer-knit `` communion of communions.'' Acknowleging that he had been rebuffed in trying to implement that larger dream, he added, `` That does not, however, mean that I am giving up on those dreams or on the council.'' A statement by other council officers said, `` We profoundly regret the developments in our life together that now deprive our community of <PERSON> Arie </PERSON>'s leadership.'' The Rev. <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> McClurg </PERSON>, a Presbyterian and the council's titular president, said there has been a `` great deal of hurt'' in the conflict, and the council wanted to move forward toward greater unity, but she added: `` This was not the right time We did n't learn to do it quickly enough. We've had some rough sledding. But we have n't given up.'' The Rev. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Methodist </ORGANIZATION> and the council's <LOCATION> Washinton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION> public-policy representative, was named as the council's acting general secretary until <PERSON> Brouwer </PERSON>'s successor is chosen

 Environmentalists on Tuesday rejected a compromise plan that would have preserved the best <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> forest land for the rare Northern spotted owl while freeing enough timber to keep mills operating. The environmental groups, however, said they were willing to continue negotiating toward a solution that would overcome a bitter court battle, which has tied up billions of board feet of timber on federal lands. `` We are talking about the extinction of a species and should n't act precipitously,'' said <PERSON> Andy </PERSON> <PERSON> Kerr </PERSON>, conservation director for the <ORGANIZATION> Oregon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Natural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> `` Conservationists, like misers, may be hell to live with, but we make great ancestors.'' Timber industry officials had said they were willing to accept the compromise offered Saturday by members of the <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> congressional delegation and Gov. <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldschmidt </PERSON>. The proposal called for a short-term increase in the number of trees that could be cut on federal land in <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> while protecting some of the older forests where the rare Northern spotted owl nests. A statement issued by the environmental groups said they could not accept the timber harvest figures in the compromise without more information. `` The proposal was a bittersweet pill,'' <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Spence </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, said at a news conference in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>. `` The simple truth is that less timber means fewer jobs.''

The compromise was offered at the so-called spotted owl summit meeting in <LOCATION> Salem </LOCATION> among representatives of the timber industry, environmentalists, all seven members of <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>'s congressional delegation and Gov. <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldschmidt </PERSON>.

Political foes said it was intended to avert an open power struggle between radicals led by <PERSON> Ahmad </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> and pragmatists led by <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> Speaker <PERSON> Hashemi </PERSON> <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON>, the only announced candidate in the July 28 presidential election. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s official <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> quoted the <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> Times daily as saying the deputies suggested that <PERSON> Ahmad </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> become speaker if he wins an election in <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> constituency. <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON>, who polled 1.3 million votes in last year's parliamentary election, will have to give up his seat in the Majlis, or parliament, to run for president No date has been set for the by-election. `` We call upon your excellency to be in the Majlis ... to become a cause of strength, encouragement and guidance for this important pillar of legislation in the arena of the country's decisions,'' the radio quoted the deputies as saying in a letter to <PERSON> Ahmad </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>. The Iranian news media were monitored in <LOCATION> Nicosia </LOCATION>. The Iraq-based <ORGANIZATION> Mujahedeen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Khalq </ORGANIZATION>, or <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Holy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Warriors </ORGANIZATION>, opposition group said the deputies' offer was aimed at leaving <PERSON> Rafsajani </PERSON> a clear run. Speculation has grown that the politically ambitious <PERSON> Ahmad </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>, 43, would declare himself a candidate for president to run against <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON>. Many analysts said that would lead to an open fight for power between the pragmatists and their radical rivals. The <ORGANIZATION> Mujahedeen </ORGANIZATION> said in a statement telexed from their <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION> headquarters to The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Nicosia </LOCATION>: `` <PERSON> Ahmad </PERSON> has told his aides that if <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> becomes president, that would lead to splits within the regime and its disintegration.'' It said the deputies sent the letter to <PERSON> Ahmad </PERSON> on Sunday and that <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> was a signatory. `` The letter ... reflects the deputies' profound fears that any factional alignment in the presidential elections would lead to the disintegration of the whole regime'' following <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>'s death June 3, the <ORGANIZATION> Mujahedeen </ORGANIZATION> said Analysts believe that if <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> is elected president, he will take over the day-to-day running of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. Once entrenched, his pragmatic faction is expected to maneuver to loosen the government's grip on the economy and to mend relations with the West Such policies are anathema to the radicals. The Mujahedeen say the radicals are engineering to promote <PERSON> Ahmad </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> in the hierarchy to curb the power of their rival camp. The younger <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>, a low-ranking clergyman, has held no official position, but he was a close aide to his father and controlled access to him.

 A nuclear weapons test that had been delayed by fickle wind conditions shook the <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> desert Tuesday with an explosion several times the force of the <LOCATION> Hiroshima </LOCATION> atomic bomb. The blast registered 4.6 on the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale of ground motion at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Earthquake </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Golden </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colo. </LOCATION>, according to spokesman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Minsch </PERSON>.

But the readings were not as distinct as with some previous tests. The test, code-named <LOCATION> Amarillo </LOCATION>, was the second major <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> nuclear weapons test in six days. Energy Department officials deemed the latest shot a success. The device was detonated 2,100 feet beneath the surface of <LOCATION> Pahute </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mesa </LOCATION> on the sprawling desert test range and had an explosive force of up to 150,000 tons of TNT. The blast that destroyed <LOCATION> Hiroshima </LOCATION> had an explosive force of 13,000 tons of TNT. `` The seismograph needle is swinging wildly from side to side,'' <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Boyer </PERSON> said as he monitored the blast in a control center 30 miles from ground zero. The test was originally scheduled for Saturday, then delayed several times because of unfavorable wind conditions. It was rescheduled for Sunday, then delayed again for the same reason. Tests are not conducted if winds are blowing toward a populated area such as <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION> in the event that nuclear radiation escapes the underground cavity where the nuclear device is detonated. <PERSON> Boyer </PERSON> said monitoring equipment surrounding ground zero indicated there was no leak of radiation.

 A federal magistrate's ruling Tuesday cleared the way for just one of <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Haley </PERSON>'s Comets to rock around the clock. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Magistrate <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Jarvey </PERSON> approved a preliminary injunction request by <PERSON> John </PERSON> `` BamBam'' <PERSON> Lane </PERSON> <PERSON> Barrowclough </PERSON> of <PERSON> Crum </PERSON> <PERSON> Lynne </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, a drummer who joined <PERSON> Haley </PERSON>'s band in 1965, to stop a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> man from performing under the name <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Haley </PERSON>'s Comets or any similar name. <PERSON> Haley </PERSON>, one of rock' n' roll's pioneers known for such hits as `` Rock Around the Clock'' and `` See Ya Later Alligator,'' died in February 1981, nearly 30 years after forming the band <ORGANIZATION> Bill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Haley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; The <ORGANIZATION> Comets </ORGANIZATION>. Barrowclough, one of five musicians who comprise the group <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Haley </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Comets </ORGANIZATION>, contended that a group headed by <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Grazino </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Pemberton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, was causing confusion by using <PERSON> Haley </PERSON>'s name and was costing <PERSON> Barrowclough </PERSON>'s band jobs. The complaint was filed after a June 3 performance in <LOCATION> Mason </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> by <PERSON> Grazino </PERSON>'s band, which also bills itself as <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Haley </PERSON>'s Comets. Barrowclough and two partners _ band member <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Rappa </PERSON> and the <ORGANIZATION> Jolly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Joyce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> booking agency _ have held trademark rights to the names <PERSON> Haley </PERSON>'s Comets and <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Haley </PERSON>'s Comets since Oct. 21, 1987. The group claimed trademark infringement, unfair competition and false designation under the federal trademark act. <PERSON> Grazino </PERSON>, who does business as <PERSON> Joey </PERSON> <PERSON> Rand </PERSON> and was referred to as Rand throughout the injunction hearing, did not attend the session nor was he represented by anyone. There is no telephone listing for <LOCATION> Grazino </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Pemberton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, and efforts to reach him were unsuccessful. <PERSON> Barrowclough </PERSON> said he was happy with the ruling and hopes it will clear up confusion among booking agents and fans. `` The market for <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Haley </PERSON>'s Comets is worldwide,'' he said. `` When people come to see <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Haley </PERSON>'s Comets, they do n't know there are, or used to be, two <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Haley </PERSON>'s Comets.'' <PERSON> Grazino </PERSON> received permission from <PERSON> Jolly </PERSON> <PERSON> Joyce </PERSON> to use the <PERSON> Haley </PERSON> name for his performances from Dec. 8, 1981, to Dec. 8, 1984. <PERSON> Barrowclough </PERSON> said that was during a time when he and the agency were fighting each other on the trademark issue and that <PERSON> Joyce </PERSON> had no authority to grant permission. The differences have been reconciled and <PERSON> Joyce </PERSON> no longer books acts for <PERSON> Grazino </PERSON>. `` Rand has never worked with <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Haley </PERSON>, although he states he has. He never appeared with <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Haley </PERSON> ... and to our knowledge he has never even met <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Haley </PERSON>,'' said <PERSON> Barrowclough </PERSON>. <PERSON> Barrowclough </PERSON> and his partnership have asked for triple damages, court costs and any profits earned by <PERSON> Grazino </PERSON>'s band since Dec. 8, 1984, but a hearing on those issues has not been scheduled. The injunction will be in effect until the hearing.

<HEAD>$250 Checks Go to Would-Be Van Winners in Kraft Contest</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Kraft </PERSON> has begun sending out $ 250 checks as consolation prizes for would-be winners of a $ 17,000 van offered in the company's botched `` Ready to Roll'' contest, officials said Tuesday. The food company based in this northwest <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> suburb had planned to give away only one van in the game. But a printing error in newspaper inserts distributed June 11 created hundreds, perhaps thousands, of winning combinations with matching pieces in packages of Kraft Singles cheese. The firm nullified the contest June 12, but offered the $ 250 to those holding game pieces that indicated they had won the van. `` We hope that the actions we're taking will show consumers how much we appreciate their understanding and patience during this situation,'' said <PERSON> Kathy </PERSON> <PERSON> Knuth </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for <PERSON> Kraft </PERSON> <LOCATION> USA </LOCATION>. The checks from the food company are accompanied by letters saying that the company is `` sorry for any confusion or disappointment the flawed game may have caused.'' The grand prize in the game, offered only in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> areas, was a 1990 Dodge Caravan LE worth $ 17,000. Officials of <PERSON> Kraft </PERSON> <LOCATION> USA </LOCATION> _ a division of <ORGANIZATION> Kraft </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foods </ORGANIZATION>, which is part of <ORGANIZATION> Philip </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cos. </ORGANIZATION>. Inc. of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> _ have so far not specified how many people mailed in matching game pieces for the van and other prizes offered `` That information is n't available right now,'' Ms. <PERSON> Knuth </PERSON> said Tuesday. After the error was discovered and the game canceled, <PERSON> Kraft </PERSON> officials announced a modified contest. Claimants were required to have mailed their pieces by midnight, June 16, to qualify for cash and a July 14 drawing for four vans and other prizes. The company also announced plans to send $ 250 checks to van claimants. <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Hearn </PERSON>, 48, of suburban <LOCATION> Brookfield </LOCATION>, got his check in the mail Monday _ just 10 days after he sent in his game pieces. `` Those <PERSON> Kraft </PERSON> people just made a big flub out of the whole deal,'' said <PERSON> O'Hearn </PERSON>. But he said he does not intend to participate in class-action lawsuits against the company. At least two such lawsuits were filed earlier this month, with plaintiffs seeking more than the $ 250 the company offered. `` I can see how a mistake could happen,'' said <PERSON> O'Hearn </PERSON>. `` It's pretty fair what they've done. In addition to the van, <PERSON> Kraft </PERSON> had originally planned to award 100 bicycles, 500 skateboards and 8,000 packages of cheese. Ms. <PERSON> Knuth </PERSON> said that payments have also started going to would-be winners of those prizes _ $ 50 to bicycle winners, $ 25 to skateboard winners and $ 5 to cheese winners. She said she was unsure whether all checks had been mailed. Only one winner is allowed per household, under company rules.

<TEXT>
 Actress <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Beth </PERSON> <PERSON> Hurt </PERSON> testified Tuesday that she urged her then-husband, actor <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Hurt </PERSON>, to marry his pregnant lover but he rejected the idea, saying he would never wed again. `` I'm finished with marriage,'' Ms. <PERSON> Hurt </PERSON> said the actor told her when they discussed his relationship with former ballerina <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Jennings </PERSON> in a September 1982 meeting. She said Hurt had asked for the meeting because he wanted to talk about finalizing their divorce. Ms. <PERSON> Hurt </PERSON> said that, except for a brief reconciliation in 1978, she and Hurt had been separated since 1975 and she asked him why he wanted to complete the divorce at that time. She said he replied, `` Because <PERSON> Sandy </PERSON>'s having a baby.'' `` Do you intend to marry her?'' Ms. <PERSON> Hurt </PERSON> said she asked him. `` No,'' she said Hurt responded. `` I said, ` Marry her, <PERSON> Bill </PERSON>.''' `` He said, ` No. I'm finished with marriage.''' Ms. <PERSON> Hurt </PERSON> testified on the final day of a <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> trial to determine whether Hurt, 39, had a common-law marriage with Ms. <PERSON> Jennings </PERSON>, 32, his former live-in lover and mother of his 6-year-old son <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON>. Ms. <PERSON> Hurt </PERSON>'s testimony appeared to support <PERSON> Hurt </PERSON>'s contention that he never considered Ms. <PERSON> Jennings </PERSON> his wife and never intended to marry her. Later in the day, movie producer <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> Zinnemann </PERSON> testified that <PERSON> Hurt </PERSON> told actress <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Kay </PERSON> <PERSON> Place </PERSON> at a baby shower for Ms. <PERSON> Jennings </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Beaufort </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION>, to `` Mind your own business!'' when she asked whether Hurt planned to marry his lover. <PERSON> Zinnemann </PERSON>, who married actress <PERSON> Meg </PERSON> <PERSON> Tilly </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Beaufort </LOCATION> during the filming of `` The Big Chill,'' said the possibility of a double wedding with Hurt and Ms. <PERSON> Jennings </PERSON> was discussed. <PERSON> Zinnemann </PERSON> said that after their wedding Ms. <PERSON> Tilly </PERSON> threw her bouquet over her shoulder toward Ms. <PERSON> Jennings </PERSON>, who almost caught it but dropped it. The producer said he invited Ms. <PERSON> Jennings </PERSON> and Hurt to be witnesses at his wedding, but Hurt did not show because `` he purportedly overslept.'' Ms. <PERSON> Jennings </PERSON>, a former dancer with the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ballet </LOCATION>, is suing Hurt for divorce, basing her claim on four weeks they lived together in <LOCATION> Beaufort </LOCATION> while Hurt was filming `` The Big Chill.'' Ms. <PERSON> Jennings </PERSON> says the common-law marriage began under <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> law Dec. 9, 1982, when Hurt learned he was divorced. They left <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> Jan. 10, 1983. If state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Justice <PERSON> Jacqueline </PERSON> <PERSON> Silbermann </PERSON> finds there was a marriage, she could give Ms. <PERSON> Jennings </PERSON> a piece of Hurt's income for the past 6 -LCB- years. Ms. <PERSON> Jennings </PERSON>' lawyer, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Golub </PERSON>, says Hurt is worth about $ 10 million. Hurt's former housekeeper-personal assistant, <PERSON> Dianna </PERSON> <PERSON> Schiebel </PERSON>, returned to court Tuesday with a lawyer. The judge had advised her to do so after she admitted taking <PERSON> Hurt </PERSON>'s personal files and giving them to Ms. <PERSON> Jennings </PERSON>' lawyer. Ms. <PERSON> Schiebel </PERSON>, who testified that <PERSON> Hurt </PERSON> told her to shred his financial records after learning Ms. <PERSON> Jennings </PERSON> was suing him, said she gave the files to <PERSON> Golub </PERSON> in March, after Hurt married <PERSON> Heidi </PERSON> <PERSON> Henderson </PERSON>, daughter of bandleader <PERSON> Skitch </PERSON> <PERSON> Henderson </PERSON>. Ms. <PERSON> Schiebel </PERSON>, who also claimed that she developed emotional problems after going to work for Hurt, said she was under psychiatric treatment as a result. `` Are you claiming Mr. Hurt caused these -LRB- ailments -RRB-?'' asked Hurt lawyer <PERSON> Frances </PERSON> <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON>. `` Yes, I am,'' Ms. <PERSON> Schiebel </PERSON> replied. Ms. <PERSON> Silbermann </PERSON> said she will accept briefs with closing arguments from the lawyers in the near future and render a decision soon after that.

 A <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> intelligence analyst who defected to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> in 1986 complaining of <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> harassment actually was a long-time <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> spy, a newspaper said Tuesday in disclosing his death at the age of 32. The disclosure that <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Souther </PERSON> had been `` a staff member of the <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION>'' was a rare admission of Soviet spying. The military newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Star </ORGANIZATION> published an obituary signed by the <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION> collegium and his `` work comrades'' of the man it called <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Yevgenievich </PERSON> <PERSON> Orlov </PERSON>. It said he died suddenly June 22, but did not give a cause of death. A picture accompanying the obituary showed a clean-cut <PERSON> Souther </PERSON> wearing a suit and tie. It was not clear whether he was a Soviet mole working under cover for years in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, or whether he began working for the <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION> _ the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> secret police and intelligence unit _ only after his defection. `` I think it's probably too early to tell,'' <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Kortan </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. He said <PERSON> Souther </PERSON> was born in <LOCATION> Hammond </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ind. </LOCATION>, went to high school in <LOCATION> Cumberland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> believes he took the name <PERSON> Orlov </PERSON> when he defected, <PERSON> Kortan </PERSON> said. `` There's some attempt to imply that he was really a Soviet-born citizen and became a mole, but that was never really stated and I do n't believe it's true,'' said <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Kessler </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> author who is writing a book on <PERSON> Souther </PERSON>. `` He was an American mole.'' <PERSON> Kessler </PERSON> spoke in a telephone interview from his home in <LOCATION> Potomac </LOCATION>, Md. The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> says <PERSON> Souther </PERSON> was a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> veteran who disappeared in May 1986 after graduating from <ORGANIZATION> Old </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dominion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Norfolk </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, with a major in Russian. He served in the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> in the 1970s and worked as a civilian intelligence specialist in the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s 2nd Fleet headquarters in <LOCATION> Norfolk </LOCATION>. He apparently was being investigated for espionage at the time. Old Dominion professors said in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> that <PERSON> Souther </PERSON> was an outgoing, well-liked student who started out poorly in his Russian major. <PERSON> Leonid </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mihalap </PERSON>, a Soviet-born professor who taught <LOCATION> Souther </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Russian </LOCATION>, said he may have become disillusioned with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and committed suicide. <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Fahey </PERSON>, a professor's wife who knew <PERSON> Souther </PERSON> when he was a student, said: `` I think they decided that this was a bad apple. Probably somebody just said, ` Hey, let's get rid of him.''' <PERSON> Kortan </PERSON> said <PERSON> Souther </PERSON>'s wife did not defect with him. `` All that's come out is the fact that his wife has said she suspected him several years before he left,'' <PERSON> Kortan </PERSON> said, adding he did not know the status of their marriage. Soviet media reported in July 1988 that <PERSON> Souther </PERSON> had been granted asylum in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> after he claimed <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents persecuted him. The obitary said he was a `` Soviet intelligence agent'' who had worked a long time to `` remove the threat of nuclear war hanging over humanity,'' and had `` performed special assignments and made a large contribution to ensuring Soviet state security.'' The newspaper did not say exactly what he did for the <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION>, or how long he had spied for the Soviets. Shortly after his defection was disclosed, <PERSON> Souther </PERSON> appeared on Soviet TV to describe his American work with secret reconnaissance photographs taken by satellites to help plan the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bombing raid on <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> in April 1986. The attack was to retaliate for what <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> claimed was Libyan involvement in the bombing of a West German disco in which a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> serviceman was killed and 50 others wounded. In his TV appearance, <PERSON> Souther </PERSON> said nothing about spying for the Soviets. During the broadcast, <PERSON> Souther </PERSON> indicated he had not settled in to Soviet life and was n't satisfied with what he was doing. Although he said he had a comfortable <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> apartment, <PERSON> Souther </PERSON> added, `` There's a lot of work here, but I have n't found my niche exactly. I do n't feel that I'm being the most productive for what I have to offer.'' <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Star </ORGANIZATION> said he `` made a great contribution to maintaining the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s security.''

<HEAD>Senate Staff Report Challenges Shoreham Closure; Seabrook Sirens
OK'ed</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> committee staff analysis concluded Tuesday that running the controversial <LOCATION> Shoreham </LOCATION> nuclear power plant on <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> would be cheaper that shutting it down, contrary to an analysis by state regulators. After hearing some of the report's conclusions, Chairman <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Bradford </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> characterized the study, which he had not seen, as `` baloney.'' The analysis was released as the <ORGANIZATION> Nuclear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regulatory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Atomic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Licensing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> decided that it was acceptable to use pole-mounted sirens on trucks to notify nearby <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> residents of an emergency at the <LOCATION> Seabrook </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.H. </LOCATION>, nuclear power plant, the other completed but not operating reactor in the Northeast Though some of the truck sites would slightly exceed federal guidelines of that it should not take more than 15 minutes to set off warnings, the board said the plan by the <PERSON> Seabrook </PERSON> operators was adequate considering `` the fact that concerned political jurisdictions can reduce alerting and notification times by making sites available for sirens permanently mounted on poles.'' The state of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> and its towns in the evacuation zones have refused to cooperate in emergency planning, and <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Deputy Attorney General <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Jonas </PERSON> said the state would appeal the decision to an appeal board. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> report, an analysis of a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> commission study performed last year of the plant owned by <ORGANIZATION> Long </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Island </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lighting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> or <ORGANIZATION> LILCO </ORGANIZATION>, was prepared by an economist with the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Natural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION>, which is chaired by Sen. <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnston </PERSON>, D-La. `` His study concludes that the <ORGANIZATION> PSC </ORGANIZATION> report is a biased and unfair comparison of <LOCATION> Shoreham </LOCATION> In-Service and the Settlement,'' <PERSON> Johnston </PERSON> said in a letter to <LOCATION> Bradford </LOCATION>. `` The study shows that <LOCATION> Shoreham </LOCATION> operation would save three-quarters of a billion dollars in real economic costs over the first 15 years of its life.'' The settlement refers to the pending deal, to be voted on by <ORGANIZATION> LILCO </ORGANIZATION> shareholders Wednesday, to turn the $ 5.5 billion plant over to the state for $ 1 and assurance of a decade's worth of rate increases of about 5 percent a year. Though fully licensed, the plant has never entered commercial operation. Local and state authorities contend nearby residents could not be evacuated in an emergency. <PERSON> Bradford </PERSON> said <PERSON> Johnston </PERSON> assigned staff `` to go and find every fault that they could with the PSC-LILCO study.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> staff analysis concludes that <ORGANIZATION> LILCO </ORGANIZATION>'s electric rates with <LOCATION> Shoreham </LOCATION> in service would average about 15.22 cents per kilowatt-hour, 0.29 cents cheaper than under the shutdown. The state study estimated the average rate if Shoreham operates sat 14.96 cents or 0.52 cents more expensive than closing it down. The report criticized the <ORGANIZATION> PSC </ORGANIZATION> analysis for placing too much emphasis on electric rates in the first 11 years of <LOCATION> Shoreham </LOCATION> operation while `` utility investments are typically analyzed over planning horizons of 20-30 years.'' `` That's flat wrong,'' <PERSON> Bradford </PERSON> countered. `` The <ORGANIZATION> PSC </ORGANIZATION>'s study runs out to the year 2003, I believe, but a lot of the further calculations run out over the life of <LOCATION> Shoreham </LOCATION>.'' The committee staff study also said, among other things, that the state had overestimated the savings to the company of being able to carry more debt with <PERSON> Shoreham </PERSON> retired, had failed to assign enough cost to shrunken generating reserves without <LOCATION> Shoreham </LOCATION> and had assumed the implausibly low price for oil, <ORGANIZATION> LILCO </ORGANIZATION>'s major fuel, in the year 2000 of $ 15 per barrel vs. $ 20 to $ 25 a barrel forecasts by private consulting firms.

<HEAD>Coroner Says Former Raiders Star Overdosed on Darvon</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: UPDATES throughout with comments from coroner and parents, background.

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Former pro football star <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Matuszak </PERSON> died of an accidental overdose of a mild narcotic painkiller, the coroner said Tuesday in a report that also found non-lethal traces of cocaine in his system. Also contributing to the death of the former <ORGANIZATION> Oakland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Raider </ORGANIZATION> defensive lineman were an enlarged heart and pneumonia, <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> coroner's spokesman <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dambacher </PERSON> said. `` The manner of death is listed as an accident,'' <PERSON> Dambacher </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Matuszak </PERSON>'s parents immediately acknowledged his use of prescribed and illegal drugs for his chronic pain. `` At the proper time, we will have things to say about substance abuse and the scoundrels in the medical profession who recklessly dispense prescription drugs and the parasites of society who distribute illicit drugs from back alleys to fashionable condominiums,'' his parents, <PERSON> Marv </PERSON> and <PERSON> Audrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Matuszak </PERSON>, said in a statement released within minutes of the coroner's report. <PERSON> Matuszak </PERSON>, who was 38 when he died June 17 in a <LOCATION> Burbank </LOCATION> hospital, had been given a prescription for Darvocet early that morning, <PERSON> Dambacher </PERSON> said. Darvocet is a combination of two drugs: propoxyphene, a mild narcotic painkiller found in <LOCATION> Darvon </LOCATION>, and acetaminophen, the painkiller found in Tylenol, Anacin-3, Panadol and Tempra. High doses of propoxyphene `` taken for prolonged periods may lead to physical dependence on the drug. However, it is less addictive than other similar drugs, and most people are able to stop treatment without difficulty,'' according to the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Guide to Prescription And Over-The-Counter Drugs.'' The propoxyphene level found in <PERSON> Matuszak </PERSON>'s blood was 3.4 micrograms per milliliter, <PERSON> Dambacher </PERSON> said. `` Anything could be fatal over 1.0 -LRB- micrograms -RRB-, but that depends if you've perhaps been using it, you can build up a tolerance,'' <PERSON> Dambacher </PERSON> said. `` With his size -LRB- 6-foot-8, 280 pounds -RRB- and his prior use of it, we do n't know how much it takes. <PERSON> Dambacher </PERSON> said he did not know how much of the painkiller <PERSON> Matuszak </PERSON> took before his death. Tests also showed traces of a byproduct of cocaine, but that was not considered to have contributed to <PERSON> Matuszak </PERSON>'s death, <PERSON> Dambacher </PERSON> said. Side effects of Darvocet _ including dizziness, drowsiness and nausea _ are more common in active people, and often can be relieved by lying down and resting. `` Serious adverse effects are rare except in overdose,'' the <ORGANIZATION> AMA </ORGANIZATION> said. <PERSON> Matuszak </PERSON>'s parents alluded to their son's battle against chronic pain `` and his resulting use of drugs, both prescription and otherwise.'' `` For now, however, we do not wish the dark side of these realities to detract from the celebration of the good and great deeds of this kind and wonderful man _ our son.'' The Matuszaks' statement was released by a publicist. They were in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> for a memorial service and could not immediately be reached for additional comment. <PERSON> Matuszak </PERSON> played for the <ORGANIZATION> Raiders </ORGANIZATION> from 1976-81 and was on two Super Bowl championship teams. He was on the injured reserve list when the club moved to <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> in 1982. <PERSON> Matuszak </PERSON> retired that year to pursue an acting career fulltime.

 <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> announced Tuesday it is investigating doctors in several <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> cities who are testing an AIDS drug from <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> without federal approval. Nine doctors in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> have treated 42 patients with Compound Q, imported from <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> with the help of couriers who in some cases bribed <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> government officials, doctors said Monday. Three patients showed adverse reactions and one died Saturday. Compound Q is the name AIDS researchers have given to trichosanthin, a protein from the root of a cucumberlike plant that <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> doctors have used to induce abortions and to treat cancer since the third century. Dr. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Rothman </PERSON>, one of the doctors in the underground testing, said that observations of 15 patients in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> indicated the drug `` appears to be the most effective AIDS medication available or on the horizon.'' `` We would have liked to have done this study formally, and with the approval of the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION>,'' he said. `` But one person dies from AIDS every 30 minutes. We felt that as long as we proceeded on a rigorous scientific basis, we would be on very strong ground.'' The <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION>, under its so-called compassionate use decision, allows individuals to import `` personal use'' quantities of experimental drugs. The supplies must be no more than enough for one individual use for three months. Large-scale importation of unapproved products for commercial use is prohibited. Violating <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> policy on distributing unapproved drugs could result in seizure of the material; cease and desist orders; or, in rare cases, mostly involving for-profit schemes, criminal penalties. The agency said drug testing must be done under its scrutiny. `` We will be investigating this matter, to see just what has occurred,'' said <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Brad </PERSON> <PERSON> Stone </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> has approved only one drug, AZT, to treat AIDS, and side effects keep many patients from taking it. The <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> in April approved testing on AIDS patients of GLQ223, a highly purified form of trichosanthin developed at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Genelabs </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Redwood </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>. At the time, <ORGANIZATION> Genelabs </ORGANIZATION> warned that AIDS patients should not turn to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> to get the active ingredient because it might have toxic side effects Some AIDS activists charged that the university and <ORGANIZATION> Genelabs </ORGANIZATION> were taking that position to protect an agreement giving their financial backer, the Swiss pharmaceutical company <ORGANIZATION> Sandoz </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>, exclusive rights to market GLQ223. At least one doctor not involved in the underground testing said the extreme side effects of Compound Q could have contributed to the death Saturday of an AIDS patient at <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zion </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>. That was denied by <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Delaney </PERSON>, co-director of Project Inform, a <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> AIDS education group that organized the network of doctors in the underground testing. `` But I want to stress that this is not herbal tea,'' said <PERSON> Delaney </PERSON>. `` This is radical chemotherapy. Some of the patients have had a very rough ride.'' <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> immunologist, Dr. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Levin </PERSON>, who helped set up the study of Compound Q, said the program is at least six months ahead of mainline research on the drug's efficacy and contended he could have dosage recommendations within three months. `` From our tests, we'll have better scientific data in 10 percent of time and 1 percent of the cost it is taking regular science to do the job,'' said <PERSON> Levin </PERSON>. He and his wife, Dr. <PERSON> Vera </PERSON> <PERSON> Byers </PERSON>, designed the trial. `` Our scientific -LRB- procedures -RRB- are very good and rigorous,'' said <PERSON> Levin </PERSON>. `` I resent people calling us underground, illegal or guerilla groups. We're not amateurs. We're first-class doctors.'' <PERSON> Levin </PERSON> said lawyers for doctors involved in the program had informed <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> officials earlier this spring of the treatment trial.

<TEXT>
 The House on Tuesday rejected a five-year extension of most-favored-nation trading status for <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, with some members arguing the issue should be left to the president's discretion President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> already has announced he intends to extend the trade preference for another year. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> vote was 242-172 for the legislation, less than the two-thirds necessary to pass a bill under suspension of the rules, a procedure generally reserved for non-controversial bills. During debate, Rep. <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Gibbons </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Fla </LOCATION>., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Means </ORGANIZATION> trade subcommittee, said: `` The people of <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> have demonstrated since World War II that they seek and yearn for freedom They're close now. It is time for us to take them off of probation and extend a helping hand.'' Earlier, at a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> hearing, <PERSON> Curtis </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kamman </PERSON>, deputy assistant secretary of state for <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> affairs, said <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> had made progress in human rights, including free travel and emigration. <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, a communist nation in the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact, will clearly meet the criteria for a new extension of its most-favored-nation status, which presidents have renewed annually over the past decade, he said. In light of that, there is no need for <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to direct a five-year extension, he said. Countries in most-favored-nation status are guaranteed the lowest tariffs applicable to their products _ in other words, they will be treated like `` the most favored nation.'' Speaking against the measure on the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> floor, Rep. <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Gilman </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.Y. </LOCATION>, said the trade benefits should be left to the president to determine, and pointed to the recent Chinese crackdown on the pro-democracy movement as an example of how quickly situations can change. <PERSON> Gilman </PERSON> also hinted that President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> might want to make the announcement himself during a trip to <LOCATION> Budapest </LOCATION> in about two weeks. He asked colleagues not to `` pre-empt the president from taking the kinds of steps he would be inclined to do later on this year.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on May 31 announced his intention to extend <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s trade benefit for another year. The president also has generally held out the hope of increased economic aid to East Bloc countries that expand freedoms, and has promised a longer-term extension of most-favored-nation trading status to <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> if it passes a liberalized emigration law. Current law bars most-favored-nation status, with its preferential customs duty rates, to communist countries with restrictive emigration policies. Since the ban was imposed in 1974, three nations have been granted waivers: <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Committee Would Bar Referrals To Some Affiliated Labs</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Means </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> approved legislation Tuesday that would bar doctors from referring patients to testing labs they own, but do not supervise. The anti-referral package, pushed by Rep. <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Stark </PERSON>, D-Calif., is part of an overall Medicare bill the committee is expected to approve on Wednesday Even though the section on referrals technically could be changed before the overall bill wins final committee approval, committee staffers said it and several less controversial matters are considered final for all practical purposes. The panel left the most controversial part of the Medicare bill until Wednesday, the second of two days of closed hearings: whether to clamp a limit on the overall amount <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> will pay for doctor bills and whether to adopt a new fee schedule for Medicare-covered services. The health subcommittee headed by Stark proposed setting targets under which Medicare doctor bill spending could not grow more than somewhere between 10 percent and 12 percent next year. If actual 1990 billings exceeded that amount, fees would be held down to compensate. The anti-referral provisions are aimed at removing the financial incentive for doctors to enhance their income by referring patients to labs in which their sole interest is financial rather than professional.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> WASHINGTON </LOCATION> _ Energy Secretary <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> on Tuesday launched a broad shakeup of nuclear weapons production, pledging to `` chart a new course'' of environmental safeguards and conceding that a key waste storage facility has to be delayed. `` The chickens have finally come home to roost,'' <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> said, after `` years of inattention to changing standards and demands regarding the environment, safety and health.'' <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> announced new steps for improving management of the weapons production complex, including 17 major plants or laboratories in 12 states, and for determining the extent to which the facilities are violating state and federal environmental laws. He also said a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> site that was scheduled to open in September as the nation's first permanent dump for waste from the military facilities would not begin receiving waste until sometime in 1990. He said he had no more specific target date. `` We have had a flawed plan'' for opening the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant, he said. Waste production has been reduced, which should allow the production plants to continue operating normally until the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> site opens, he said. <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> announcement came as a group of 21 environmental, scientific and church groups sued the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> to try to force a broad public review of plans for modernizing the weapons plants. The suit filed in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> said the department should be compelled to prepare a Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement, a comprehensive analysis of the environmental and health effects of its weapons plant initiatives. <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> declined to comment directly on the suit except to say he was committed to ensuring full compliance with all environmental requirements. At his first formal news conference since taking office last March, <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> said he was surprised and disappointed to learn of the depth of problems in the weapons program, which has been crippled by mechanical failures and safety problems. `` It has been a nightmare for me to unravel the background sufficient to make a decision,'' he said, adding that he was being forced to act `` on a crisis basis'' because of the urgent need to get key weapons plants running again. Three nuclear reactors at the <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Site </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, which are the nation's only source of tritium needed for nuclear warheads, have been shut down for more than a year because of uncertainties about their safety. <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> said he hoped to announce a reactor restart scheduled in July. In what he called an illustration of the breadth of change he seeks in the weapons program, <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> restart plan would require <ORGANIZATION> Westinghouse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which runs the plant under a federal contract, to devote `` far more resources than our own program coordinator ever demanded'' in the past. He said he was creating environmental `` tiger teams'' to closely examine each weapons plant to assess its compliance with state and federal environmental laws. `` This is a complete review, with my tiger teams moving out to see to what degree we have actually been complying with the intent as well as the letter of the law,'' <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> said. The department's increased attention to health and safety issues comes just days after the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> raided the <ORGANIZATION> Rocky </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Flats </ORGANIZATION> weapons plant in <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> in search of evidence of illegal dumping and incineration of hazardous wastes. <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> was mildly critical of Justice for refusing to give him any information about its findings at Rocky Flats, which makes plutonium triggers for thermonuclear weapons. He said he wanted to find `` a new way of doing business in these events in the future, if we get into this situation, because I think it's important that we know at once whether there has been any violation of the environment, particularly when radioactivity is involved.'' <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> said Rocky Flats illustrated the extent of turmoil in the weapons program. `` I can not certify to you today, or to the public, that we know exactly'' what is contained in radioactive waste stored at Rocky Flats, he said. It will take another four months to `` revalidate'' the contents of the waste, he added. <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> also defended President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s decision to nominate <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Stello </PERSON> as assistant secretary for defense programs, the top job in the weapons program, despite what <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> called `` the potential controversiality'' of the choice. In 1987 a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> panel conducted a hearing on whether <PERSON> Stello </PERSON>, as executive director for operations of the <ORGANIZATION> Nuclear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regulatory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, was guilty of improprieties in connection with a commission investigation of the <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Authority </LOCATION>. The probe included the question of whether <PERSON> Stello </PERSON> improperly advised the manager of nuclear power at <ORGANIZATION> TVA </ORGANIZATION> on how to respond to a commission inquiry about the readiness of a plant under construction. Stello denied any improprieties. `` If he has some chinks in his armor, so be it,'' <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> said. `` I have to have somebody in here who wants to serve _ and let me tell you, not many want in on this one _ and has the skills and background to understand from Day One what it means to run a reactor.''

 A <LOCATION> Koreatown </LOCATION> apartment exploded in flames Tuesday as police investigated a stash of fireworks, injuring 10 police officers.

 A <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carolina </ORGANIZATION> foundation filed an appeal with the state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday in an effort to keep its records from being opened to the public. Circuit Judge <PERSON> Carol </PERSON> <PERSON> Connor </PERSON> on Monday ordered the <ORGANIZATION> Carolina </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> to open its records as a result of a 1987 lawsuit filed by The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> and The Greenville News. The news organizations requested access to the records under the state's Freedom of Information Act, which requires, with some exceptions, that public bodies open their records and meetings to the public. The foundation was established as a non-profit corporation to engage in land acquisition and development for the university. In their lawsuit, the news organizations said the foundation had received and spent more than $ 28 million in public funds. Foundation attorneys argued that the foundation is a private entity separate from the university and thus is unaffected by the law's disclosure provisions. But Ms. <PERSON> Connor </PERSON> agreed with the <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> and The News, ruling June 13 that the foundation was subject to the Freedom of Information Act. On Monday, Ms. <PERSON> Connor </PERSON> acted on the written order that she had instructed the news organizations' attorneys to prepare in the earlier ruling. Attorneys for the foundation filed a motion in circuit court Tuesday requesting a stay of the order so that the foundation's records could not be opened while the appeal was being considered The judge said the ruling did not necessarily apply to all foundations related to state schools or to businesses that receive public money.

 <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> tried to get involved in cocaine deals arranged by his associates so he could pocket tax-free cash, and once offered to store cocaine in his house, a former associate told baseball investigators. The allegation was dismissed as `` ridiculous'' by one of <PERSON> Rose </PERSON>'s lawyers <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Janszen </PERSON>, who claims he ran bets for the <ORGANIZATION> Cincinnati </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reds </ORGANIZATION> manager, told baseball investigators in February that <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> once asked him to set up a cocaine ring and include him. <PERSON> Janszen </PERSON> also said <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> once said he might consider throwing a game if he had a large bet on it. He also told investigators that <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> checked by telephone with other major-league managers about their players' physical status before placing bets on their teams. <PERSON> Janszen </PERSON>'s claims were made in an interview included in thousands of pages of exhibits to investigator <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dowd </PERSON>'s report, which was released Monday. It was the first time <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> has been linked to the cocaine ring operated by former associates who ran a gymnasium in <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION> where the manager worked out. `` This idea of <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> being involved with drugs is so far off the wall that it's ridiculous,'' <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> lawyer <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pitcairn </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> said. `` -LRB- To -RRB- anyone who knows <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> and has known <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> over the years, there's just no question he would n't get involved with drugs. `` For <PERSON> Janszen </PERSON> to say this is slander of the worst kind. It's further evidence to us that this guy will do anything to follow through with his blackmail attempts of <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> Why <PERSON> Dowd </PERSON>'s investigators even went into areas like this is beyond me. According to a spokeswoman for <PERSON> Dowd </PERSON>, the investigator said he left the drug references out of his 225-page summary report to baseball Commissioner <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bartlett </PERSON> <PERSON> Giamatti </PERSON> because it was not relevant to the gambling inquiry. In other developments, the former girlfriend of a Rose associate said she had corroborated the <PERSON> Dowd </PERSON> report's charge that <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> conspired to hide racetrack winnings from a $ 47,646 Pik-Six ticket in 1987 at <LOCATION> Turfway </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Florence </LOCATION>, Ky. If the charges are true, <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> faces possible indictment on charges of conspiracy to defraud the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government. A federal grand jury is investigating <PERSON> Rose </PERSON>'s income taxes. <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> <PERSON> Fernbach </PERSON> <PERSON> Billiter </PERSON>, the former girlfriend of <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gioiosa </PERSON>, told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> that she had provided first - and second-hand information supporting the charges to the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> Also, a Jan. 20 letter from <PERSON> Janszen </PERSON> to another attorney for Rose, <PERSON> Reuven </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Katz </PERSON>, reveals <PERSON> Janszen </PERSON>'s feelings on why his relationship with <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> deteriorated. `` Because I covered for him with his wife, while he was sleeping his way around town, she no longer wanted me in their house,'' <PERSON> Janszen </PERSON> said of <PERSON> Rose </PERSON>'s wife. `` <PERSON> Carol </PERSON> does n't have the guts to leave him, so she has to blame his friends for his disgusting behavior.'' Attempts to reach Mrs. <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> by telephone Tuesday were unsuccessful. <PERSON> Rose </PERSON>, who faces a possible lifetime ban by baseball if it is determined he bet on his own team, won a temporary restraining order preventing <PERSON> Giamatti </PERSON> from holding a hearing on the charges. Baseball's lawyers have asked a three-judge panel of an <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> appeals court to suspend the restraining order and <PERSON> Rose </PERSON>'s response is due Wednesday. <PERSON> Janszen </PERSON>, who recently completed a four-month sentence for failure to report income, did n't say that <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> used drugs, but he said the manager thought he could get cash from drug deals conducted by a circle of associates. Several of the associates were sentenced after federal authorities cracked a ring that smuggled cocaine from <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Gioiosa </PERSON> faces trial in <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION> next month on charges of tax evasion and conspiring to arrange cocaine deliveries from <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION> between 1985 and 1987. Gold's Gym, where <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> worked out, was operated by <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stenger </PERSON>, who admitted smuggling 40 to 50 kilograms of cocaine from <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Stenger </PERSON> was given an 10-year prison sentence last March following a guilty plea. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Fry </PERSON>, who owned the gym, is serving an eight-year term for cocaine trafficking and tax evasion. During his interview last February with baseball investigators, <PERSON> Janszen </PERSON> said that <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> showed him a copy of his income tax return in 1987. `` He showed me that and he told me at the same time, ` <PERSON> Paul </PERSON>, if you get me involved and if you can, if you will set up a cocaine organization and include me in it, you can spend as much money as you ever want to because if they ever come to you and say where do you get your money, I will tell them from <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Rose </PERSON>,''' <PERSON> Janszen </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Janszen </PERSON> also said <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> told him that <PERSON> Gioiosa </PERSON>, a former housemate of the manager, brought a suitcase with $ 200,000 into the <ORGANIZATION> Reds </ORGANIZATION>' clubhouse sometime during 1987 and showed <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> the money, which supposedly was going to be used to buy cocaine in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> <PERSON> Janszen </PERSON> said that when he asked <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> why he wanted to get involved in cocaine, <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> responded that he had a certificate of deposit for $ 65,000 or $ 75,000 that was maturing in a few weeks. He quoted <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> as saying: `` I'll use that money and buy the kilos and I'll keep them in my house because nobody would have the -- -- - to come to my house.''

His first book, `` Language, Truth and Logic,'' in 1936 was the first exposition of logical positivism in the English language. The movement, which <PERSON> Ayer </PERSON> helped to develop in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, expounds the view that philosophical problems of the past can be reduced to linguistic analysis, and that any idea that can not in principle be verified by sensory observation is nonsensical. Ranging widely between the ideas of linguistic philosophers <PERSON> Bertrand </PERSON> <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ludwig </PERSON> <PERSON> Wittgenstein </PERSON>, it accepts that language must be strictly analyzed and redefined if there is any possibility of using it as an intelligible means of logical argument. The philosophical school of linguistic analysts now dominates many British and American universities. `` Language, Truth and Logic,'' which jolted the metaphysicians by its assault on `` much of what has passed for philosophy,'' owed a debt to empiricists such as <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> and <PERSON> Rudolph </PERSON> <PERSON> Carnap </PERSON>. It brought the term `` logical positivist'' to the attention of British academics. `` I maintain that there is nothing in the nature of philosophy to warrant the existence of conflicting philosophical ` schools,''' he wrote. `` And I attempt to substantiate this by providing a definitive solution of the problems which have been the chief sources of controversy between philosophers in the past.'' `` The principles of logic and metaphysics are true simply because we never allow them to be anything else,'' he added. <PERSON> Ayer </PERSON> wrote `` The Foundations of Empirical Knowledge'' in 1940 and `` The Problem of Knowledge'' in 1956, as well as volumes of philosophical essays and histories of modern philosophy in which he extended the traditions of British empiricism. Born Oct. 29, 1910, <PERSON> Ayer </PERSON> was the only child of a French-Swiss father and a Dutch-Jewish mother. His father, <PERSON> Jules </PERSON>, a timber merchant, became a naturalized British subject before the birth of his son. Educated at <LOCATION> Eton </LOCATION> and at <ORGANIZATION> Oxford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, he was a philosophy lecturer and research student at <ORGANIZATION> Christ </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Oxford </LOCATION>, from 1932 to 1944, and dean of <ORGANIZATION> Wadham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Oxford </LOCATION> in 1945-1946. He served as an intelligence officer in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> during World War II. <PERSON> Ayer </PERSON> was professor of mind and logic at <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> London </ORGANIZATION> from 1946 to 1959, then professor of logic at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oxford </ORGANIZATION> and fellow of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Oxford </LOCATION>, until 1978. He was a visiting professor at <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in 1948-1949, at <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, in 1961-1962, and at <ORGANIZATION> Bard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> State </LOCATION>, from 1987. <PERSON> Ayer </PERSON> earned a first-class literary humanities degree at <ORGANIZATION> Oxford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in 1932, then spent several months in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> where he came under the lasting influence of the <PERSON> Werner </PERSON> <PERSON> Kreis </PERSON>, a school of Austrian philosophers dominated by <PERSON> Wittgenstein </PERSON> and <PERSON> Carnap </PERSON>. In the 1930s, he introduced and popularized at <ORGANIZATION> Oxford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> severe Viennese philosophical attitudes when <LOCATION> Oxford </LOCATION> philosophy was considered vague and explanatory rather than opinionated. <PERSON> Ayer </PERSON> married <PERSON> Grace </PERSON> <PERSON> Lees </PERSON> in 1932, and they had two children. His second marriage, to <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> journalist <PERSON> Dee </PERSON> <PERSON> Wells </PERSON>, ended in divorce 23 years later in 1983. He then married <PERSON> Vanessa </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawson </PERSON>, former wife of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s chancellor of the exchequer, <PERSON> Nigel </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawson </PERSON>.

 <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s national airline made its first direct flight to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> on Tuesday and brought 61 survivors of the Armenian earthquake to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> for six weeks of treatment. The 49 amputees and 12 victims suffering from multiple fractures, known as the `` crush syndrome,'' came slowly down the ramp. Those able to walk supported themselves with crutches as they limped off, taking their first look at the Jewish state that gathered them in for six weeks of medical treatment. The El Al <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 757 took off for <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION>, the capital of the Soviet Armenian republic, at 1:30 p.m. and returned to <LOCATION> Ben </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gurion </LOCATION> airport from its historic flight nine hours later. Israeli officials and Archbishop <PERSON> Kerkin </PERSON> <PERSON> Kazanjian </PERSON>, head of the Armenian Church in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, greeted the survivors. <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> immigrants from <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> brought flowers. Health Minister <PERSON> Yaakov </PERSON> <PERSON> Tzur </PERSON> told reporters at the airport, `` This definitely shows we are experiencing a new relationship with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>.'' <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> cut diplomatic relations with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> after the 1967 <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> war in a show of solidarity with <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> nations. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> exchanged low-level consular delegations in 1987. The Armenian patients looked confused and smiled uneasily upon their arrival. During the 2 -LCB- - hour flight from <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>, many burst into tears recalling the ordeal of the Dec. 7 earthquake that left an estimated 25,000 dead, many thousands injured and 500,000 homeless `` I lost 18 classmates in the earthquake,'' said 17-year-old <PERSON> Egor </PERSON> <PERSON> Khatchaturian </PERSON> of hard-hit <LOCATION> Spitak </LOCATION>. `` They told me a week ago that I was going to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. I feel very well. I hope they will make a prosthesis for me,'' he said. <PERSON> Khatchaturian </PERSON>, who lost his left leg, could not recall what he did after the quake and wept the moment the disaster was mentioned. The youth was traveling alone, his parents back in <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>. Clutching his crutches, he sat silently in an armchair, dressed in blue sports jacket and blue hat. An Armenian team of two doctors and four nurses accompanied the victims. They will be trained in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to provide the pateints with follow-up treatment. In <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION>, Armenian officials held a reception for the Israeli group and laid out cheese, meat, vodka and Armenian cognac. On the main table, an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> flag stood beside the red-and-blue Armenian flag. The restaurant band played <PERSON> Hava </PERSON> <PERSON> Nagila </PERSON>, the popular Israeli tune, as officials of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jewish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Distribution </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> performed a lively dance. `` I hope the time will come when planeloads like yours will land in <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION> without any disaster having prompted their visit,'' said <PERSON> Narine </PERSON> <PERSON> Balayan </PERSON>, the Armenian minister of social affairs who acted as host. The mood grew quieter as survivors emerged one by one from the main building and were carried onto the plane. A bearded Armenian approached and made the sign of cross on their foreheads. `` Go with God,'' somebody muttered. The New-York based <ORGANIZATION> JDC </ORGANIZATION>, a Jewish relief group, sponsored the mission after collecting about $ 500,000 in donations. The money will be used to build a rehabilitation clinic in <LOCATION> Leninacan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>, and to bring victims for treatment in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. Transport Minister <PERSON> Moshe </PERSON> <PERSON> Katzav </PERSON> saw off the flight to <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION> and described it as a new stage in the thawing relations between the two countries. <PERSON> Katzav </PERSON> said, `` It is primarily a humanitarian operation, but <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> is interested and is looking forward to a resumption of diplomatic relations with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>.'' The plane also carried to <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> 10 tons of medicine and medical equipment accidently shipped to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> by a Dutch relief agency, a <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> municipal spokeswoman said. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> sent military medics to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> during the last year to help victims of the Armenian earthquake and of a rail disaster in the <LOCATION> Ural </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountains </LOCATION>.

 The House on Tuesday approved plans to require the government to collect and publish for five years statistics on crimes based on the race, ethic group, sexual preference or religion of the victims. `` This legislation is an opportunity to begin the counterattack against crimes based on hate,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Schumer </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, as the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> approved the measure 368-47 and sent it to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. Supporters said the nation is being hit by a growing wave of so-called hate crimes, ranging from gang attacks on members of minority groups to cross burnings and the spray painting of swastikas and bigoted slogans. Under the bill, statistics would be collected on homicide, assault, robbery, burglary, theft, arson, vandalism, trespassing, threats and others deemed appropriate by the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> if they involved bias involving race, ethnicity, sexual preference or religion. The House has passed similar measures in the past but the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> has not acted. A hate crimes bill was approved by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> on March 9 and supporters are hoping for a floor vote. The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> publishes annual crime statistics but does not include hate crimes. Supporters have relied on unofficial reports and anecdotal information from news accounts in estimating that the problem is growing worse. Rep. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Green </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.Y. </LOCATION>, said 1,281 anti-semitic incidents were reported by the Anti-Defamation League of B'Nai B'rith in 1988. He said the National Gay and <ORGANIZATION> Lesbian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Task </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> reported 7,008 incidents of anti-gay violence in 1987. `` There is also evidence of growing Klan, neo-Nazi, skinhead and other hate group activity throughout the nation,'' <PERSON> Green </PERSON> said. `` The tremendous rise in crimes against minorities is widespread and extremely serious,'' Rep. <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Pelosi </PERSON>, D-Calif., said Compiling data on such acts would help in fighting them, supporters said `` The more we know about crimes of hate the more chance we have of preventing them,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennelly </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Conn </LOCATION>. `` <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> should send a clear signal to all people that crimes based on race, religion or sexuality will not be tolerated,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Gilman </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N </LOCATION>

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, declaring the American flag a `` unique national symbol,'' Tuesday called for a constitutional amendment to set aside last week's <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> decision and forbid flag desecration. `` As president, I will uphold our precious right to dissent, but burning the flag goes too far, and I want to see that matter remedied,'' he said at a news conference. His announcement came as efforts already were advancing in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to condemn last week's decision extending First Amendment free speech rights to protesters who burn the flag. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> voted 411-5 Tuesday night for a resolution that expressed `` profound concern'' over the court decision and called for `` continued commitment to preserving the honor and integrity of the flag as a living symbol of our nation.'' The resolution, whose chief sponsor was <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Brooks </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, also `` condemns all actions intended to desecrate the American flag'' and urged Americans to display the flag. <PERSON> Brooks </PERSON> said the committee would begin hearings soon to `` examine the matter from the standpoint of the need for constitutional amendment or statutory remedies.'' House members used the resolution to vent their feelings. Rep. <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON> <PERSON> Hubbard </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, D-Ky., said those who burn the flag should `` consider moving to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>, where burning the flag ... is encouraged. But Rep. <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Weiss </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, deploring desecration of the flag, said the court acted correctly: `` I exult in the decision ... because the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> has has validated once again the Constitution and the Bill of Rights.'' `` We should be careful of a reckless tampering with the Constitution,'' he said. Voting against the resolution were Reps. <PERSON> Weiss </PERSON>; <PERSON> Gus </PERSON> <PERSON> Savage </PERSON>, D-Ill.; <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Dellums </PERSON>, D-Calif.; <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Clay </PERSON>, D-Mo., and <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Crockett </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Mich </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who made patriotism, the flag and the pledge of allegiance a central theme in his 1988 presidential campaign, asserted, `` I think respect for the flag transcends political party and I think what I've said It is n't Republican or Democrat, it is n't liberal or conservative.'' He said adding an amendment to the Constitution would be the only foolproof way to set aside the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruling, which nullified flag-desecration laws in 48 states. However, the process is a lengthy one _ requiring two-thirds votes in both <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and then ratification by no less than 38 state legislatures. In the Constitution's 200-year history, thousands of amendments have been proposed but only 26 have been ratified. Still, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` the importance of this issue compels me to call for a constitutional amendment.'' `` Support for the First Amendment need not extend to desecration of the American flag,'' he added. `` Protection of the flag _ a unique national symbol _ will in no way limit the opportunity nor the breadth of protest available in the exercise of free speech rights.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s comments were praised by conservatives but denounced by civil-liberties groups. `` We think it violates the fundamental principle of this nation that every person has a right to express their views and express them in a way they choose, no matter how obnoxious the majority find those views,'' said <PERSON> Morton </PERSON> <PERSON> Halperin </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> director of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Cole </PERSON>, staff attorney for the <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Constitutional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION>, said: `` The First Amendment has survived for 200 years without exceptions. It is outrageous for the president to urge that we deviate from the fundamental principles of toleration and freedom of expression.'' Last week, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> by voice vote added language to child-care legislation that would make desecration of the flag punishable by a maximum $ 1,000 fine and a year in prison. However, this language would not be added to the Constitution and therefore could be overturned by the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. Senators also voted 97-3 for a resolution expressing `` profound disappointment'' in the court ruling and pledging to `` seek ways to restore sanctions against such reprehensible conduct.'' A number of proposed constitutional amendments on the subject have been introduced in both houses. No hearings have yet been scheduled. House Republican Leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> said he supported <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s call even though he harbored an `` instinctive conservative's dislike'' of ameding the Constitution. The court decision `` leaves me with no alternative,'' <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> said. `` Unfurl the flag, fly it, flaunt it, argue about it if you want to, but do n't desecrate it _ that's all we're asking. Surely that view reflects the common sense of the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people,'' <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> said. Sen. <PERSON> Strom </PERSON> <PERSON> Thurmond </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-S.C. </LOCATION>, one of numerous lawmakers to propose constitutional amendments to overturn the decision, said, `` With the president's backing I intend to move forward expeditiously. This egregious decision by the court must be corrected.'' House Speaker <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>, D-Wash., who has criticized the court decision while voicing objections to amending the Constitution to overturn it, reacted angrily to suggestions that Republicans could make flag burning a partisan issue if Democrats fail to support a constitutional amendment `` I'm sure people will play politics with any emotional issue,'' <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> said. But he added that anyone who does so with the flag issue would be `` playing the most cynical politics ... for the most base and crass political purposes.'' In his 1988 campaign, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> frequently blasted Democratic opponent Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> for vetoing a <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> law requiring public school teachers to lead their classes in the pledge of allegiance. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said during the campaign that, if he had been governor, he would have found ways to make the law stick. He reinforced his theme by visiting a flag factory. On Tuesday, asked if he had n't used the flag for partisan purposes during that campaign, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> responded: `` Everything I did last year was for the purpose of advancing my _ everything I did politically _ advancing my election. But I did n't put it on the basis that Republicans are for the flag and Democrats are not.'' On another court-related topic, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was asked about recent <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> rulings on affirmative action that have drawn criticism from civil rights groups _ rulings making it harder for employees to bring discrimination cases against employers. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he had been assured by Attorney General <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> that follow-up legislation was unnecessary.

 Mayor <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Camacho </PERSON> <PERSON> Solis </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> Citry ordered the police intelligence unit disbanded Tuesday after three commanders were charged in a murder plot that led to the death of an investigative journalist. In a statement, he branded as intolerable their purported involvement in the May 30, 1984, death of columnist <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Buendia </PERSON>. He said the order to disband the <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Division </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mexico </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> because of the <PERSON> Buendia </PERSON> case and `` other crimes'' was effective at once.

All three said they were tortured into confessing. Authorities say the men acted on orders of <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Zorrilla </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON>, then head of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>. All three served as officers under <PERSON> Zorrilla </PERSON> in the agency, which was the Mexican equivalent of the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> but was disbanded for corruption in 1985. <PERSON> Zorrilla </PERSON>, 47, is under indictment as having masterminded <PERSON> Buendia </PERSON>'s murder. He faces other charges, including obstructing justice and abuse of authority. Authorities say <PERSON> Zorrilla </PERSON> feared that <PERSON> Buendia </PERSON> would expose his lucrative links with Mexican narcotics kingpins. <PERSON> Zorrilla </PERSON> denies ordering <PERSON> Buendia </PERSON>'s death. The intelligence police have been under fire by human rights activists, public officials and the press since the unit was created late last year as part of President <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Gortari </PERSON>'s crime-fighting program The first commander, <PERSON> Miguel </PERSON> <PERSON> Nazar </PERSON> <PERSON> Haro </PERSON>, is wanted in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> on a 1982 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> indictment alleging he was part of an auto theft and auto smuggling ring. The unit also was assailed for its role in quelling a prison riot in <LOCATION> Tepic </LOCATION>, 500 miles from <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. A videotape viewed by The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> indicated that six prisoners who surrendered were later shot. Repeated demands were made in the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>, the capital's equivalent of a city council, for disbanding the unit, which was accused of illegal detentions, torture and extortion. In March, intelligence agents were accused of detaining nine women coming home from an illegal abortion clinic. The women said they were beaten and their elderly doctor was tortured before they were released without charge 14 hours later. Police and city officials refused to discuss the incident but they closed down the intelligence police's notorious detention center, Tlaxcoaque, in April.

 A booby trap bomb killed a police reservist in a country hamlet late Tuesday, hours after an incendiary bomb exploded in a paint store in <LOCATION> Londonderry </LOCATION>, injuring 13 people. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Black </PERSON>, 34, a full-time reserve constable, died when a bomb exploded under his car outside his home in <LOCATION> Ballymagorry </LOCATION>, 12 miles south of <LOCATION> Londonderry </LOCATION>, said <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION> press officer Sgt. <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Breakey </PERSON>. Black, married with an 18-month-old daughter, was on his way to visit his recently widowed mother, <PERSON> Breakey </PERSON> said. No group claimed responsibility for the attack, but suspicion fell on the <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, which has targeted security forces in its campaign to drive the British from <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Black </PERSON> joined the <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ulster </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Constabulary </ORGANIZATION>'s reserve unit 10 years ago, <PERSON> Breakey </PERSON> said. The 4,600-member force, which includes many part-time officers, supplements the province's 8,200-member main police force. Earlier Tuesday, the outlawed <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> claimed responsibility for planting a device at a paint shop in <LOCATION> Londonderry </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. TV reported Police said they checked the shop and found nothing, but after they left, an incendiary device detonated and set the shop afire. Ten adults and three children were treated for burns and shock at <LOCATION> Altnagelvin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>, police said. An 8-year-old boy and three women, including the boy's mother, were admitted. Witnesses said paint cans burst in the heat of the fire. Police said two men claiming to speak for the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> made an anonymous telephone call Tuesday warning of bombs in the paint shop and four other sites. No bombs were found at the offices of <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telecom </ORGANIZATION> and other locations mentioned, police said. Police removed a bomb from a hijacked city bus parked at the railway station, but another bomb on a bus left on a bridge exploded Tuesday night. No one was injured, police said. Earlier Tuesday, <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON>, the top British official in the province, visited <LOCATION> Londonderry </LOCATION> to announce that <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telecom </ORGANIZATION> would be hiring 80 people to staff a new directory inquiries center in the city. `` The Provisionals -LRB- IRA -RRB- responded in the only way they know, to bomb, to disfigure and to maim,'' <PERSON> King </PERSON> said after the paint store explosion. <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Cameron </PERSON>, 22, died in a <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION> hospital Tuesday 10 days after he was beaten with a hatchet. Police said <PERSON> Cameron </PERSON> had been sleeping beside a pile of wood in a <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> district of the city.

 Death penalty opponents are calling for new state laws to protect juveniles and the mentally retarded in the wake of <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> rulings they say are `` medieval and barbaric.'' `` To give up, with ultimate finality, upon a person even before they emerge from childhood ... is squarely in opposition to the fundamental premises of an enlightened juvenile justice system,'' said <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Raven </PERSON>. Of the 37 states permitting capital punishment, 15 now bar its use for anyone who committed the crime before age 18. The court, voting 5-4, said Monday the Constitution does not bar states from executing murderers who committed their crimes as young as 16 or mentally retarded adult killers. In the case of the mentally retarded, the justices said convicted murderers may demand that sentencing juries and judges consider their limited reasoning capacity as a factor weighing against the death penalty.

 A survey of more than 3,000 adults suggests that if there was a sexual revolution in the 1960s, most Americans missed it. The survey, conducted in 1970 but published this week for the first time, found that Americans overwhelmingly disapproved of prostitution, extramarital sex and premarital sex and were fiercely opposed to homosexuality. `` The number of women jumping in and out of bed at random is exaggerated, I think, just as the number of homosexuals in the population has been exaggerated,'' one of the study's authors, <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Levitt </PERSON>, a psychologist at the <ORGANIZATION> Indiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medicine </ORGANIZATION>, said in a telephone interview Monday.

 Volume control and the absence of mosquitoes, ants and rain are some of the advantages of spending the Fourth of July in front of the tube. A few of the guests on holiday television specials are also unlikely to show up at the family picnic, not to mention some spectacular fireworks displays. But regardless how spectacular is TV's version of July Fourth, it is traditionally the lowest viewing period of the year. Most Americans prefer to celebrate Independence Day with the real thing, even if it means listening to Uncle <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> instead of <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Mancini </PERSON> or waving a sparkler in the back yard rather than watching the rockets' red glare over the Jefferson Memorial. But for those stuck indoors, or who choose to be inside, television is doing its part. <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> gets an early start on the festivities with a pre-Independence Day special Monday, `` Freedom Festival'89.'' <ORGANIZATION> Buena </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Vista </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> is syndicating a live Fourth of July special from <ORGANIZATION> Walt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION>. But the patriotic place to be is the nation's capital, and <ORGANIZATION> PBS </ORGANIZATION> takes viewers there with its traditional `` Capitol Fourth'' concert <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Duffy </PERSON> of `` <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>'' is host of the one-hour <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> special, which was taped outside <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>'s Independence Hall. The show is a string of tributes: to the music of the street by <LOCATION> Philly </LOCATION> native <PERSON> Frankie </PERSON> <PERSON> Avalon </PERSON>, to <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s musical heritage by the <ORGANIZATION> Oak </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ridge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boys </ORGANIZATION>, to the nation's ethnic diversity by <PERSON> Nell </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> and the <ORGANIZATION> Philadelphia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mummers </ORGANIZATION>, and to freedom by Take 6, the a capella singing group. Public television stations will offer `` A Capitol Fourth 1989'' on Tuesday night, a traditional live concert from the grounds of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Capitol where thousands gather with picnics to enjoy the music and the fireworks. E.G. <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> is host this year of the 90-minute broadcast. Musical guests include <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Galway </PERSON>, <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Mancini </PERSON>, <PERSON> Pearl </PERSON> <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON> and <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Nero </PERSON>. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Conlon </PERSON> conducts the National Symphony Orchestra. The 1989 `` Capitol Fourth'' is the 10th in the concert series.

Pianist <PERSON> Nero </PERSON> plans to play <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Gershwin </PERSON>'s `` Rhapsody in Blue.'' <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON> will sing `` Battle Hymn of the Republic'' and `` God Bless America.'' <PERSON> Conlon </PERSON>, currently music director of the <ORGANIZATION> Rotterdam </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Philharmonic </ORGANIZATION>, will lead the <ORGANIZATION> NSO </ORGANIZATION> in the traditional rousing medley of <PERSON> Sousa </PERSON> marches for the finale _ the fireworks display over the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> Monument. <PERSON> Buena </PERSON> <PERSON> Vista </PERSON>'s `` Walt Disney World 4th of July Spectacular'' is also live Tuesday night and has been syndicated in 95 percent of the nation's television markets.

<HEAD>First Women Complete State Shock Camp Prison Program</HEAD>

 <PERSON> Felicita </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> is ready to start her life over. `` I have a future in front of me,'' said the 24-year-old resident of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>'s lower East Side. `` A better future.'' That future includes a high school equivalency degree, a job and the chance to raise her two young children properly. <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> said it wo n't include using or selling drugs, which is what got her into trouble in the first place. It also got her into state prison. `` This inmate thinks she can do it,'' she said. `` I know I'm special now. <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> and 14 other women this month became the first female platoon to complete <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> state's shock incarceration program. About 1,400 of the state's 40,000 prison inmates are women. While doing their six months at the shock camp, the women followed an intense regime of military drills, manual labor, exercise, remedial education and drug and alcohol counseling. They lost weight, gained some self-respect _ and won their freedom earlier than they would have in a traditional prison. They opted into the program, trading a tough six months in an environment very much like a <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> boot camp for a shorter prison term. First-time, non-violent offenders sentenced to three years or less in prison who complete the shock program are immediately eligible for parole. That means they can cut up to 2 -LCB- years off their minimum prison time. That's good news for the state, whose prisons are so overcrowded that officials recently decided to start housing inmates in prison gymnasiums. And it's very good news for inmates who want to go home early. `` I'm going home and growing my hair,'' said <PERSON> Christine </PERSON> <PERSON> Conti </PERSON>, a cocaine dealer, as she stuffed her possessions in a paper bag and prepared for a ride home to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>. The women in shock camp do n't have to shave their heads as closely as the male inmates, but their hair is cut to about collar length. <PERSON> Conti </PERSON>, 25, said most of the other shock inmates `` thought I was crazy'' because she liked the running and the strenuous exercise that begins every day at 5:30 a.m. But other aspects of the military life did n't sit as well. `` The worst part is the mess hall,'' she said. `` I like to talk when I eat ... You ca n't talk. You ca n't even look.'' <PERSON> Sherrell </PERSON> <PERSON> Radcliffe </PERSON>, 26, of <LOCATION> Rochester </LOCATION>, could n't wait to get out of the fatigues she'd been wearing for six months. `` I keep looking at what everyone else is wearing,'' she said of inmates' friends and relatives at graduation. Superintendent <PERSON> Rosetta </PERSON> <PERSON> Burke </PERSON> said the military basis of the shock program teaches the inmates responsibility, discipline and respect, traits most had `` very little grounding'' in before. <PERSON> Conti </PERSON> said drug counseling helped her get over a cocaine addiction. Before shock camp, she said, `` I would n't have told you I was a drug addict. They taught me how to open up and deal with my problem.'' Other programs taught her she did n't `` always have to say something about everything. `` When I first came in here, I was trying to tell the lady how to run the community meeting. That's how I was. I would n't listen to anybody.'' The women who completed shock camp this month were effusive in praising the program and thanking the staff. That may be because the program is voluntary. Inmates who do n't like it can transfer back to a regular prison and their longer sentences. Troublemakers are sent back. The platoon of 15 started out with 25 women six months ago, most of them convicted of drug charges. One woman owes a month because she was hospitalized during her shock term. Another left for medical reasons. Five were kicked out because of disciplinary problems. Inmates like the three who chose to go back to prison `` ca n't take it any more,'' said <PERSON> Burke </PERSON> `` They do n't like getting yelled at. They do n't like getting up in the morning. They do n't like the responsibility. `` We do n't let them off the hook.'' While all of the graduating platoon spoke sincerely of new, brighter futures, the odds are that a few of them will get in trouble again. Shock inmates have a 17 percent to 19 percent recidivism rate, <PERSON> Burke </PERSON> said. However, the average prison inmate return rate is 25 percent. That improvement _ and the millions the state can save through shorter prison terms _ has prompted Gov. <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> to propose raising the current 26-year age cap for shock camp to 29. The shock programs operated by a growing number of states _ <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> also have graduated classes of women _ have attracted the attention of national drug policy chief <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>, who is interested in it for federal prisons. Several of the women leaving the camp about 50 miles west of <LOCATION> Albany </LOCATION> cried as they said their goodbyes to each other and to their guards, who kept up their drill sergeants' roles to the end. As the platoon fell into formation to march their last drill, chanting loudly, to the graduation ceremony, one officer barked: `` Do n't march like girls. March like shock graduates!''

<BYLINE>Where Are Automotive Stocks Headed?</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Through marketing ingenuity, incentives, good design, improved quality and sheer persistence, automakers have managed to stretch their selling cycle long beyond its usual lifespan. Now they are faced with another situation: With the delayed but inevitable end of their growth cycle appearing on the horizon, can they manage to maintain their stock prices until the next upturn? Automaking is a cyclical industry, meaning it has at least as many ups and downs as the economy itself. The pattern is as distinct as in real estate: a rising demand, overproduction, big inventories, a downturn and a recovery. It's been a bit different this time. Amid intense competition, the carmakers developed techniques to shift the production mix _ cars vs. trucks, for example _ offer discounts and below-market interest rates, and fine-tune production. In so doing they demonstrated that the cycle can indeed be stretched, if only to a point. Now, with indications it could snap _ July output may be at an annual rate of only 5 million cars, lowest for any month since 1982 _ you might think the appeal of automaker stocks would fall. But it might not. With industry earnings heading for a second-half decline, automotive stocks still remain in many portfolios, one reason being that analysts believe the automakers might be able to do for their stocks what they did for their sales. How do you keep stock prices up? _ By using the money you earned in the good times to buy back your stocks, as <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> are doing, thus tending to maintain the supply-demand ratio _ By maintaining dividends at a rate higher than most blue chips General Motors current dividend yield is 6.6 percent, <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>'s 6.2 percent and <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION>'s 4.8 percent. _ By making operations more efficient, thus buffering earnings to some degree against a sales downturn <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> often is cited as the best example of improved operating efficiency. Moreover, it chose to meet demand in the good days by expanding overtime rather than expanding plants. It costs less to reduce overtime than to close a plant. Still another factor, low price-earnings ratios, conceivably could protect share prices. <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> sells for six times earnings, <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> four and <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> five. For the market as a whole, the P-E is in the double digits. Reflecting some of these considerations, The Value Line Investment Survey offers these views of the Big Three automakers on the eve of a sales downturn: GENERAL MOTORS. `` We look for negative quarterly matchups for the remainder of ` 89, and expect the full-year's earnings to decline by about 12 percent ... These shares have impressive total return potential for the three - to five-year term In the meantime, -LRB- they -RRB- provide an above-average yield based on a secure payout ...'' FORD. `` We expect <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> shares to keep pace with the market in the year ahead, protected from most downside risk by a secure dividend that provides an attractive yield.'' <ORGANIZATION> CHRYSLER </ORGANIZATION>. `` Patient investors should keep this stock in mind. Although recent earnings comparisons suggest the stock is only likely to be an average performer in the year ahead, we project sharply improved earnings for the company by 1992-1994. If it turns out that way, the major automakers may have succeeded not just in muting the ups and downs of the car market but of the stock market too.''

 The drugs, booze, divorces and deaths may have softened the cockiness just a bit, but pioneer rocker <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> still has plenty left as he tries for a recording comeback spurred by a new movie on his tumultuous life. `` I'm as good as I ever was, if not better,'' <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> said about recent performances and his soundtrack for the movie `` Great Balls of Fire,'' starring <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Quaid </PERSON>. The soundtrack demonstrates that <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> still knows how to rock' n' roll, with remakes of such classics as `` Whole <PERSON> Lotta </PERSON> <PERSON> Shakin </PERSON>' Goin' On'' and `` Great Balls of Fire. As for the movie itself, <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> said he enjoyed <PERSON> Quaid </PERSON>'s acting but did n't give too many points to accuracy. `` This is a movie, and it needs to be accepted as just a movie.'' Initially, there was talk that <PERSON> Quaid </PERSON>, who has his own band, would perform at least some of the songs in the movie. <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> had to audition to get the job. `` All the way on the plane he was saying, ` This is ridiculous. <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> auditioning for himself.' But he pulled it off great,'' said his former manager, <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Schilling </PERSON>. <PERSON> Schilling </PERSON> is also creative projects manager for the Graceland Division of <ORGANIZATION> Elvis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Presley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enterprises </ORGANIZATION>. He and <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> parted this year after <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> was quoted in print as calling Presley a dummy who wasted his talent. `` <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> says some things that can be very damaging. A lot of times, he's striking out at himself,'' <PERSON> Schilling </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> wants to record again _ if he can do it his way. With his pumpin' piano and wild stage antics, <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> was at the top of the rock world in the late 1950s. Presley, then the undisputed king of rock' n' roll, had been drafted into the Army, and <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> was regarded as a possible contender for Presley's crown. But his rocket to fame, launched by records cut at the old <ORGANIZATION> Sun </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studio </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION>, was deflected by a scandal over his marriage to 13-year-old cousin <PERSON> Myra </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>. `` It totally destroyed his career,'' said the former Mrs. <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>, now <PERSON> Myra </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>. `` He went from making $ 10,000 a night to $ 200 a night. That's starvation wages when you're trying to travel on the road and pay a band.'' <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>, then 22, was advised to keep the marriage quiet, but he insisted on showing off his young bride on a concert tour to <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> knew the marriage would upset people, but he did n't care The reaction, however, was stronger than expected. `` It did n't quite go like I thought it was going to go,'' he said `` <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> has been headstrong all his life,'' <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said. `` You just could n't tell him anything. You could n't stop him from doing anything.'' Now married to a real estate broker in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> wrote the book on which the movie is based. At 53, <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> has been on the road all of his life, sometimes playing 200 or more dates a year. And though he's had long dry spells between records, and often found himself snarled by tangled finances and business squabbles, his stage show has kept its fire. His recording career, which peaked in the 1950s, blossomed again in the late'70s with such country hits as `` Middle-Age Crazy'' and `` I'm Gon na Find It Where I Can.'' He did well in the early ` 80s with `` 39 and Holding'' and `` Over the Rainbow,'' then took a break from recording to concentrate on live shows. `` I just got so tired and bogged down with that country style, slow-singing, beer-drinking type music. I just had to kind of get out of it,'' he said. `` It's great music, do n't get me wrong. But I like to rock' n' roll.'' <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> has made hundreds of thousands of dollars over his career, but he likes his money in cash and has tastes that run to flashy jewelry and fancy cars rather than ledger books. He filed for bankruptcy last year and has n't had a hit record in quite a while. He told the bankruptcy court he will make about $ 200,000 from `` Great Balls of Fire.'' Dogged by the <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, he's had trouble getting concert dates. The worst may be over, thanks to the movie and to efforts begun in 1987 to clean up his image with promoters. <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> recently completed a three-week stint in <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION> and headlined two large concerts in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>. But those jobs would have been closed to him two years ago. `` I tried to get him in <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION> for six months, and they literally laughed at me,'' <PERSON> Schilling </PERSON> said. `` Evidently, there was some bad past history with <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> in Vegas.''

<HEAD>Arab Day Labor Is Controversial Issue in Israel</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARJORIE OLSTER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>PETAH TIKVA, Israel (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A plan to keep Palestinian day laborers in a fenced-in compound while they wait to be hired in <ORGANIZATION> Petah </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tikva </ORGANIZATION> has fueled debate over the wisdom and morality of using Arabs to work in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. Critics of restrictions on <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> laborers say the practice is similar to what <PERSON> Nazis </PERSON> did to Jews in <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, but proponents maintain that after 18 months of a violent <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> uprising in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, restrictions are necessary for safety and security. Caught in the middle are the Arabs, who usually work as construction laborers, street cleaners, garbage collectors and at other menial jobs, and their employers, who pay them about half what <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> workers would have to be paid. In the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> settlement of Ariel, officials backed down from a plan to make the Arabs wear tags labeling them `` alien workers'' after critics compared them to the yellow Stars of <PERSON> David </PERSON> that Jews were forced to wear in <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. When the town council in <ORGANIZATION> Petah </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tikva </ORGANIZATION>, a city of 150,000 six miles east of <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION>, approved the holding area for Arab workers in May, some Israeli newspapers said it amounted to a `` temporary prison.'' The original plan called for a fenced-in holding pen where <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> workers would be required to show their identity cards and wait to be hired. But after the public outcry, the town decided to do away with plans for the fence and a legal requirement that workers wait inside. Instead, a metal-frame shelter with a green plastic roof was erected over three park benches; a portable toilet was put up nearby. On one recent day, the shelter was empty and several <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> workers waited at a corner about 100 yards away. `` People are afraid to go to the shelter,'' said one of the workers, identifying himself as only as <PERSON> Faisal </PERSON>. `` They are afraid of the police or of citizens here who might plant bombs or shoot guns at us.'' <PERSON> Avraham </PERSON> <PERSON> Oren </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Petah </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tikva </ORGANIZATION> town council member who opposes the shelter, said it would probably never be used because of the controversy it has caused. `` This idea that it is possible to put people in pens is like segregation of the races,'' he said. But council spokesman <PERSON> Shuki </PERSON> <PERSON> Yelin </PERSON> defended the shelter, saying it was meant to ease fears by Jewish parents that their children might be attacked by <PERSON> Arabs </PERSON> on the streets. `` We built it because ... many Jewish citizens protested and sent petitions, saying they are suffering because of the presence of the Arabs near their houses,'' <PERSON> Yelin </PERSON> said. `` It's not racist. We know we are criticized, but it's not a jail. We do n't force them to go. It's an open place.'' Similarly expressed fears have been behind other moves to restrict <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> workers. Mayor <PERSON> Zvi </PERSON> <PERSON> Zilker </PERSON> of the southern Israeli town of <LOCATION> Ashdod </LOCATION> temporarily barred all Palestinian laborers recently after a soldier was killed nearby and another disappeared and was believed kidnapped. Police said they suspected Palestinians from the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> in both cases. After the attacks on soldiers, the Israeli government also began requiring <PERSON> Gaza </PERSON> <PERSON> Arabs </PERSON> to obtain new work permits and restricting those with records of crime or security offenses. But right-wing calls for barring all Arab workers from <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> have brought an outcry from employers who depend on them. The issue has opened up a debate that touches not only <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s economy but also many Israelis' vision of their country as a bulwark of Jewish morality that does not condone exploiting the Arabs Professor <PERSON> Ehpraim </PERSON> <PERSON> Yuchtman-Yaar </PERSON>, a social psychologist at <ORGANIZATION> Tel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviv </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, says Israelis are torn between dependence on Arab workers and guilt over their treatment. `` People recognize the labor is vital for the Israeli economy,'' he said. `` They are doing low-status jobs that Israelis prefer not to do. But morally, many Israelis feel the Arabs should be treated equally to Jewish workers. ... Because they are not, it is exploitation and should be denounced.'' <PERSON> Moshe </PERSON> <PERSON> Semyonov </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Tel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviv </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> sociologist, says the segregation of Arabs is being fostered by a curious alliance between right-wing Israelis and traditionalists who see the use of <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> labor crushing their dream of an <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> built by Jews. `` People on both ends of the political spectrum are against depending on Arabs _ one out of antagonism, the other for humanistic or moral reasons,'' <PERSON> Semyonov </PERSON> said.

 <LOCATION> MEMPHIS </LOCATION>: in Vegas.'' Bad history has always been with <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>, and he has n't been bashful about letting people know that he acts how he likes, when he likes. `` <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> is a rebel. He's not some namby-pamby,'' said his sister, <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Gail </PERSON> <PERSON> Stefanow </PERSON>. `` I think he's a lot more of a hero than people realize. He would n't be <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> if he had lived his life differently.'' <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>, the first cousin and boyhood companion of TV evangelist <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON>, quit school at 16 and briefly tried preaching and selling sewing machines before focusing on rock' n' roll. He has had six wives. His fourth wife, <PERSON> Jaren </PERSON>, drowned in a swimming pool in 1982 while suing for divorce; his fifth wife, <PERSON> Shawn </PERSON>, 23 years his junior, died of an apparent drug overdose in 1983. Within a year, <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> married his sixth wife, <PERSON> Kerrie </PERSON>, 21, who filed for divorce in 1986, accusing him of roughing her up and infidelity. <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> countersued, but both petitions were dropped. The <ORGANIZATION> Lewises </ORGANIZATION> live with their 2-year-old son, <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, near <LOCATION> Nesbit </LOCATION>, Miss. <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> has bounced in and out of courtrooms throughout his life, suing or being sued over busted concert dates, troubled romances and other entanglements. He also has a history of alcohol and drug abuse, and in 1986, according to a former road manager, checked himself out of a detox program because he did n't like making his own bed. In 1976, <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> was detained by police after ramming his <ORGANIZATION> Lincoln </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> into the front gates of Presley's <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION> residence, Graceland, while armed with a .38 - caliber Admitting he had been drinking heavily, <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> told police he was called to Graceland because <PERSON> Presley </PERSON> was depressed and wanted to talk. Presley never commented publicly on the gate-ramming escapade, but Shilling, who was a member of Presley's entourage for 11 years, said the two performers were never close friends. `` You do n't call <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> if you're depressed,'' <PERSON> Schilling </PERSON> said The son of a one-time bootlegger, <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> was born in <LOCATION> Ferriday </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> La. </LOCATION>, and taught himself to play the piano as a child. His early plans were to become a piano-playing preacher, and he gave a brief try at attending a fundamentalist bible college in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> following his first marriage, at age 16. <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>' third marriage, to <PERSON> Myra </PERSON>, set off cries from parents across the country that it was irrefutable evidence of the dangers of rock' n' roll. But marrying young was nothing new to <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>' family. His sister <PERSON> Frankie </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> married at 12, and <PERSON> Gail </PERSON>, who has been married seven times, first wed at 14. `` I think we're oversexed,'' said <PERSON> Gail </PERSON> <PERSON> Stefanow </PERSON>, who toured as a backup singer with her brother for 15 years. <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> has been fighting the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> for more than a decade. He went to trial for tax evasion in 1984 and was acquitted, but the government said he still owed more than $ 650,000. In fighting the tax charges, <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>' lawyer presented his client as an uneducated country boy overwhelmed by trying to keep up with the thousands of dollars he was making, much of it paid in cash. The government said $ 31,000 was found stuffed in a paper bag at the singer's <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> home, and a former girlfriend said <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> once gave her $ 80,000 in a shoe box to keep for him while he was hospitalized. <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> nearly died from a ruptured stomach in 1981 and has since had much of his stomach removed. He still gets out from time to time for late-night drinks at his favorite bars, but is becoming more of a homebody since the birth of his new son. <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>' first son, <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, was killed in a traffic accident at age 19. Aother son, <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON>, drowned in a swimming pool at age 3. He also has two daughters. <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> acknowledged that many of the lumps and bumps in his life may have been of his own doing, but he stopped short of offering any apology. `` I do n't think I overshot my runway,'' he said. `` I'm still rockin', brother ... and I did it my way.''

<TEXT>
 Early in 1988, a letter composed by four Israeli writers appeared in <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> urging American Jews to speak out against <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s violent crackdown of <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> protesters in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. One of the writers was A.B. <PERSON> Yehoshua </PERSON>, whose novels include `` A Late Divorce'' and the recently released `` Five Seasons'' -LRB- Doubleday, $ 19.95 -RRB-. <PERSON> Yehoshua </PERSON>, <PERSON> Amos </PERSON> <PERSON> Oz </PERSON>, <PERSON> Yehuda </PERSON> <PERSON> Amichai </PERSON> and other Israeli writers uphold a tradition of active participation in their country's politics. Zionism, or Jewish statehood, they note, was created by a writer _ <PERSON> Theodor </PERSON> <PERSON> Herzl </PERSON>. `` The main figures of the first Zionist congress were writers,'' said <PERSON> Yehoshua </PERSON>, professor of literature at <ORGANIZATION> Haifa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. `` By their imagination they understood what was going to happen to the Jewish people.'' <PERSON> Avraham </PERSON> <PERSON> Bulli </PERSON> <PERSON> Yehoshua </PERSON> was born in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> in 1936 at a time when the city was part of British-controlled <LOCATION> Palestine </LOCATION>. When he was 12 years old, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> was granted independence and won a fierce war with Arabs for possession of the land. `` I remember always sitting under the shelters and being without food. I remember the fighting, the shelling, the bullets. I was worried about my father, who was working in the secret service, listening to the Arabs' telephone calls,'' he said. He did n't originally want to be a writer, dreaming instead about a legal career. But as a teen-ager, <PERSON> Yehoshua </PERSON> joined a youth group and impressed his peers with humorous pieces about local events. He continued to write while serving in the army. `` I was writing about things in the unit _ creating absurd situations in a very fantastic kind of style, describing what was inside the camp. This was the idea: absurd stories, fantastic stories.'' His first published work, a short story about a dying man, was also an absurdist piece. `` He's still alive but the old woman decides to bury him alive, to get rid of him,'' <PERSON> Yehoshua </PERSON> said about the work. `` The neighbors are participating in this live burial, and I'm writing about how this can be achieved.'' <PERSON> Yehoshua </PERSON> soon became influenced by the works of <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Faulkner </PERSON>, admiring the great Southern writer's stream-of-consciousness prose and blending of myth and reality. The use of myth is important for an Israeli writer. `` We do n't have a long history as an independent country so you have to relate yourself to some myth,'' <PERSON> Yehoshua </PERSON> said `` <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> has changed so radically it's unbelieveable.'' A self-described `` dove'' who favors talks between <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> and eventual <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> self-determination, recalled a short story he had written in 1962: `` A student is sent to a forest because he did n't finish his studies and his friends are advising him to finish his thesis. So he's sent to a forest. There's an Arab in the distance planning to set fire to the forest because it was built on his village. Finally, the forest is set on fire. `` In 1962, it was an indication that the Palestinian problem was being repressed. The Palestinian problem has been coming, expecially in the last year. It's a sign that the Israelis have to realize the limits of Zionism.'' Politics are not mentioned directly in `` Five Seasons,'' which chronicles the difficulties of a middle-aged government bureaucrat, <PERSON> Molkho </PERSON>, in adjusting to the death of his wife, who succumbs to cancer at the start of the novel. <PERSON> Molkho </PERSON> anxiously seeks companionship, flying to <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> for a weekend with the legal adviser from work, and spending time with the wife of his old youth group counselor, who has encouraged the meeting. But <PERSON> Molkho </PERSON> is unable to connect with either woman, as the grief over his late wife makes him alternately abrupt and distant, incapable of understanding their feelings. `` My point in this book is that this was the year <PERSON> Molkho </PERSON> thinks he'll be free,'' <PERSON> Yehoshua </PERSON> said. `` Without believing in ghosts he interiorizes his wife in such a way that she's still alive after her death. And this is the way he has to struggle until then he's liberated. Where `` A Late Divorce'' showed <PERSON> Faulkner </PERSON>'s unmistakable influence, <PERSON> Yehoshua </PERSON>'s writing in `` Five Seasons'' is in keeping with his main character: restrained, introverted and obsessed with minor details. `` It had to be much more subtle,'' the author said. `` When you are writing stream-of-consciousness, everything has to get out. With this, there's what you say and what you do n't say. There's a gap between the two. In a way, I was returning to the style of my short stories.'' In one passage, <PERSON> Yehoshua </PERSON> describes <PERSON> Molkho </PERSON>'s thoughts while attending a dinner party given by the legal adviser: `` The conversation rambled intimately. Though he had prepared a few subjects to talk about, especially several of a legal nature, he saw at once that he need n't make the effort, for everyone appeared harmoniously acquainted and he, it seemed, was passed back and forth among them in a discreet and unaffected fashion. `` Afraid of being suspected of some organic problem if he went to the toilet too soon, he sat with his legs together to ease the pressure on his bladder while one by one the men came up to him, introducing themselves once again ...'' <PERSON> Yehoshua </PERSON> is a strong critic of the diaspora, the dispersion of Jews around the world, stating that the failure of Jewish people to return to their homeland presents a greater threat than the Arabs to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s national security. Yet in the final chapter of `` Five Seasons,'' <PERSON> Molkho </PERSON> helps an unhappy Russian-born girl return to her home country. `` It was a healthy thing for her to do,'' <PERSON> Yehoshua </PERSON> explained. `` I do n't tell you to stay. You have to feel natural. By understanding the Russian's feelings, <PERSON> Molkho </PERSON> can better understand himself and demonstrate his belonging to the country.''

 Declining interest rates that have pushed conventional mortgage rates below single digits also have spurred loan refinancings by many homeowners wanting to cut their house payments and their ties to fickle adjustable rate mortgages. `` We're seeing a rash of these variable rate loans coming for refinancing to a fixed rate, even some where their current -LRB- ARM -RRB- rate is lower,'' <PERSON> Angelo </PERSON> <PERSON> Mozilo </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Countrywide </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Funding </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Pasadena </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, said Monday.

 Homeowners increasingly have been refinancing their mortgages as interest rates drop and adjustable-rate home loans lose some of their luster, according to those in the industry. `` We're seeing a rash of these variable rate loans coming for refinancing to a fixed rate, even some where their current -LRB- ARM -RRB- rate is lower,'' said <PERSON> Angelo </PERSON> <PERSON> Mozilo </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Countrywide </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Funding </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Pasadena </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, one of the nation's largest mortgage lending companies. `` -LRB- And -RRB- we're getting inquiries by the thousands,'' he said Monday. Mortgage rates, particularly on conventional fixed-rate loans, have declined steadily in recent weeks as market interest rates dropped amid continued signs the economy and inflation are cooling. In the past month, more and more lenders have dropped their 30-year conventional mortgage rates to below 10 percent for the first time in about 16 months. <ORGANIZATION> HSH </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION>, a Butler, N.J.-based mortgage reserach firm, said 10.5 percent of the 2,000 mortgage lenders surveyed last week dropped their fixed rates to 9 percent to 9.9 percent, compared with about two dozen at the end of May. The national average for 30-year loans was 10.3 percent, while the average for one-year ARMs was 9 percent, the survey said. Some lenders say the drop in interest rates has helped spur interest in new and existing homes lately. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Realtors </ORGANIZATION> reported Monday that existing home sales fell 5.6 percent to their lowest level in 16 months. However, some experts predicted the pace would pick up this summer as the full impact of the rate drop was felt. Right now, ARM holders with rates in the 11 percent to 14 percent range have become the first to cash in on the rate decline by rushing to lock in lower, fixed rates, industry experts said. ARMs are adjusted up or down at specified intervals to reflect prevailing interest rates, usually one-year <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bills. In many cases, ARM rates may be raised by up to 2 percentage points a year, or 6 percentage points over the life of the loan. For someone who received a $ 100,000 ARM three years ago with a 7.5 percent rate the first year of the loan, monthly payments would total $ 902.78. But payments could rise to $ 1,361.11 a month this year, if the rate rose to the maximum 13.5 percent. Experts say homeowners should consider refinancing if prevailing market rates fall at least two percentage points below their mortgage rate. Otherwise, with closing costs running anywhere from 3 to 5 percentage points of the refinanced loan, it may not be worth it, they said. The rush to refinance appears to be spotty, according to experts. <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Koons </PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Chase </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manhattan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s home mortgage division, said he's seen a sharp increase in refinancings in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, where ARMs are particularly popular. He said half of the current mortgage applications there were for refinancings. But <PERSON> Ronnie </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wynn </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Colonial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mortgage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Montgomery </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ala. </LOCATION>, said refinancings made up only 1.5 percent of outstanding mortgages, compared with 40 percent in 1986 and 1987, when interest rates were significantly lower. `` Refinancings are up a little bit but most of the people who had interest rates of 12 percent or above, where it would be worthwhile to refinance, refinanced in'86 or'87,'' <PERSON> Wynn </PERSON> said. `` I do think we'll see them -LRB- refinancings -RRB- pick up as interest rates fall.'' For homeowners with ARMs that started out with low interest rates the first year but headed higher each year as overall interest rates rose, refinanicng means more than securing a steady rate. `` It's brought peace of mind for some people,'' said <PERSON> Mozilo </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Countrywide </ORGANIZATION>, where 10 percent of the $ 800 million are loan applications are for refinancings. `` Many people were very naive to the consequences of these adjustable rate mortgages. Of course, many people also could n't qualify to buy a home without ARMs.''

 A new generation of supersonic jetliners might be built, but only if manufacturers can conquer the immense environmental, technical and economic problems of a plane that would fly at twice the speed of sound while costing twice as much as a 747, a <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> official says. `` This is <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> dreaming,'' said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Henderson </PERSON>, manager of High-Speed Commercial Transport studies for <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION>. `` But it's our job in new airplane development to protect the future of the company. About 70 <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> employees has been looking at whether a new supersonic transport could be flying within the next 20 years. The early outlook, <PERSON> Henderson </PERSON> said Monday, is that it could be done, but not easily. <PERSON> Henderson </PERSON> said that <ORGANIZATION> McDonnell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> _ the only other <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> maker of commercial jets _ the Europeans and the Japanese also have looked at new-generation SSTs, and appear to have reached similar conclusions. `` We and <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> have been working on parallel paths,'' said <ORGANIZATION> McDonnell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Keith </PERSON> <PERSON> Takahashi </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> McDonnell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION> each received $ 4.5 million from the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> for a two-year study on the feasibility of a new SST Both companies decided to continue the research after the study ended last fall. <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> declined to say how much it has spent so far. <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> pinned a lot of hopes and a lot of money in the late 1960s on building an SST. When the government canceled the program over environmental concerns, it contributed to the <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> slump that plunged <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>, its headquarters city, into hard times in the early 1970s. Because of this, <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> executives have said they are wary of committing the hundreds of millions of dollars it would take to build a new SST. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Albrecht </PERSON>, executive vice president of <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Commercial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airplanes </ORGANIZATION> division, has said that while the Concorde SST has been successful as a premium trans-Atlantic service, he doubts anyone would build _ nor would airlines buy _ a plane that must command a much higher ticket price to serve a niche market. The Anglo-French Concorde began flying passengers in 1976. Only about a dozen of the sleek jets now fly, operated by <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> France </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION>, and are severely limited in routes because of noisy engines and ear-rattling sonic boom resulting from it flying about twice the speed of sound. <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> is studying a plane capable of flying 1.8 to 2.5 times the speed of sound, or roughly 1,330 to 1,850 mph. That would permit it to fly from <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> in 4 hours 20 minutes, compared with the 10 hours, 20 minutes a non-stop subsonic flight takes today. <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> doubts a faster plane would be practical, because it would require new fuels such as liquid natural gas or liquid hydrogen, and special airport facilities, <PERSON> Henderson </PERSON> said. Further, a plane that could fly 2,500 mph or better would have scant time at cruising speed on a 5,000-mile trans-Pacific flight. <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION>'s four-engine <ORGANIZATION> HSCT </ORGANIZATION>, a long, languid curve in profile, is envisioned to be about 293 feet long, 60 feet longer than a 747-400 jumbo jet, with a wingspan of just 142 feet, or 70 feet less than the 747-400. It would haul 200 to 300 passengers about 5,000 nautical miles non-stop. The Concorde is about 204 feet long with an 84-foot wingspan and carries 100 to 128 passengers 3,360 nautical miles non-stop. By using engine noise suppressors, <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> planners think their <ORGANIZATION> HSCT </ORGANIZATION> could meet the government's strict new standards for airport noise. Sonic boom is another matter. `` We saw no way and still see no way we could reduce sonic boom to acceptable levels over land,'' <PERSON> Henderson </PERSON> said. Another environmental worry is possible damage to the ozone layer. By limiting the plane to under <ORGANIZATION> Mach </ORGANIZATION> 3, or three times the speed of sound, it could still fly below the ozone layer, in the troposphere, where engine emissions should be dispersed, <PERSON> Henderson </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> HSCT </ORGANIZATION> would require some yet-to-be developed technology, especially in lightweight composite materials. Just as critical is making the plane economical to fly, he said. <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> estimates air traffic in 2015 will be about 1.9 million passenger miles per day, roughly twice what it is now. About a third of all passengers would be on routes that could be served by an <ORGANIZATION> HSCT </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Henderson </PERSON> said. The problem, he said, is that to compete, an <ORGANIZATION> HSCT </ORGANIZATION> has to offer a ticket price roughly the same as the newer and cheaper-to-operate long-range widebody jets. That could be tough, he said, for a plane that probably would cost twice as much as a 747-400, which sells for about $ 125 million. In <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION>'s market research, `` even an optimistic look says that if you were to increase the ticket prices by as much as 20 percent, we'd lose over half the market,'' he said.

<HEAD>Time Rejects Sweetened Paramount Bid</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> has rejected <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>'s $ 12.2 billion takeover bid, noting that the sweetened offer is subject to the same unresolved conditions as <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION>'s earlier $ 10.7 billion proposal. Time's board, which turned down the revised $ 200-a-share bid Monday, also called the offer financially inadequate, and the media giant restated its intention to pursue a $ 14 billion tender offer of its own for <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` The <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION> offer remains as highly conditional and conjectural as it was when <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION> started it nearly three weeks ago,'' Time said in a statement Monday. Paramount has conditioned its buyout on being able to obtain financing for the deal _ which it did not accomplish while its earlier $ 175-a-share bid was on the table _ and on obtaining the rights to operate about 800 cable television systems Time owns. The bid is also contingent upon the termination of Time's merger agreement with <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION>. Time, which has focused on these conditions in its campaign against <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION>, claims they will prevent the Paramount bid from being completed and has urged its shareholders not to be tempted by the size of the offer. `` It's not just the question of price,'' Time Vice Chairman <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Levin </PERSON> said in a telephone interview Monday. Paramount was undaunted by the latest rejection. `` We will continue to pursue our acquisition of Time in a calm, studied and deliberate manner,'' it said in a statement. Time announced its rejection of the Paramount bid after the close of trading on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. Time stock seesawed in nervous trading as investors awaited the board's response, rising as high as $ 172.25 a share before closing at $ 164 a share, down $ 1.87 -LCB- from Friday's close. Securities analysts had expected Time to reject any sweetened bid. However, observers said they did not expect <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION> to raise its offer again and <PERSON> Levin </PERSON> indicated the company expected the takeover struggle to be resolved in <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Chancery </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Court </LOCATION>, where Paramount has sued to block Time's planned $ 70-a-share buyout of <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION>. A key issue before the court in <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> _ where all three companies are incorporated _ is whether <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> put itself up for sale, thereby opening itself up to the bid from <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION>, when it announced its merger agreement with <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> in March. Time and <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> originally agreed to merge in a stock-for-stock transaction but revised their merger agreement to provide for <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION>'s tender offer after Paramount announced its first bid on June 6 Paramount contends that Time's tender offer for <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> was begun solely as a defense against the Paramount bid. `` I just believe that when the court looks at these issues, that there's a fairly persuasive case that we have a transaction that has not been done defensively ...'' <PERSON> Levin </PERSON> said. `` It's something we've studied for so long. When they announced their plans to merge, <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> said they had been negotiating over two years. Time stated that its board based its unanimous rejection of the Paramount bid partly on the opinions of its financial advisers, <PERSON> Wasserstein </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Perella </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, that the offer was inadequate. `` Paramount's original offer of $ 175 was absurdly low,'' Time Chairman <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Munro </PERSON> stated. `` Paramount's revised offer has not changed the conclusion of our management and board that the acquisition of <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> by Time is in the best interests of Time and its stockholders.'' Meanwhile, speculation continued on Wall Street that Paramount itself might be the target of a hostile bid. Investors bid Paramount stock up $ 2.37 -LCB- a share to $ 60.37 -LCB- Monday. <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> stock was up 25 cents a share to $ 58.87 -LCB-. Also Monday, two large <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> shareholders, <ORGANIZATION> Robert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> M. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bass </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Limited </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partners </ORGANIZATION> and a partnership of the <ORGANIZATION> Cablevision </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Perenchio </PERSON>, filed suit in <ORGANIZATION> Delaware </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chancery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> seeking to block Time's annual meeting, scheduled for Friday. Bass and the Cablevision-Perenchio group have been mentioned as possible bidders for some of <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION>'s assets, <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> reported in Tuesday's editions.

 The dollar was mixed in quiet, early European trading today, and foreign currency dealers said the market was waiting for cues from economic news to be released this week. Gold prices fell. `` The dollar is completely flat today,'' said one trader in <LOCATION> Milan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>. He said investors were uncertain about where to go and were waiting for Thursday's release of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> leading economic indicators and for the outcome of the West German central bank's policy meeting the same day. In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, where trading ends before <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s business day begins, the dollar rose 1.05 yen to a closing 141.23 yen. Later, in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, it was quoted higher at 141.35 yen. Other dollar rates at midmorning, compared with late Monday's prices, included: 1.9558 West German marks, up from 1.9552; 1.6840 Swiss francs, unchanged; 6.6343 French francs, down from 6.6380; 2.2045 Dutch guilders, up from 2.2003; 1,415.55 Italian lire, up from 1,414.00; and 1.1943 Canadian dollars, up from 1.19405 The dollar fell slightly against the British pound in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. It cost $ 1.5495 to buy one pound, compared with $ 1.5450 late Monday. Gold opened in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> at a bid price of $ 374.30 a troy ounce, compared with late Monday's $ 375.25. At midmorning, the city's five major bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of $ 373.55. In <LOCATION> Zurich </LOCATION>, the bid price was $ 373.85, down from $ 374.25 late Monday. Earlier, in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, gold fell $ 1.15 to close at a bid of $ 375.11.

 The dollar rose sharply against the Japanese yen today, while the <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>'s main index plunged. The dollar closed at 141.23 yen, up 1.05 yen from Monday's close of 140.18 yen. It opened at 141.15 yen and fluctuated between 140.90 yen and 141.30 yen. The dollar had fallen 4.77 yen in three trading days before today's rebound. <PERSON> Mitsuhiko </PERSON> <PERSON> Kinugasa </PERSON>, a trader at <ORGANIZATION> Daiwa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>, said the rebound mainly reflected position adjustments. `` Nothing happened today,'' he added. `` There were no buying incentives, there were no releases of major economic indicators this week, there was no central bank intervention _ nothing.'' <PERSON> Kinugasa </PERSON> said, `` The yen's sharp rebound last week has come to a halt, and the majority of investors are now avoiding major moves until they find a new trend in the market.'' The dollar had risen to a nearly two-year high closing of 151.30 on June 15 before heading back down. On the stock market, the 225-issue <ORGANIZATION> Nikkei </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Average </ORGANIZATION> lost 156.61 points, or 0.47 percent, closing at 33,469.21. The market's main barometer had gained 95.11 points Monday <PERSON> Masahiro </PERSON> <PERSON> Umemori </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Nomura </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION>, said the index fell mainly because of the yen's decline against the dollar and the governing <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s loss in a parliamentary by-election on Sunday. `` Japanese investors were reluctant to buy issues because of uncertainties over the direction of the foreign exchange and pessimism over performance in the upper house election,'' he said. Elections for half the seats in the upper house are scheduled for July 23. Other dealers said speculative investors sold spot issues for arbitrage deals between the spot and the futures markets, prompting the Nikkei's fall in the afternoon session. Trading was thin, with first section volume estimated at 500 million shares, up from Monday's 430 million.

 <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> and its pilots' union are negotiating under court supervision over the strike-bound company's attempt to cancel the pilots' contract and impose wage concessions The <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Line </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pilots </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> and Eastern were to meet for a second day today after Monday's first session ordered by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Bankruptcy Judge <PERSON> Burton </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lifland </PERSON> produced `` nothing fruitful,'' said a union spokesman. The meeting was the first between <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> ALPA </ORGANIZATION> since the airline last week sought court permission to cancel its contract with the pilots. The two sides met at the offices of <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shapiro </PERSON>, the court-appointed examiner overseeing the airline on behalf of the bankruptcy court. <ORGANIZATION> ALPA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Ashby </PERSON> said Monday's meeting was mainly a `` feeling-out process, a discussion of basic issues.'' Eastern declined comment. Other <ORGANIZATION> ALPA </ORGANIZATION> officials said they did not expect <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> to offer the job-security provisions the union says would be necessary for an agreement. Most of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s pilots and flight attendants have been honoring the pickets of the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> since the machinists began their strike March 4, forcing the carrier to sharply cut back the number of its flights. A <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee plans this week to examine the impact of the nearly four-month-old strike and a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> panel has asked the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> to assess the impact of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s proposed reorganization on the airline industry. Six senators also are asking <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> to block Eastern, at least temporarily, from selling more assets as part of the airline's reorganization plan. Eastern last week asked the bankruptcy judge for permission to impose about $ 50 million in wage and benefit concessions, as well as changes in work policies that would allow <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> to increase pilots' hours. Eastern said it needed contract concessions from the pilots as part of its plan to reorganize and emerge from Chapter 11 bankruptcy protections as a smaller carrier. A consultant to the pilots' union said over the weekend that <PERSON> Shapiro </PERSON> would oppose <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s bid to terminate the contract. <PERSON> Shapiro </PERSON> did not return calls seeking comment Monday and <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> said it was n't aware of <PERSON> Shapiro </PERSON>'s position. The unions contend <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> and its parent company, <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, are trying to use the bankruptcy court to destroy <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s unions <PERSON> Lifland </PERSON> would have to approve <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s reorganization plan, which includes major asset sales. The unions have unsuccessfully sought the sale of Eastern. <PERSON> Lifland </PERSON> said three weeks ago the court would no longer consider the buyout offer of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> commodities trader <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Ritchie </PERSON>, although he said <PERSON> Ritchie </PERSON> was free to pursue his offer with Eastern. On <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> has requested the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> investigation, saying in a letter that its review `` should examine whether the proposed business plan of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> has any realistic prospect of revitalizing the carrier.'' In a separate letter to <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON>, six senators called on the transportation secretary to `` seek a delay in additional sales that could further erode the competitive base in the airline industry.'' The senators specifically cited <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s reported plan to sell its South American routes.

 The stock market rose in early trading today, bouncing back from Monday's round of selling. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was up 12.71 to 2,524.09 in the first 30 minutes of trading. Gainers outnumbers losers by about 3 to 2 in nationwide trading of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> Exchange-listed stocks, with 576 up, 343 down and 517 unchanged. Volume on the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> came to 24.58 million shares at 10 a.m. on Wall Street. The early gains indicated the impact of Monday's more than 20-point decline in the Dow industrials may have waned. But there was little economic news or other factors that appeared to be driving the market early today. The stock market advanced last week to new highs following the 1987 crash amid gathering signs of a slowing economy. The Dow Jones industrials average gained 66 points on Thursday and Friday alone.

 <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> leaders today agreed on a compromise plan for gradually unifying their economies after <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> succeeded in blocking attempts to create a single currency and a central bank. `` We have conceded nothing at all,'' <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> said at the end of a two-day summit. However, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, which were aligned against <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> in the dispute over broad plans to unify the economies, also declared themselves pleased with the compromise pact. Closer monetary union is part of the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION>'s drive toward December 1992, when the member nations will drop trade barriers to form a single market. West German Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> said the agreement at the end of a two-day <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> summit was a `` superb result. `` The foundation has been laid for a development that brings the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> further together and brings political union one step nearer,'' <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> told reporters. The 12 <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> leaders have been divided over how far and how fast to go toward closer economic and monetary union as part of the establishment of a single Europe-wide market in 1992. In a final communique, the leaders endorsed only part of a sweeping plan for monetary union drawn up by <PERSON> Jacques </PERSON> <PERSON> Delors </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION>'s executive body, the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. The communique avoided setting any deadline on the more controversial aspects of the plan: creating a single currency and a central bank. But it did provide for the calling of the intergovernmental conference on those proposals, something Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> had sought to avoid. French President <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> said he would call an intergovernmental conference after next year. The conference can be called by a simple majority, but once there any member nation could then veto the changes. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> also agreed in principle to link the pound to the exchange rate mechanism that aligns the value of the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION>'s major currencies. But Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> hedged the move, which she has long resisted, with strict conditions. These included that <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s 8.3 percent inflation must drop to near the 4.5 percent average in the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> and that arrangements for the single market must be complete. Besides <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, some smaller <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> nations, including <LOCATION> The </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Luxembourg </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION>, have also expressed reservations about the <PERSON> Delors </PERSON> plan. <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> and Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> clashed repeatedly during the summit behind closed doors, officials reported, and jibed publicly at each other afterward. Each claimed that it was the other who was the other who had been most isolated at the conference. `` It was not me who was isolated,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>. `` It was President <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> agreed with a French radio interviewer that Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> was the `` brake'' on <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. She retorted at a news conference, `` Its a bit rich, is n't it _ someone who has not got freedom of capital movement ... calling me a brake on <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. He has scarcely got into the car.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>, adopting a more conciliatory manner than usual at this summit, agreed Monday to support in principle the linking of the British pound to a system that aligns the major <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> currencies. Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> rejects full monetary integration as surrendering to the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> national policy-making powers on budgetary and other financial matters. <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> conference said he was `` very satisfied'' with the summit. Asked if he was angry about Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s resistance to the <PERSON> Delors </PERSON> plan, which he strongly favored, he said, `` One should not confuse a certain firmness with anger.'' He added smiling, `` I am used to her ... she's very nice.''

<HEAD>Trade Deficit Improves Dramatically</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A 6 percent increase in exports helped <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s merchandise trade deficit narrow more sharply than expected to 1.72 billion pounds in May, the government said Tuesday The figures provided some evidence that the government's strategy of cooling the economy with high interest rates was working. The numbers raised hopes that interest rates, which stand at 14 percent, wo n't be pushed higher again. The British pound and stock prices rose after the figures were announced. The seasonally adjusted deficit compared with a shortfall of 2.16 billion pounds, or $ 3.35 billion, in April, the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industry </ORGANIZATION> said. The current account deficit shrank to 1.32 billion pounds from 1.76 billion pounds. The current account includes invisible trade such as overseas investment earnings. Invisible trade was estimated to be in surplus by 400 million pounds. The figures compared with market expectations of a merchandise trade gap of 2.1 billion pounds and a current account deficit of 1.6 billion pounds. Exports totaled 7.58 billion pounds, up from 7.14 billion pounds. The department attributed 243 million pounds of the rise to aircraft deals. Imports were flat at 9.3 billion pounds. Since the beginning of 1989, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s merchandise trade deficit has grown to 9.74 billion pounds compared with a deficit of 7.06 billion pounds a year earlier.

 Grain and soybean futures prices were mostly higher in early trading today on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> although there was little fresh news of interest to the markets. The modest advance in corn and soybean prices suggested those markets had already discounted the beneficial effects of overnight rains in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> and that some traders viewed Monday's steep losses as excessive.

The <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> issued its weekly crop update after the close of trading Monday, rating the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> corn and soybean crops in mostly fair to good condition as of Sunday. The <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> said most spring wheat was in good shape and winter wheat harvesting was about 25 percent complete, compared to 49 percent on the same date last year. In early trading, wheat was 2 cents to 3 -RCB- cents higher with the contract for delivery in July at $ 4.05 -LCB- a bushel; corn was 1 \ cents to 2 cents higher with July at $ 2.59 a bushel; oats were 1 cent to 1 -LCB- cents higher with July at $ 1.49 -RCB- a bushel; soybeans were unchanged to 3 cents higher with July at $ 7.31 a bushel Cattle futures were moderately lower and most pork futures were down sharply in early trading on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>.

 Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> has proposed establishing an Asian trade alliance involving the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the emerging economic powers of the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rim </LOCATION>. Although he did n't provide a detailed blueprint, <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> told a black-tie dinner of the <ORGANIZATION> Asia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>, a non-profit group, late Monday his plan would focus on coordinating the region's trade and economic policies.

 Share prices ended sharply higher on the <ORGANIZATION> London </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> Tuesday as recent fears of a rise in British interest rates were soothed by a surprising narrowing of the British trade deficit in May. Adding further momentum to the market's rise were strong gains in early Wall Street trading. The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index finished 26.8 points, or 1.2 percent, higher at 2,206.4, just 1.1 points below its peak. It was the first time the key index closed above 2,200 points in more than five weeks. At its lowest, the index was down 5.8 points at late morning, as players anxiously waited for the release of the May trade report. Volume accelerated to a moderate 498.2 million shares from 369.9 million shares on Monday. Share prices took their cue from the British pound, which rallied on the strength of the trade report and on news that Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> had reached an agreement on plans for monetary union with other European leaders meeting in <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>. `` Anything at the moment that is good news for sterling is good news for interest rates, which is good news for the -LRB- equity -RRB- market,'' one dealer said. <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> 30-share index was up 20.4 points at 1,829.7. <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> 500-share index rose 11.27 points to 1,249.56.

 A federal judge today ordered nearly 43,000 coal miners in nine states to end a wildcat strike and go back to work. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Knapp </PERSON> issued the indefinite restraining order against the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> at the request of the National Labor Relations Board. The nearly 43,000 miners walked out in support of 1,900 <ORGANIZATION> UMW </ORGANIZATION> members who have been on strike against <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> since April 5. UMW Vice President <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Corcoran </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> did not immediately return a telephone call. Miners have ignored previous restraining orders and remained off the job. <PERSON> Knapp </PERSON> said union officials must report to the <ORGANIZATION> NLRB </ORGANIZATION> within 10 days on what steps they have taken to meet the court order. The judge could have restricted the back-to-work order to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> and parts of <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, but instead made it nationwide, ordering that it apply to all coal companies with whom the <ORGANIZATION> UMW </ORGANIZATION> has contracts. About 1,600 <ORGANIZATION> UMW </ORGANIZATION> miners in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> went on strike against <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> on April 5 after working 14 months without a contract. They were joined by 300 <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> miners in <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> earlier this month. That strike spurred wildcat sympathy walkouts beginning June 12 in <LOCATION> Appalachia </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION>. At one point, 46,000 miners in <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> were off the job. Missouri's miners went back to work on Monday Most of the nation's union miners began their two-week vacations this week, and the coal fields have been relatively quiet since the weekend. On Monday, a second attempt by Gov. <PERSON> Gaston </PERSON> <PERSON> Caperton </PERSON> to mediate in the 11-week-old <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> walkout fell short when <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> declined to say whether he would meet with <ORGANIZATION> UMW </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Trumka </PERSON>. <PERSON> Caperton </PERSON> had invited <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> and <PERSON> Trumka </PERSON> last week to meet at the governor's mansion. But <PERSON> Caperton </PERSON> attached several conditions unacceptable to <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON>, including asking that <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> not use other coal companies to fill its orders and that other companies suspend any lawsuits against the <ORGANIZATION> UMW </ORGANIZATION> over the strikes. The governor's latest offer contained no conditions.

 There are more than balmy breezes blowing from the south. Hundreds of sweet-talking scam operators are working the telephones to con victims out of a few hundred dollars or, in some cases, their life savings. Investigators estimate 90 percent of all the major `` boiler room'' telemarketing schemes in the nation are based in either <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, with affluent <LOCATION> Orange </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, dethroning <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lauderdale </LOCATION> several years ago as the country's scam capital. The pitches are limited only by the imagination _ from oil wells to medical breakthroughs; worm ranches to low-cost precious metals _ and rope in nearly $ 1 billion annually, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. Officials say the best salesmen can mold a lump of truth into a monument of credibility and disguise a sham as a once-in-a-lifetime deal. `` These boiler room guys like life in the fast lane: the yachts, the fancy cars, the sunshine,'' said <PERSON> Kent </PERSON> <PERSON> Neal </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Broward </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Crime </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Unit </ORGANIZATION> based in <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lauderdale </LOCATION>. `` <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> offer the kind of lifestyle they want.'' Scam artists also like southern climes for their transient populations and ready pools of pitchmen. `` Some of the ads they run specifically target struggling actors or musicians,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Katz </PERSON>, coordinator of the <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fraud </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Task </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> based in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. `` In an way, it's like an acting job They try to give the pitch as sincerely and convincingly as possible. Too many times it works.'' Tougher state laws and more aggressive enforcement have driven many boiler room operators from the <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lauderdale </LOCATION> area, but <PERSON> Neal </PERSON> estimates about 80 large telemarketing fraud operations still carry on from <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Palm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Katz </PERSON> said at least 150 boiler rooms have staked out <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, with most centered around <LOCATION> Newport </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>. The boiler room's ability to survive is partially due to lack of coordination betwen federal and state law enforcement agencies and the con artists' nomadic instincts, say investigators. `` When the law gets too close, they pack up shop and begin again,'' said Deputy State Attorney <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Sheldon </PERSON>, a boiler room specialist based in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION>. The first telephone scams began in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> in the 1920s, when salesmen would pitch mosquito-infested swampland as prime property. The boiler rooms _ so called for their typically spartan surroundings _ did not flourish again until the 1970s. This time, sure-bet oil and gas fields and inexpensive gems and gold dominated the pitches, said <PERSON> Neal </PERSON>. One of <PERSON> Neal </PERSON>'s favorite souvenirs from the early'80s heyday of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> boiler rooms is a piece of wood carved and painted to resemble a gold bar. It was found with others in the vaults of <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gold </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bullion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, one of the boldest and most notorious fraud scams on record. From unusually swank offices in a <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lauderdale </LOCATION> skyscraper topped with the IGBE logo, principals <PERSON> William </PERSON> and <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Alderdice </PERSON> reportedly made $ 75 million on fraudulent sales of gold, silver and platinum to 13,000 investors, many reassured by IGBE ads in the Wall Street Journal. Some IGBE salesmen earned $ 8,000 a week and the Alderdices were known to toss $ 100 bills from their stretch limousine and watch folks scramble for the cash. <PERSON> Neal </PERSON>'s successful prosecution of IGBE in 1985 was the first major boiler room case in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> and is credited with beginning the crackdown that drove many to <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Alderdice </PERSON> was hacked to death by his chauffeur before the trial began and his brother received a 10-year federal and a six-year state sentence. `` We are an equal opportunity agency. We prosecute anyone. We have doctors, lawyers and Indian chiefs,'' <PERSON> Neal </PERSON> said, pointing to a photo of <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Kabrahrah </PERSON>, a former Comanche tribal leader who became involved in a $ 40 million scam to sell rights to non-producing natural gas wells in <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION>. And the victims _ known as mooches or mullets in boiler-room parlance _ are just as varied. `` It's no longer just the retirees getting burned. Yuppies with money to spend are becoming the new targets,'' said <PERSON> Neal </PERSON>. Some emerging scams include bogus job search agencies, travel club rip-offs and touting low-priced `` penny'' stocks, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Against </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fraud </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> in </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telemarketing </ORGANIZATION>, a watchdog group. <PERSON> Neal </PERSON> has also noticed organized crime taking an interest in boiler rooms. In April, the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> charged the nation's largest penny stock dealer, <ORGANIZATION> Stuart-James </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. Inc. of <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>, with defrauding clients at its <LOCATION> Boca </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Raton </LOCATION> office by making exaggerated claims about companies `` A good boiler room salesman is like a chameleon,'' said <PERSON> Neal </PERSON>. `` If you are religious, suddenly they are born-again. If you have kids, they are suddenly the concerned parent. They tell you what you want to hear.'' In <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, scams involving vitamins and prize contests are hot, say investigators. The boiler rooms hook customers with a postcard saying they have won a valuable prize _ sometimes cash, a car or jewelry. The catch is that the customers must also purchase a supply of vitamins or some other item. Often the vitamins or prize are never delivered or they are grossly inferior to the product described by the `` yaks,'' or boiler room salesmen. Yet local agencies are often slow to crack down, said <PERSON> Katz </PERSON>. `` The cops here are dealing with drug traffic, gang violence and all sorts of other things,'' said <PERSON> Katz </PERSON>, whose office has prosecuted 300 people since 1986. Some areas, such as <LOCATION> Clark </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nev. </LOCATION>, have discouraged boiler rooms by requiring costly bonds for each company and every employee of a telemarking firm. <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> began registration of telemarketing firms in January 1987, and operators face a maximum penalty of one year in prison and a $ 10,000 fine for failing to comply. <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> adopted tough boiler-room laws in October 1986, including making schemes involving more than $ 50,000 in losses a first-degree felony punishable by up to 30 years in prison. In 1987, <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Fox </PERSON> was convicted of swindling $ 11 million from 4,000 investors in his <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Precious </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Metals </ORGANIZATION> firm and was sentenced to 585 years in prison, believed to be the longest white-collar crime sentence. <PERSON> Neal </PERSON> has one letter he ca n't forget. It came in early 1987 from <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaminsky </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Hazleton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, who lost $ 70,000 in mostly borrowed money in the United Precious Metals scam. `` I feel foolish and unable to make decisions. I always feel as though I will make another devastating mistake,'' wrote <PERSON> Kaminsky </PERSON>. `` These letters tear me up,'' said <PERSON> Neal </PERSON>. `` When a guy robs you on the street at least he is up front and only takes what is in your pocket. With telemarketing scams, they do n't just take what's in your pocket, but everything else you own. You can make more money, but it's the emotional impact you may never recover from.''

<HEAD>Mobil, Union Agree on Withdrawal Terms, Union Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Mobil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industrial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> reached an agreement Tuesday on most elements of the oil concern's withdrawal from <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, the union announced. Two issues remain to be worked out in meetings next month, but otherwise the union won most of its demands, the group said in a statement. <ORGANIZATION> Mobil </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> said the company would not comment on any possible accord. <ORGANIZATION> Mobil </ORGANIZATION> announced on April 28 that it was withdrawing from the racially divided nation and selling holdings once valued at $ 400 million to <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mining </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>, a South African conglomerate, for more than $ 155 million in cash and $ 10 million that was expected to be the operation's 1989 profit The company, which blamed <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> foreign policy for forcing the pullout, said it would record a net book loss of $ 140 million on the sale after adjustments for taxes and accounting. The chemical workers' union threatened to strike, accusing <ORGANIZATION> Mobil </ORGANIZATION> of lying about its intentions to leave and demanding a series of concessions. The union represents 1,200 of <ORGANIZATION> Mobil </ORGANIZATION>'s 1,500 black workers. Tuesday's agreement honors labor contracts and provides job security with the new owner as well as details of the disinvestment, the union said. The `` one vital piece of information'' still to be provided, the union said, was whether <ORGANIZATION> Mobil </ORGANIZATION> would continue to supply crude oil to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> after <ORGANIZATION> Gencor </ORGANIZATION>'s subsidiary, Trek, takes over <ORGANIZATION> Mobil </ORGANIZATION>'s assets June 30 <ORGANIZATION> Mobil </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Murray </PERSON> said in April that <ORGANIZATION> Mobil </ORGANIZATION> would not export crude or products to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. The union said this and details of a trust fund would be negotiated with a senior <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> representative from <ORGANIZATION> Mobil </ORGANIZATION> next month. `` The union regards the progress made so far as a major advance in its campaign for a fair disinvestment procedure. There is still a considerable way to go but within the constraints of <ORGANIZATION> Mobil </ORGANIZATION>'s failure to give notice ... progress has been made,'' the union statement said. <ORGANIZATION> Mobil </ORGANIZATION> had operated in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> for 90 years and was the largest <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> company doing business there, with almost 2,800 employees. Its decision to withdraw followed months of denials that it would follow <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, who left in 1986, and about 170 other American companies in bowing to pressure to disinvest in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> because of the country's apartheid racial policy. Some major oil exporters claim to observe an embargo on doing business in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, but the absence of any petroleum shortages has raised questions about whether and how their products are funneled into the country. Militant black unions joined other anti-apartheid groups in demanding sanctions and disinvestment by foreign companies during widespread political unrest in 1985 and 1986, but since then have cooled their public rhetoric on the subject. Critics of the union position say the pullouts by major firms hurt black workers as well as hardening the attitudes of whites. <ORGANIZATION> Mobil </ORGANIZATION> said earlier that all contract and equal employment policies would remain in effect under the new owners and the company would continue until at least 1994 to fund a foundation that supports various social programs in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>.

 Mongolian cashmere sweaters hang from <ORGANIZATION> Bloomingdale </ORGANIZATION>'s racks, and <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> still hopes to sell <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> its locomotives, but the $ 14 billion trade relationship between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> has been damaged after years of patient nurturing. In the wake of the <LOCATION> Tiananmen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION> massacre and subsequent string of executions, experts point to pockets of vulnerability among <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> companies working with <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> as well as a decline in Chinese imports. `` It wo n't be because Americans do n't want to buy, but delivery and reliability will be perceived widely as going down, and that will affect orders irrespective of whether it's true,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lampton </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> States-China </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> had replaced other Pacific Rim nations as a low-cost producer of everything from clothing to luggage to tents while steadily improving productivity and quality as workers became more motivated. `` The problem is going to be whether the work force will continue to be as productive,'' <PERSON> Lampton </PERSON> said, as Chinese workers and managers become more fearful of associating with foreigners. `` Communications are snarled, we do n't know if longshoremen will load ships on time,'' and American importers just may not want to deal with those uncertainties, he noted. Without Chinese imports, Americans would pay more for <ORGANIZATION> Nike </ORGANIZATION> running shoes, silk blouses and painted porcelain bowls. Experts say toy and game importers, who already are stocking up ahead of the Christmas shopping season, are scrambling to line up suppliers in other low-cost nations like <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. Last year <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> exported $ 1.17 billion worth of toys and games to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. On the flip side, <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> farmers would take a beating if their exports were curtailed. Last year they shipped to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> about $ 700 million in wheat, the largest <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> export to the People's Republic, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. Computer makers could lose a $ 150 million-plus outlet for their goods. Military suppliers already are bearing the brunt of a presidential decree prohibiting further sales to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Grumman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> said earlier this month it would eliminate 250 jobs associated with a $ 500 million <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> contract to develop and modernize a weapons control system for Chinese fighters. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> companies that sell products like power-generating equipment to the Chinese goverment could face trouble because <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> `` is going to have a foreign exchange shortage,'' said <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S.-China </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>. `` They've taken a big hit on their balance of payments. They ca n't buy what they thought they would buy, and they're going to have to cut imports,'' he said. Roughly 80 percent of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> companies' investment in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> lies in industries that manufacture goods for the domestic market, <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> said. Plans for expanding those operations are evaporating rapidly. But most <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> businesses are not likely to suffer substantially. While they have committed $ 3.4 billion to joint ventures in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, each firm's individual exposure is limited. <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, for example, sold $ 500 million of locomotives, aircraft engines and medical systems to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> over the last five years, but the number pales in comparison with <ORGANIZATION> GE </ORGANIZATION>'s annual revenue of $ 50 billion. And <ORGANIZATION> Ball </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, a $ 1.1 billion <LOCATION> Muncie </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ind. </LOCATION>, container maker, has spent just $ 2 million since 1987 on its joint container-making venture in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. `` From our perspective, it's a very small percentage of sales,'' said <PERSON> Ball </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Brad </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilks </PERSON>. Still, companies do not want to mothball their <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> operations. `` It's clearly not because of the money,'' <PERSON> Sullian </PERSON> said. `` It's the effort. They've spent five or six years building'' a relationship. For businesses, the attraction is formidable: <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> looms as the fastest growing economy in the world with a gross national product that has mushroomed at more than 10 percent a year. As a market for consumer goods, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> is virtually untapped. The nation's 1.1 billion population is a solid reason `` companies are reluctant to just bag it. You ca n't just write off 25 perent of the globe,'' one <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> watcher said. While most <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> companies are taking a wait-and-see approach, a few have found opportunity in the crisis. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamash </PERSON>, president of the New York-based trading company <ORGANIZATION> Shamash </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sons </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, said he has been snapping up Chinese-made products ranging from silks to nails. Now that <PERSON> Shamash </PERSON>'s competitors are skittish about buying, prices of Chinese-made goods are lower and the goods are more abundant. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> said some American staff of the 175 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> companies operating out of the Chinese capital are returning despite a travel advisory and the embassy's counsel against it. The Chinese government is pulling out all the stops to lure businessmen back, even as it simultaneously wages a media campaign against the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government for alleged interference. American companies are being bombarded with long-sought concessions from the Chinese government and atypical promises of prompt payment. Government-owned Noble Tower, a modern <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> building that houses foreign companies, sent faxes to every tenant `` asking them to come back and that everything is peaceful,'' said one American tenant. But businesses are wary that they may become pawns in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s powerful propaganda game `` We do n't want to be in a position where we're manipulated and paraded in front of cameramen,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Ball </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Wilks </PERSON>.

 Stock prices moved higher today, rebounding from a round of selling Monday as interest rates declined in the bond market. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was up 21.62 to 2,533.00 at 3 p.m. on Wall Street. Gainers outnumbered losers by almost 2 to 1 in nationwide trading of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> Exchange-listed stocks, with 934 up, 506 down and 516 unchanged. Volume on the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> totaled 143.09 million shares with one hour to go. Traders said the gains indicated the impact of Monday's more than 20-point decline in the Dow industrials had waned. Many traders cashed in profits Monday after the market rallied last week, pushing the Dow industrials up more than 45 points. Declining interest rates in the bond market helped propel stocks higher, analysts said.

<HEAD>Wheat Leads Rise In Crop Futures, Soviet Buying Cited</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The wheat market led grain and soybean futures prices to a sharply higher close Tuesday on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>, reflecting ideas that the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> is seeking to buy more <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> wheat. The rally drove wheat futures to their highest level since mid-May and erased most of Monday's steep losses in the corn, soybean and oat markets. Unlike the other grains, wheat futures had risen Monday on signs that the Soviets had bought up to 500,000 metric tons of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> wheat at market prices, an indication that they had an immediate need for the grain. Tuesday's rally was fueled by speculation that the Soviets would be back for more wheat and by reports of rain-induced harvest delays in the central and southern states where soft red winter wheat _ the variety reportedly sought by the Soviets _ is grown. `` There are also a lot of quality concerns in the soft red wheat, which makes large-scale buying particularly bullish,'' said <PERSON> Katharina </PERSON> <PERSON> Zimmer </PERSON>, a grain-market analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Capital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Markets </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. At the close of trading, wheat was -LCB- cent to 10 \ cents higher with the contract for delivery in July at $ 4.12 a bushel; corn was 3 -LCB- cents to 4 -RCB- cents higher with July at $ 2.62 -LCB- a bushel; oats were 4 -RCB- cents to 5 -LCB- cents higher with July at $ 1.53 -LCB- a bushel; soybeans were 4 cents to 13 -LCB- cents higher with July at $ 7.40 a bushel

<HEAD>Six-Year-Old Airline Typifies Success</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By INGER SANDAL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TEMPE, Ariz. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Thirty years ago, <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Beauvais </PERSON> left an accounting job at a steel company for one in the airline industry that offered $ 15 more a month. Today, he operates the nation's 10th-largest airline <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> is a prototype of successful companies in the 1980s _ slick, opportunistic, oriented to employees' needs. A child of deregulation, the 6-year-old airline made $ 10 million last quarter while some other carriers waded in red ink. It projects a $ 30 million profit this year. While metal fatigue made headlines last year in the wake of fatal accidents, <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> fielded a fleet of 74 aircraft, mostly <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 737s and 757s, averaging only 5.6 years old. `` We have a very good market niche ... and we've always been adequately financed and our people are extremely productive,'' <PERSON> Beauvais </PERSON> says. `` You have to have all these elements in place or you can not deal with the significantly competitive atmosphere that we have.'' <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> recently failed in its most ambitious undertaking _ an attempt to buy <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>' Northeast shuttle out from under developer <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> _ despite offering $ 50 million more than <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>. But <PERSON> Beauvais </PERSON>, the 52-year-old chairman and chief executive whose swashbuckling image is stamped on his airline, did n't get where he is by putting his eggs in one basket. <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> has applied for federal approval to start flights to <LOCATION> Sydney </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> and is constantly on the lookout for opportunities to expand into other markets. <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> succeeds primarily because of strong leadership, said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Carey </PERSON>, a senior vice president with <ORGANIZATION> Airline </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, which publishes Airline Quarterly in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. `` They have proven to be able to make adjustments to their operating strategies as the marketplace requires,'' <PERSON> Carey </PERSON> said. `` I do like the fundamentals of the company,'' said <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Karos </PERSON>, a financial airline analyst for <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` They clearly are well into a turnaround.'' For its first five years, <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> averaged about 65 percent annual growth in carrying capacity but lost money in all but one year, <PERSON> Karos </PERSON> said. In 1988, he said, the company began to slow its growth in seat-miles to focus on profitability. It posted a profit in the second quarter of 1988 and has been profitable each quarter since then. `` They changed their operating strategy,'' <PERSON> Carey </PERSON> said. `` They actually changed from their emphasis on long-haul operations and re-emphasized the feeder services through <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION> and have improved their profitability because of that revenue growth.'' <PERSON> Carey </PERSON> said trans-Pacific air service is growing at a higher rate than travel to <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and is almost triple domestic growth. <PERSON> Beauvais </PERSON> said <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> was serious about buying the shuttle but ran out of time to come up with the financing. The airline is going ahead with expansion of service to the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> through <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> National </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> LaGuardia </LOCATION> via landing slots acquired in May. America West needs approval from the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> and the Japanese government before it can start service to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>. Deregulation provided opportunity but also unprecedented competition, and most of the new entrants failed. `` There's not many survivors,'' <PERSON> Beauvais </PERSON> said. He is one of them. The <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> native entered the industry in 1960 as an accountant for <ORGANIZATION> Frontier </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> and moved through jobs in <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. In 1981, while in <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION> for a second time, he linked up with current company president <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Conway </PERSON>, who had quit as a vice president of <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>. By 1983, <PERSON> Beauvais </PERSON>, <PERSON> Conway </PERSON> and five others had raised $ 20 million through public stock offerings and bank financing and were ready to fly. The company started service Aug. 1 of that year with 280 employees and three <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 737s, serving four points between <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo </LOCATION>.; today, <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> has 8,800 employees and serves 47 cities. <PERSON> Beauvais </PERSON> said he chose the <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION> area because no carrier dominated the region. `` Other airlines failed to see the opportunity,'' he said. `` The timing was right to build a hub-and-spoke system.'' Two constants of the airline's history have been its original marketing slogan _ `` Less Fare, <ORGANIZATION> More </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Care </ORGANIZATION>'' _ and management's willingness to bend over backward to keep its employees from union afflilation <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> offered `` more care'' through assigned seating, complimentary beverages and free copies of the <ORGANIZATION> Wall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Street </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION> and USA Today. After some complaints about late flights, the carrier recovered and ranks first in on-time operations for the period since the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> began keeping figures in 1987. <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> employees are stockholders who participate in a profit-sharing program. Employees move around, working as a flight attendant one day and taking reservations or doing ramp duties the next. `` It's helped <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> be extremely productive and given individuals very good professional atmosphere,'' <PERSON> Beauvais </PERSON> said. The practices apparently convinced employees to reject two unions in elections this year and keep their airline the nation's largest without any unionized employees. <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> is largely non-unionized but has a weak flight attendants' union. <PERSON> Beauvais </PERSON>' second-floor office is directly beneath the flight paths into and out of <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sky </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>, allowing the chief executive officer the opportunity to watch his planes land and take off. `` I do n't regret a moment of it,'' he said. `` I'd never work in any other industry.''

<HEAD>May Department Stores Considers Sale of Discounters</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ST. LOUIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 May <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. Tuesday said it is exploring the possibility of selling its <ORGANIZATION> Caldor </ORGANIZATION> and Venture discount chains Divesting the two general merchandise discounters would enable the retailer to more easily pursue its intention to concentrate on its department store and shoe businesses. `` The divestiture of <ORGANIZATION> Caldor </ORGANIZATION> and Venture will allow May to focus on the operations and expansion of our higher-return and faster-growing businesses ...'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Farrell </PERSON>, May chairman and chief executive officer. May, one of the largest retailers in the country and owner of <ORGANIZATION> Lord </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>, <PERSON> Hecht </PERSON>'s, <PERSON> Sibley </PERSON>'s, plus other department stores and specialty shoe chains, said it anticipates using a significant portion of the proceeds from a possible sale to buy back its stock. The remainder of any proceeds would be spent on general corporate purposes, including investment in the department store operations and shoe businesses, the company said in a news release. May management have been working to restore <ORGANIZATION> Caldor </ORGANIZATION> to higher levels of profitability and recently have expressed optimism about <ORGANIZATION> Caldor </ORGANIZATION>'s prospects. <ORGANIZATION> Caldor </ORGANIZATION>, which operates in the Northeast, was taken over by May in 1986 as part of the acquisition of <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Goods </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Caldor </ORGANIZATION>'s operating earnings came to $ 50 million in 1988 on sales of $ 1.6 billion May launched Venture in 1970. It operates in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> and last year had operating income of $ 81 million on sales of $ 1.3 billion. Both Venture and May sell a range of items including hard line goods, such as appliances, and soft line goods, such as clothing. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hays </PERSON>, May's president, described <ORGANIZATION> Caldor </ORGANIZATION> and Venture as two `` well-positioned businesses with excellent management and committed associates.'' As a condition of any sale, May will insist on provisions regarding jobs, compensation and benefits for <ORGANIZATION> Caldor </ORGANIZATION>'s and Venture's employees Retail industry analysts had been expecting that May eventually would shed <ORGANIZATION> Caldor </ORGANIZATION> and Venture. `` I think it was something we were all expecting them to do,'' said <PERSON> Jeffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Edelman </PERSON>, of <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` But it is a little earlier than expected.'' <PERSON> Edelman </PERSON> said he thought May would have waited to look for buyers until <ORGANIZATION> Caldor </ORGANIZATION> and Venture had shown steady financial progress over a longer period of time. Given May's plan to use much of the money it would get from selling the two units to buy its shares, the move seems aimed chiefly at enhancing the value of the retailer's stock. Some shareholders had become disgruntled when May diluted its earnings through the acquisitions of the <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Goods </ORGANIZATION> properties in 1986 and then the <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>'s and <ORGANIZATION> Filene </ORGANIZATION>'s department store chains in 1988. `` I think it's an attractive move for them to make as far as shareholders are concerned,'' said <PERSON> Edelman </PERSON>. <PERSON> Farrell </PERSON> said May has asked the investment banking firm <ORGANIZATION> Morgan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stanley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. Inc. to look into the move With the addition of <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>'s and <PERSON> Filene </PERSON>'s last year, May's 14 department store divisions produced sales of $ 7.5 billion and operating earnings of $ 802 million. Volume Shoe's sales were $ 1.1 billion with operating earnings of $ 138 million. May, which is based in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>, currently operates 283 department stores in 29 states and the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>, 120 <ORGANIZATION> Caldor </ORGANIZATION> stores in eight states in the <LOCATION> Northeast </LOCATION>, 73 Venture stores in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> and 2,628 Volume Shoe stores in 43 states and the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>.

 Sustaining success has been difficult for <ORGANIZATION> Eastman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> this decade and that's one reason the company's name keeps coming up on <LOCATION> Wall </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Street </LOCATION> as a possible takeover target The company has managed to turn around a sagging bottom line twice since 1980, only to see the same problems _ increased competition, a rising <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar and higher costs _ return to chew up profits. `` It seems like they wipe their brow and say, ` Whew, we're glad that's over,' and they turn around and have to do it all over again,'' said <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Obenzinger </PERSON>, a stock analyst for <ORGANIZATION> Wood </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gundy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Call it the three-year twitch. <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION> laid off thousands of workers in 1983 saying unfavorable exchange rates and soft markets overseas had hurt its business. The company's profits went up 63 percent the next year. In 1986, the company had to lay off more than 10,000 workers, radically restructure the company and start a cost-cutting program in an effort to remain competitive. Profits more than tripled the next year and set a record in 1988. Now in 1989, after profits declined 23 percent in the first quarter of the year, the company has announced plans to cut costs by consolidating its photofinishing and consumer photography units, which could mean hundreds of layoffs. `` It does seem to go in cycles and we're at the point where the company is under pressure again,'' said <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> Glazer </PERSON>, a stock analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Dean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Witter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reynolds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. Meanwhile, <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION> is having trouble controlling expenses at <ORGANIZATION> Sterling </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, which it bought for $ 5.1 billion last year. And the company is battling in court to prevent a large damage award to <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> in the two companies' patent infringement lawsuit over instant photography. As if all these problems-that-won ` t-go-away are n't enough, <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION> was named last month as the 1 emitter of the industrial pollutant methylene chloride by a Washington-based environmental group. Analysts point to several reasons for <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION>'s roller-coaster ride through the'80s. First and foremost is the value of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar. When the dollar is strong compared to other countries' currencies, <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION> gets hurt in two ways: its profits overseas are smaller when translated back into dollars, and foreign rivals gain a price advantage in sales to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> market This double whammy hurt <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION> throughout the first half of the decade and helped competitors like <ORGANIZATION> Fuji </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Photo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Film </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Agfa-Gevaert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> loosen <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION>'s strangle hold on photographic film sales around the world. In the 1970s, <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION> sold between 90 and 95 percent of all photographic film in the world. Today, that has fallen to between 80 and 85 percent, according to industry estimates. The dollar has been gaining strength for the past year and, unless it weakens soon, <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION> is going to have to continue cutting costs to offset the losses it will bring. `` I'm not sounding alarm right now on the dollar, but I'm getting ready to,'' <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION>'s Chairman <PERSON> Colby </PERSON> <PERSON> Chandler </PERSON> said. `` If it has n't started down by year-end, I'm going to be concerned. <PERSON> Chandler </PERSON> said it's difficult to determine how much of <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION>'s woes can be traced to outside factors like the dollar or to management decisions made by <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION> executives `` <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> basically has sort of a chip on its shoulder these days. We're always trying to find who's to blame for something,'' <PERSON> Chandler </PERSON> said. `` Instead of taking responsibility, we have learned to blame everyone else but ourselves for what goes wrong.'' He said he does n't want <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION> to join that chorus. In an effort to become more in control, <PERSON> Chandler </PERSON> said the company is planning to sell a number of its businesses that have either been developed within the company or been acquired. `` Each one will not make a significant impact on the company or the public eye, they're not that big. But the idea is very powerful inside the company,'' <PERSON> Chandler </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION> remains a benevolent corporate father figure to the <LOCATION> Rochester </LOCATION> area, where it remains the largest employer, said <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Enderlin </PERSON>, an analyst for <ORGANIZATION> Smith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Barney </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Harris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Upham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> `` Their idea of dramatic cost-cutting and dramatic restructuring really is n't that dramatic,'' <PERSON> Enderlin </PERSON> said. `` They still have a mentality that is somewhat paternalistic.'' Questions about <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION> being too nice only pump up the takeover talk on Wall Street. Rumors have swirled in the past few weeks speculating that corporate raider <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> has begun looking at the company and that <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION> might be considering a merger with <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. With takeovers sweeping corporate <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, stock analysts are n't surprised that <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION>'s name has popped up on the merger and acquisitions menu, but most agree a takeover of the company is `` These rumors get started because the company has characteristics that attract corporate raiders, but the odds are against a takeover attempt,'' said <PERSON> Glazer </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION> is a well-known name, it's in a good industry and it's being managed for long-term growth, three things that appeal to corporate raiders who want companies that can be changed around to yield more money right away `` I guess there are some people who believe that some outside group can wave a magic wand and change <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION> from an ugly duckling into a beautiful swan,'' said <PERSON> Enderlin </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Smith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Barney </ORGANIZATION>. `` It's not that easy.'' <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION>'s businesses are complex. The company also has a number of hurdles that give it some protection from potential hostile takeovers. The company is incorporated in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, which has tough anti-takeover laws. If a raider acquired a majority of <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION> stock, management could issue enough new stock to friendly buyers to outvote the raider. The company also has about $ 13 billion in long - and short-term debt, which would increase the cost of a leveraged buyout `` Nothing's impossible, but a takeover attempt would be hard to believe,'' said <PERSON> Obenzinger </PERSON>.

 Stock prices rose today on the strength of declining interest rates and rising oil stocks. The market gave up some ground late in the session but still managed to rebound somewhat from Monday's decline, when many traders cashed in gains made during last week's rally. Declining interest rates in the bond market helped propel stocks higher, analysts said. Lower interest rates improve the outlook for corporate profits. Analysts also attributed today's gains to institutions attempting to complete their second-quarter trading ahead of the July 4 holiday weekend to prepare midyear portfolio reports for clients. The stock market advanced last week to new post-crash highs amid gathering signs of a slowing economy, which were seen as indicators that inflation would not accelerate. Oil company stocks rose broadly because of a rise in crude oil prices, traders said. Airline stocks also generally were higher.

 <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s stock jumped higher Tuesday, fueled by a report that a group led by <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> billionaire <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bass </PERSON> had acquired up to 3 percent of the company, which owns <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>. Bass spokeswoman <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Hawkins </PERSON> declined comment on the report in <LOCATION> USA </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Today </LOCATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Hopkins </PERSON> said the company would not comment on the stock activity. In <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> trading, <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> rose $ 6.75 to $ 146 a share. The jump followed gains of $ 1.75 on Monday and $ 15.50 for all of last week. Analysts said speculators have taken an intense interest in airline companies following an international investor group's deal last week to buy <ORGANIZATION> NWA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, the parent of <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, in a deal valued at $ 3.64 billion. The airline industry's strongest performers _ including American, <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> USAir </ORGANIZATION> _ may have much higher value than their stock prices indicate, said analyst <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Marckesano </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Janney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Montgomery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Scott </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>. `` I think the Northwest bidding and the subsequent publicity has kind of highlighted the potential value of the four or five strong majors, the ones who are strong and prosperous and have been that way for years,'' <PERSON> Marckesano </PERSON> said. `` The mentality seems to be that if <ORGANIZATION> NWA </ORGANIZATION> can be taken over, why ca n't anybody else?'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Decker </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Duff </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Phelps </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. United is the nation's second-largest airline after American in terms of paid passenger miles. <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> owns 80 percent of its 408-jet fleet, the highest percentage among the major carriers and one of the factors that could enhance its appeal to suitors, analysts said. A buyer could conceivably sell the owned aircraft and use the money to pay off debt from the acquisition and lease other aircraft. United also has a large route network in the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION>, the world's fastest-growing air-travel region <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> is the successor to <ORGANIZATION> Allegis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which formerly owned the airline, the <ORGANIZATION> Hertz </ORGANIZATION> car rental company and the <ORGANIZATION> Westin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Hilton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> hotel chains. <PERSON> Allegis </PERSON> embarked on a major restructuring in 1987, after the investor group <ORGANIZATION> Coniston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partners </ORGANIZATION> acquired a 13 percent stake and threatened to mount a takeover of the board of directors to force a breakup of the company. <ORGANIZATION> Coniston </ORGANIZATION> contended that the stock market would value <ORGANIZATION> Allegis </ORGANIZATION> more highly if it dumped its non-airline businesses. <ORGANIZATION> Allegis </ORGANIZATION> sold its non-airline companies and renamed itself <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION>, which was its title before it acquired those businesses and renamed itself <ORGANIZATION> Allegis </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>Wall Sees More Initial Spending If Congress Restricts New Agency's
Power</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration will be forced to double its initial spending on savings and loan rescues if <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> restricts the financial power of the new <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; L bailout agency, thrift regulator <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Danny </PERSON> <PERSON> Wall </PERSON> said Tuesday. If a congressional conference committee next month adopts the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> version of the S & amp; L bill, <PERSON> Wall </PERSON> said the new agency, called the <ORGANIZATION> Resolution </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, would need to spend at least twice the $ 50 billion it is due to receive over the next three years. The House bill, unlike the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> version, forbids the bailout agency from issuing promissory notes or loss guarantees extending its liability beyond the $ 50 billion. Wall, speaking at a conference of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> of Saving Institutions, the industry's largest trade group, said $ 50 billion represents the net cost of closing and merging insolvent thrifts. It reflects the cost after the government recovers some of its expenses by selling real estate inherited from failed S & amp; Ls, he said. Unless the agency can rescue institutions by issuing promissory notes and paying them off years later after the government sells the real estate, the initial cash outlay needed will be at least $ 100 billion, he said. In that case, President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> would be forced to ask <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in several years for more money. Rep. <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, insisted on the restriction, arguing that Wall's agency, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, abused its note-writing powers last year and, in effect, spent money without congressional approval. He has said he wants to ensure the <ORGANIZATION> Resolution </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which will take over some of the bank board's duties, will not have similar leeway. Wall also complained about another provision in the House bill that makes the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deposit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> the primary regulator of state-chartered S & amp; Ls, taking away that power from the agency that will succeed the bank board. Wall's agency, under the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> version, retains its power over both state and federal S & amp; Ls. <PERSON> Wall </PERSON> said that would create conflicts of interest in the future because the <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION>, as the insuror of S & amp; L deposits, likely will become part-owner of rescued institutions. The <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION> should not regulate institutions it owns while at the same time regulating privately owned competing institutions, he said. On another topic, <PERSON> Wall </PERSON> said both the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; L bills do not give his agency and the <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION> enough power to allow capital-deficient savings and loans to continue operating. <PERSON> Wall </PERSON> said that even advocates of very tough capital rules believe regulators ought to have the leeway to allow undercapitalized <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Ls to continue operating provided they are profitable, have competent managers and stick to a plan to increase their capital. However, a recent review by bank board lawyers indicates that regulators do not have enough authority to grant that leeway. `` There's too much pressure to say no and not enough ability to say yes,'' he said.

 The dollar drifted lower Tuesday against all major currencies except the Japanese yen in thin, choppy trading. Gold prices rose. <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> quoted a troy ounce of gold at $ 375.25 as of 4 p.m. EDT, up $ 1.25 from late Monday. Currency dealers said sentiment toward the dollar remains bullish but that many traders were reluctant to buy the currency prior to the Independence Day holiday and in the absence of any market-moving news. `` There's a real sense in the market that this lull is a welcome respite after what we've experienced in the last couple of weeks,'' said <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON>, a vice president at <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Capital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Markets </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>. The dollar has risen sharply in recent weeks, then fell back last week amid concern that central banks will intervene to thwart its rise and over worries of higher interest rates overseas. The dollar came under pressure abroad Tuesday on a report that the West German <ORGANIZATION> Bundesbank </ORGANIZATION> might consider an interest-rate hike at a meeting Thursday of its central-bank council. The battered British pound, meanwhile, gained ground against the dollar, helped by a surprising narrowing in the British trade deficit in May and news that Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> agreed with other European leaders on plans toward monetary union. At least two rounds of intervention by the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> England </ORGANIZATION> also encouraged the pound's recovery. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, the pound cost $ 1.5640, more expensive than $ 1.5450 late Monday. Sterling bought $ 1.5660 later in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, up from $ 1.5450. In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, where trading ends before <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s business day begins, the dollar rose 1.05 yen to a closing 141.23 yen. It was quoted lower at 141.07 yen in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, and at 141.75 yen in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, up from 141.10 yen late Monday. Traders said the yen was hurt by reports in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> that <LOCATION> Japanese </LOCATION> Prime Minister <PERSON> Sousuke </PERSON> <PERSON> Uno </PERSON> was prepared to resign due to allegations that he hired a geisha as a mistress. Other late dollar rates in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, compared with late Monday, included: 1.9560 West German marks, down from 1.9590; 1.6850 Swiss francs, down from 1.6882; 1.1937 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1940; 6.6395 French francs, down from 6.6480; and 1,414.87 Italian lire, down from 1,416.00. Late dollar rates in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, compared with late Monday, included: 1.9550 West German marks, down from 1.9552; 1.6845 Swiss francs, up from 1.6840; 6.6335 French francs, down from 6.6380; 2.2010 Dutch guilders, up from 2.2003; 1,408.50 Italian lire, down from 1,414.00; and 1.1939 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1940. On the Commodity Exchange in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, gold bullion for current delivery closed at $ 376.60 a troy ounce, up $ 1.50 from Monday's late bid. Gold rose in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> to a late bid price of $ 376.75 a troy ounce, up from late Monday's $ 375.25. In <LOCATION> Zurich </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>, gold rose to $ 375.75 an ounce from $ 374.25 late Monday. Earlier, in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, gold fell $ 1.15 to close at $ 375.11 an ounce. Silver prices were unchanged. On <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s Comex, silver bullion for current delivery settled at $ 5.306 a troy ounce, the same as late Monday. Silver closed in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> at $ 5.33 an ounce, also unchanged from Monday.

 Stock prices rose Tuesday on the strength of declining interest rates and rising oil company shares. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which declined 20.49 points Monday, finished up 14.99 at 2,526.37. Advancing issues outpaced decliners by about 9 to 5 in nationwide trading of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> Exchange-listed stocks, with 916 up, 546 down and 504 unchanged. <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> volume totaled 171.09 million shares, up from 143.60 million in the previous session. The market gave up some ground late in the session but still managed to rebound somewhat from Monday, when some traders were cashing in gains made during last week's strong rally. Declining interest rates in the bond market _ where prices rose by nearly $ 10 per $ 1,000 in face value on the benchmark 30-year <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bond _ helped propel stocks higher, analysts said. Lower interest rates improve the outlook for corporate profits. `` We're back to the same old lockstep environment,'' said <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Barry </PERSON>, director of research at <ORGANIZATION> Fahnestock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> `` The dollar _ the flight to safety worldwide _ is taking bonds up and lower interest rates are taking stocks up.'' The stock market advanced last week to new post-crash highs amid gathering signs of a slowing economy, which were seen as indicators that inflation and would not accelerate and interest rates would be stable or lower.

<HEAD>Wheat Futures Surge With Hopes For Soviet Buying</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 Wheat futures prices bounded to a six-week high Tuesday on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> in anticipation of further buying of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> wheat by the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, which apparently is strapped for supplies. On other markets, livestock and meat futures were mostly lower while oil and precious-metals futures were mixed. Wheat settled -LCB- cent to 10 -RCB- cents higher with the contract for delivery in July at $ 4.12 -LCB- a bushel; corn was 3 -RCB- cents to 5 cents higher with July at $ 2.62 -RCB- a bushel; oats were 4 -RCB- cents to 5 -LCB- cents higher with July at $ 1.53 -LCB- a bushel; soybeans were 8 cents to 13 cents higher with July at $ 7.38 -LCB- a bushel. The rally pushed wheat futures to their highest level since May 15 and erased most of Monday's steep losses in the corn, soybean and oat markets. Unlike the other grain markets, wheat futures had risen Monday on rumors the Soviets had bought up to 500,000 metric tons of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> wheat at market prices, an indication they had an immediate need for the grain. Most of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s recent purchases of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> grain have been through the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s Export Enhancement Program, which effectively subsidizes grain sales and requires buyers to submit bids in a process that is not always speedy. After the close of trading Tuesday, the <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> said private exporters had reported sales of 400,000 metric tons of soft red winter wheat to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> for delivery during the current marketing year, which began Oct. 1. Tuesday's rally was fueled by speculation that the Soviets would be back for more wheat and by reports of rain-induced harvest delays in the central and southern states where soft red winter wheat is grown. `` There are also a lot of quality concerns about the soft red wheat, which makes large-scale buying particularly bullish,'' said <PERSON> Katharina </PERSON> <PERSON> Zimmer </PERSON>, a grain-market analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Capital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Markets </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Livestock and meat futures settled mostly lower on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, reversing Monday's trend. The hog market led the way down, reflecting lower spot hog prices and perceptions that the market was nearing a top. Cattle futures were pressured by slack demand and ample supplies. Live cattle settled .35 cent lower to .07 cent higher with August at 70.57 cents a pound; feeder cattle were unchanged to .27 cent lower with August at 81.25 cents a pound; hogs were .20 cent to .87 cent lower with July at 49.10 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were .80 cent lower to .50 cent higher with July at 34.75 cents a pound. Heating-oil and crude-oil futures rose for the fifth straight day on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> but the gasoline market's rally ended with a modest decline. Analysts said the market's uncertain performance indicated that a downturn _ a so-called technical correction _ was likely. West Texas Intermediate crude settled 6 cents to 23 cents higher with August at $ 20.48 a barrel; heating oil was .35 cent to .88 cent higher with July at 50.53 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was .01 cent to .25 cent lower with July at 63.68 cents a gallon. Gold futures rose slightly while silver futures were nearly unchanged on <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, in quiet trading that reflected the dollar's mixed performance against other major currencies. Gold settled $ 1.50 higher across the board with August at $ 379.80 a troy ounce; silver was unchanged to 1 cent lower with July at $ 5.31 a troy ounce.

<HEAD>Stock Exchange Says Drexel Sanctions Decision Will Come After Settlement</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> is indicating the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> will take disciplinary measures against <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> for the firm's involvement in Wall Street corruption. However, an <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said Tuesday the exchange would wait for <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> to settle the sweeping criminal securities fraud case brought against it by the federal government before deciding what sanctions if any to impose on the investment firm. <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> agreed to plead guilty to six felonies and pay $ 650 million in penalties to settle its criminal case, which involved alleged securities law violations stemming from the insider trading scandals linked to now-jailed speculator <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON> <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Phelan </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> said in an interview with the Wall Street Journal that the settlement represents `` the biggest failure of the -LRB- supervisory -RRB- system in the history of the financial markets.'' <PERSON> Phelan </PERSON> did not specify what sanctions were being considered, but the exchange could fine, censure or suspend the firm and employees. Issues before the exchange include whether top <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> officials failed to supervise employees properly. `` The last thing we want to do is come out looking like a wimp,'' <PERSON> Phelan </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Phelan </PERSON> made comments last week that raised doubts about whether the <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION> would follow up on the federal sanctions being levied against <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> by the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. `` I'm not sure what purpose we would serve by adding any more to that since the commission could have done everything including bar -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- as a broker-dealer,'' he told a group of reporters. Exchange officials maintain <PERSON> Phelan </PERSON> was not indicating the exchange would not take action against <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION>. `` We have not yet determined what action if any the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> will take in the <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> case,'' spokesman <PERSON> Rich </PERSON> <PERSON> Torrenzano </PERSON> said. `` That determination will be made in the coming weeks and months once federal regulators have completed all of their deliberations and settlements.''

 Crude oil and wholesale heating oil futures continued to climb Tuesday, carried aloft largely by technical buying. Gasoline futures prices pulled back. On the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, the August contract for <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intermediate </ORGANIZATION> rose 23 cents to $ 20.48 per 42-gallon barrel. The contract closed with a gain of 54 cents on Monday. Contracts for later delivery of WTI, the benchmark grade of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> crude, posted similar increases. Among refined petroleum products traded on the exchange, the July contract for No. 2 heating oil gained 0.88 cent to settle at 50.53 cents a gallon, adding to Monday's gain of 0.16 cent Other contract months of heating oil also finished higher. The contact for July delivery of unleaded gasoline edged down by 0.01 cent to 63.68 a gallon after Monday's surge of 0.77 cent. Contracts for August, September and October gasoline delivery also declined. <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Haskins </PERSON>, a vice president at <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, said the rally in the crude futures pits was sustained with the help of technical buying. Buying bred more buying as traders pushed the price of crude futures past thresholds considered significant. `` The technicals have pointed upward now for a week and a half and until we get some dramatic bearish news the market will keep moving higher,'' said <PERSON> Haskins </PERSON>. `` The market looks like it wants to head to $ 21 or $ 21.20 -LRB- a barrel -RRB- in the near term.'' The market also has been getting a lift this week from news that some <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> members intend to curb crude production. Published reports have said <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Emirates </LOCATION>, two chronic overproducers, will reduce their output levels closer to the amount desired by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries. <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> previously had rejected its OPEC-imposed production ceiling and set its own quota. Both <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> UAE </ORGANIZATION> reportedly now plan to scale back production levels but keep them above the amount mandated by the oil cartel at a meeting in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>, earlier this month.

<HEAD>Time-Paramount Struggle Could Affect Future of Friendly Mergers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOYCE M. ROSENBERG</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Now that <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> has rejected a sweetened $ 12.2 billion takeover bid from <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, the focus of their struggle is shifting to <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION>, not only the fate of <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> but also the future of friendly mergers may be decided in court. Time is fighting to preserve a planned merger with <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> _ and it is that merger on which the takeover fight may turn. Paramount, after announcing its original $ 175-a-share, or $ 10.7 billion, bid on June 6, filed suit in <ORGANIZATION> Chancery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> to stop the transaction that would create <ORGANIZATION> Time-Warner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, the world's largest communications concern All three companies are incorporated in <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION>. Time and <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> first proposed their friendly stock-for-stock merger transaction in March. After Paramount began its pursuit of Time, the merger agreement was amended and <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> began a $ 14 billion tender offer for its would-be partner. Paramount contends Time opened up a <ORGANIZATION> Pandora </ORGANIZATION>'s box _ effectively putting itself up for sale _ by announcing it would merge with <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION>. Under <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> law, if a company has put itself up for sale, its board is required to seek the maximum value for shareholders. If the court rules that <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> in fact put itself up for sale, the company's board could be hard-pressed to reject <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION>'s $ 200-a-share bid, which is $ 74 higher than the price at which Time stock traded before Paramount announced its bid Time rejected Paramount's latest offer Monday, calling it financially inadequate and subject to too many conditions. Time contends that its merger plans with <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> did not put the company up for sale, meaning its board does not have to consider higher bids. A court hearing on the issue is scheduled for July 11. The case has generating much interest among companies and corporate lawyers because of the possibility it could set a precedent affecting mergers between other companies. Many <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> companies _ including about half of the Fortune 500 _ are incorporated in <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> to take advantage of state tax laws aimed at attracting business. As a result, business law decisions by the <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> courts _ which have established a strong reputation in dealing with corporate issues _ widely are seen as important precedents. <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> DeAngelo </PERSON>, a professor at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Michigan </ORGANIZATION>, said a ruling in <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION>'s favor could place a chill on friendly mergers such as the original <ORGANIZATION> Time-Warner </ORGANIZATION> deal in favor of cash buyouts. `` You would want to make sure, if you did n't want to be acquired, you were clearly the buyer'' in a deal, he said. But <PERSON> DeAngelo </PERSON> said a ruling favoring <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION> would not necessarily mean an end to mergers such as the <ORGANIZATION> Time-Warner </ORGANIZATION> deal, and predicted that corporate lawyers would find a way to structure mergers in accordance with such a ruling. `` You'll see a period of uncertainty and people will tread carefully as they get used to the new rules,'' he said. <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Margotta </PERSON>, a professor at <ORGANIZATION> Northeastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, said that even if the court rules in <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION>'s favor, a merger transaction structured differently from the <ORGANIZATION> Time-Warner </ORGANIZATION> proposal might not be affected. However, <PERSON> Margotta </PERSON> said, a ruling against <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> is `` going to make it much more difficult'' to accomplish a friendly stock-swap merger. Many observers decline to predict how the court might rule, but some believe the fight will come down to a question of money and <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION>'s $ 200-a-share bid. `` The legal issue is nothing more than a subterfuge for some basic economic conflicts,'' said <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Rappaport </PERSON>, a professor at <ORGANIZATION> Northwestern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Kellogg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Graduate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION>. Time stock has fluctuated since Paramount announced its bid, as traders try to forecast how the court might rule and how the struggle will end. On Tuesday, <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> stock slipped 75 cents to $ 163.25 a share in <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> composite trading. <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> was up 25 cents to $ 59.12 -LCB- a share, and Paramount was down 87 -LCB- cents to $ 60.37 -LCB- a share.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> denied a request to delay a new pricing scheme scheduled to go into effect July 1 for the nation's largest long-distance company, <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> T </ORGANIZATION>, the agency said Tuesday. The requests for a stay had been filed in June by the <ORGANIZATION> Puerto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rico </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telefonica </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Larga </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Distancia </ORGANIZATION>, which had said the new plan to place a `` cap'' on the prices <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telegraph </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> can charge would put the two companies at a competitive disadvantage. They also said the plan would harm the public interest. But the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION>, in a decision reached Friday and made public Tuesday, said the companies failed to provide adequate reasons for a stay and that the public would benefit from the new pricing. The so-called `` price cap'' plan, which the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> adopted in March after a two-year study, replaces a 20-year-old `` rate of return'' regulatory scheme that had placed limits on what <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T could earn above its costs. Most recently that limit was 12.2 percent. <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> Chew </PERSON> said the commission also was reviewing other petitions to suspend the price cap plan, so it was not immediately known if the plan would go into effect July 1. <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T spokesman <PERSON> Herb </PERSON> <PERSON> Linnen </PERSON> said the company was confident it would prevail. `` We expect price caps will go into effect July 1,'' <PERSON> Linnen </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T last month told the commission it would lower its prices by $ 140 million on July 1, through reductions is basic long-distance rates and its special Reach Out <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> calling plan. In its decision, the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> said `` Price cap regulation offers significant consumer benefits that do not exist under rate of return regulation. ... In light of the proposed decreases, we believe that the public interest weighs strongly in favor of proceeding with the implementation of our price cap rules.'' The price cap plan allows <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T, which in 1988 controlled 68 percent of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> long-distance market, to raise rates 3 percentage points less than the rate of inflation in three categories of service: residential and small business; 800 calls; and other business services, mainly for large customers. The <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> has said the plan is intended to give <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T an incentive to cut costs and that consumers could save $ 900 million in charges over four years. Under rate-of-return regulation, <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T's long-distance rates have dropped 38 percent since 1984. Much of that decrease, however, has resulted from higher prices consumers have been paying to connect to local telephone networks. With consumers paying more, long-distance companies have paid less to the local telephone networks, and the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> has forced <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T to pass those savings along to its long-distance customers. Puerto Rican Telephone argued that <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T will be able to apply the `` flow through'' savings to individual services in a way that would disadvantage competitors. The company also argued that the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> should consider price cap regulations for the local <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> operating companies at the same time it does for <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T. The <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> has proposed to impose price caps on the seven <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> companies beginning in July 1990. La <ORGANIZATION> Telefonica </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Larga </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Distancia </ORGANIZATION>, a Puerto Rican long-distance company, argued it would be harmed by the access charge provisions and that the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> should have imposed tighter limits on <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T price changes.
