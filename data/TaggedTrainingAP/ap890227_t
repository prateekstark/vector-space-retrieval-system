 The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judicial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conduct </ORGANIZATION> said Monday it has instituted formal proceedings against a <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> judge who said he gave a murderer a lighter sentence partly because the two victims were `` queers.'' The commission said a master appointed by the <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> would hold a hearing on complaints against Judge <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> <PERSON> Hampton </PERSON>, then report to the commission. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said in December that he sentenced 18-year-old <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Bednarski </PERSON> to 30 years in prison instead of a maximum life sentence because the two men he killed were homosexuals. <PERSON> Bednarski </PERSON> was convicted of the execution-style slayings of <PERSON> Tommy </PERSON> <PERSON> Trimble </PERSON>, 34, and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON>, 27, who were found shot to death in a <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> park. `` I do n't care much for queers cruising the streets picking up teen-age boys. I've got a teen-age boy,'' <PERSON> Hampton </PERSON> said at the time. His remarks triggered protests from homosexual and civil liberties groups, who staged a series of demonstrations and news conferences in December to call for his removal from the bench. The commission said in a brief statement Monday that it had had a `` large number of complaints in this matter.''

<TEXT>
 A British journalist says she and a colleague were arrested four times for clandestinely filming rural areas of <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> wrecked by President <PERSON> Nicolae </PERSON> <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON>'s agricultural modernization scheme. Sue <PERSON> Lloyd-Roberts </PERSON> said she managed to save her videocassettes from confiscation by hiding them in her underwear whenever she was arrested and handing authorities footage of home movies the two had brought along. She and colleague <PERSON> Vivian </PERSON> <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> overcame stringent restrictions on foreign news coverage by entering the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc country posing as tourists, she said. Her footage, broadcast on <ORGANIZATION> Independent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION>, showed empty, brick-strewn fields where three villages had stood until last fall, and a signpost with its place name replaced. These villages appeared on older maps which were already unobtainable in <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>, Ms. <PERSON> Lloyd-Roberts </PERSON> said. An unidentified peasant woman was shown describing what had happened: `` We worked all our lives. They destroyed everyone's home. My house was knocked to the ground. They've made us live in new blocks. Everything is wretched and miserable. What can be done?'' The report said people spoke of villagers being killed resisting militiamen who evicted them from their homes on 24 hours notice. The demolitions are part of <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON>'s plan to raze up to 7,000 of <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>'s 13,000 villages and resettle the population in so-called agro-industrial centers. `` <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON> wants to create his ` Communist Man,' and he has to destroy the Romanian village because that's where the opposition to communism is total,'' <PERSON> Ion </PERSON> <PERSON> Rativ </PERSON>, a Romanian emigre leader in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, told <ORGANIZATION> ITN </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>Primeval Forest Is Last Refuge For Lowland Gorilla</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BAYANGA, Central African Republic (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 This is as remote a place as you can get in <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. The large-scale map of the <LOCATION> Bayanga </LOCATION> region shows only primeval forest crossed by rivers with not a single paved road. In this heart of darkness, hundreds of miles from the nearest village, man's closest relative in the animal kingdom, the lowland gorilla, has found his last refuge, a sanctuary of sorts from Pygmy tribes and others who hunt him for his flesh and his hide. The gorilla is an endangered species and theoretically under tough protection in the Central African Republic. But the government has neither the money nor the personnel to enforce the protective laws. There are two main groups of gorillas in <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>: the mountain gorilla in <LOCATION> Rwanda </LOCATION> and eastern <LOCATION> Zaire </LOCATION> _ whose habitat and life style have been fully explored _ and the lowland gorilla who remains largely a mystery. The mountain gorilla can be seen from peak to peak and gradually allows himself to be approached as he becomes familiar with human beings. The lowland gorilla is supremely shy and elusive, explains <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forestry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studies </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Haven </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON>, who has made the gorilla his life's work, rarely gets close enough to strike up an acquaintance In more than five years' work almost exclusively concentrated on the lowland gorilla, <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON> has yet to get one accustomed to the human presence in the forest He estimates that a desolate area of 40,000 square miles of forest where the <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> African </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cameroon </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Congo </LOCATION> meet may still have at least 90,000 gorillas permanently settled there. With the exception of rare logging camps along the rivers, there is no human activity in this area, and the gorillas have until recently remained undisturbed. In recent years, the logging camps have developed, and there has been `` heavy illegal poaching'' for meat and the ivory of elephants who are the other main inhabitants of the region. In the central market in <LOCATION> Bangui </LOCATION>, the Central African capital 220 miles to the east, stands are piled high smoked monkey meat, a local delicacy. `` Gorillas taste like monkeys, only better,'' said <PERSON> Pierre </PERSON> <PERSON> Somse </PERSON>, who is <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON>'s Pygmy guide. `` And there is more of them.'' <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON>, who lives in <LOCATION> Bayembe </LOCATION> with his wife and 3-year-old daughter, has been trying to teach the Pygmies why the gorillas are best left alone. It's an almost hopeless task. The Pygmies go after the gorillas with bows and arrows. But larger Africans, those brought in to work the logging camps, use rifles and even machine guns, <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON> said. `` They bribe the Pygmies to help them by giving them clothes and liquor. In some areas, we find snares made of cables stolen from the logging companies every few yards along trails used by the gorrillas.'' The gorillas eat the fleshy leaves of the ever-present ginger-like Aframomum shrub, the fruit of tropical trees and the eggs of termites. `` It's quite common to see a 400-pound silverback gorilla climb more than 100 feet up into the trees to get at the fruit,'' <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON> said. `` They love that more than anything. `` They will even build a nest up in the trees and sleep there.'' In some areas on the ground, gorilla nests are visible every five or six yards. But the gorillas scamper away when they sense a human being approach. <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON> has been trying to persuade the Central African government to set up a wildlife reserve in the remote southwestern tip of the country. But in reality, the effort is useless unless the other two governments in the area, the <LOCATION> Congo </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Cameroon </LOCATION>, cooperate. Meanwhile, the poaching goes on. Even poorly paid wildlife guards sometimes find it more worth their while to hunt gorillas and elephants. And the dense forest paradoxically helps to protect the poachers from the guards. `` It would help to be able to get a radio tag on the animals,'' <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON> said. `` We have to crawl on our hands and feet to get close to them, and even then we do n't see them'til we are a foot or two away. With a radio, we could find a place ahead of them and watch them coming.'' He said the gorillas share 90 percent of human genetic materials, and, as such, are by far the closest animals to man. But he deplored the ineffectiveness of the present system of control and the inability of local governments and European and American organizations to stop the poaching. `` Recently we were in a camp on the <LOCATION> Sangha </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, where it forms the border with the <LOCATION> Congo </LOCATION>. A Congolese gunboat came up the river and ordered us to get out of there. We were clearly in the C.A.R. -LRB- Central African Republic -RRB-. But quite obviously, we were interfering with their poaching.''

<TEXT>
 The son of a former city police chief has been charged in a federal investigation of an alleged $ 3 million art-theft ring centered in <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION>, federal authorities said Monday. <PERSON> Jacob </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Schott </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, 48, of the <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION> suburb of <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> was arraigned Monday before <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Magistrate <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> on a charge of interstate transportation of stolen property. <PERSON> Schott </PERSON>, the third person to be charged in the case, filed notice he would plead guilty to the charge in a plea bargain with federal prosecutors. <PERSON> Schott </PERSON> agreed to cooperate with federal authorities and testify against <PERSON> Teddy </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rudder </PERSON>, an alleged member of the art-theft ring already charged in the case, said Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> DiPuccio </PERSON>. In exchange, federal authorities agreed not to file additional charges against <PERSON> Schott </PERSON>, who was released on his own recognizance, <PERSON> DiPuccio </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Schott </PERSON> is the son of the late <PERSON> Jacob </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Schott </PERSON>, who was <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION> police chief from 1967 to 1970. He is accused of transporting an $ 80,000 painting stolen from a <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION> house in February 1988 to <LOCATION> Indianapolis </LOCATION>, where is it was sold to an art dealer, <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agent <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Boldt </PERSON> said. The oil painting by <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Potthast </PERSON>, `` Women on Beach-Women in Water,'' was later sold to a <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fe </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.M. </LOCATION>, art dealer. The <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> Fe dealer saw the work listed in a bulletin on stolen art, and reported it to the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Boldt </PERSON> said. The charge against <PERSON> Schott </PERSON> carries a maximum sentence of 10 years in prisona and $ 250,00 fine on conviction. The ring is accused of stealing items with an estimated worth of $ 3 million from <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION> area homes, <PERSON> DiPuccio </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> estimates it has recovered more than $ 500,000 worth of items, most of them art objects. Rudder, 42, of <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION>, was arrested Feb. 7 and is jailed without bond while his case is pending before a federal grand jury, <PERSON> DiPuccio </PERSON> said. Rudder is charged with conspiracy to transport stolen property interstate, and is charged with interstate travel to commit an arson in an unrelated case, <PERSON> DiPuccio </PERSON> said. Federal authorities also have arrested <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Mulholland </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION> in the art-theft case. <PERSON> Mulholland </PERSON>, who is out on bond, is charged with an unrelated count of possession with intent to distribute cocaine, <PERSON> DiPuccio </PERSON> said.

 A train derailment caused an explosion and fire involving four tanker cars, forcing the evacuation of thousands of people from a residential and industrial area near downtown Sunday night, authorities said. No injuries were immediately reported. The burning cars were among 17 that derailed from a <ORGANIZATION> CSX </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> train at the <ORGANIZATION> B.F. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Goodrich </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION> plant, said <LOCATION> Akron </LOCATION> Fire Chief <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Romanoski </PERSON>. Nine of the cars carried highly flammable butane, <ORGANIZATION> CSX </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> said by telephone from <LOCATION> Jacksonville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla </LOCATION>. The eight other cars carried non-hazardous materials including vegetable oil, clay and sand, he said. <PERSON> Allan </PERSON> <PERSON> Franks </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Ohio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said one of the cars contained butadiene, which may produce hazardous smoke when burned, but <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> said the petroleum derivative was not in any of the derailed cars. <PERSON> Romanoski </PERSON> said fires in three of the cars and been put out and one car was still burning late Sunday night. Firefighters had planned to allow the fourth car to burn itself out. The accident occurred about 7:30 p.m., authorities said. Firefighters ran hoses up to the train to spread water on adjoining cars to cool them and diminish the possibility they would explode, he said. `` The area was evacuated because of the danger of explosion in the surrounding tank cars,'' <PERSON> Romanoski </PERSON> said. At least 1,500 homes in an area within one-half mile of the plant were evacuated, but the number of evacuees was not immediately available, Mayor <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Plusquilic </PERSON> said. The evacuees were taken by bus to a high school and to the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Akron </ORGANIZATION>'s Memorial Hall, said <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Swearengin </PERSON>, the county emergency management coordinator. <PERSON> Romanoski </PERSON> said people would not be allowed to return to their homes until the fire was extinguished. He said he did not know when that would be, `` but just as a yardstick, we're saying ` plan on being there overnight at least,''' he said. The train was not making a stop at the Goodrich plant, but was using its tracks to pass through the area, said <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Fletcher </PERSON>, plant manager. The train, which had a total of 45 cars, was en route from <LOCATION> Willard </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, to <LOCATION> Akron </LOCATION> and back to <PERSON> Willard </PERSON>, <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> said. He did not know where the train's next stop was scheduled. He said the train carried a crew of three or four, and that no crew members were injured. <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> said investigators from <ORGANIZATION> CSX </ORGANIZATION> would arrive in <LOCATION> Akron </LOCATION> early Monday morning. No cause for the accident had been determined Sunday night, he said. Witnesses said flames from the burning tankers could be seen for miles. Akron-area hospitals reported no injuries four hours after the explosion, but some area residents reported feeling nauseated.

<HEAD>Publicized Drug Seizures Having Little Effect on Supply, Officials
Say</HEAD>

 The large drug seizures announced with fanfare by law enforcement authorities are having little effect on supplies on the street, with dealers simply absorbing them as a cost of doing business, federal officials say. `` Historically, a manager of drug couriers gives up one courier who is body carrying -LRB- drugs -RRB- to take your attention away from four more,'' said <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Norsworthy </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> agent at the <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Paso </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>. `` People walk away from a brand new aircraft after one load and consider that an expense of the trip,'' he said. `` The same goes for boats, automobiles, campers. They expect to pay a price.'' A better way to assess how the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is doing in the war on drugs is to ignore the ballyhoo about drug busts and concentrate on the price and purity level of drugs on the street, says Sen. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Biden </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, D-Del. `` For too long, when we've asked whether or not our drug strategy is working, the administration has cited record arrest and seizure data,'' said <PERSON> Biden </PERSON>, who chairs the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. A check of price and purity of drugs on the streets, <PERSON> Biden </PERSON> said, reveals that `` cocaine and heroin on the streets are much cheaper and more potent than they were five years ago.'' In 1982, cocaine sold at the retail level at a nationwide range of $ 2,000 to $ 3,000 per ounce and was 50 percent to 60 percent pure, said <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Cornelius </PERSON> <PERSON> Dougherty </PERSON>. In 1988, the street price of cocaine had dropped to $ 500 to $ 2,000 per ounce and it was 80 percent pure, said <PERSON> Dougherty </PERSON>, who said the information came from drug seizures, undercover drug buys, intelligence gathered and records seized. The amount of drugs seized `` is not a dent'' in comparison with what is coming into the country and being produced domestically, said <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Maurice </PERSON> <PERSON> Hill </PERSON>. Given the uncertainty over exactly how large the nation's illegal drug market is, there are very few solid numbers about anything, which gives drug busts and amounts seized a certain cachet. There is not even a clear total of the amount of seizures around the country, the one number in the maze of drug statistics that could be expected to be solid. One problem is that many different agencies may take credit for the same bust. `` It's a quagmire,'' says <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> Lt. Cmdr. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON>. `` If you add them up, you'll find the government -LRB- claiming it -RRB- got 10 times what it actually seized. ... Everyone's trying to make themselves look good.'' <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON> outlined a hypothetical case in which the <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> provides the intelligence on an incoming shipment, <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> radar locates the ship, a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> jet spots the ship, the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> tracks it and the final seizure is conducted by a local sheriff in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. `` Even if everyone was trying to do the right thing and no one was trying to cheat, it would still be a nightmare'' to sort out the various claims for responsibility, even though the agencies attempt to note when they have assisted and when they have made a seizure alone, he said. This problem was noted in 1983 by the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>, the investigative branch of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, and some efforts have been made to correct it. `` We've tried to get all the federal agencies to call into the <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Paso </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> where they give each seizure an identification number in case other police agencies claim it as well,'' said <PERSON> Hill </PERSON>, who still acknowledged `` there's no real way'' to tell how much the federal government seized last year. <PERSON> Norsworthy </PERSON>, who is special assistant to the special agent in charge of EPIC, said that this program of giving each seizure a Federal Drug Identification Number `` does avoid duplication.'' However, <PERSON> Norsworthy </PERSON> said EPIC has not been providing annual totals for federal drug seizures and the information it started collecting only recently is limited because seizures must meet a threshold _ such as a minimum of 1 pound of cocaine _ before they are given identification numbers. In addition, `` absolutely no one'' is compiling figures of local police seizures unless they choose to call in, he said. `` I do n't believe that you will find a good, true figure -LRB- of the total amount of drugs seized -RRB-,'' said <PERSON> Norsworthy </PERSON>. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Weiner </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Select </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Narcotics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Abuse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION>, said he's not concerned about some duplication of seizure numbers, even if it's being done so agencies will look better and possibly get more government money for their efforts. `` Those guys need all the help they can get,'' <PERSON> Weiner </PERSON> said. Committee Chairman <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Rangel </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, `` does n't think you can overplay the danger and hard work the front lines in law enforcement have.'' Disregarding the likelihood of duplication, the federal agencies do n't make it easy even to add up what they each claim to have seized by maintaining different methods of calculation. Some compile figures by calendar years, others by fiscal years that start Oct. 1; some report on the number of pounds of drugs seized, others on kilograms. Law enforcement agencies also repeatedly seize millions of dollars in drug profits that go unclaimed, because anyone claiming the money would have to prove it was his and say where it came from, <PERSON> Hill </PERSON> said. `` I recall a little old lady way back in the early 70s who handed me a shoe box full of $ 20 bills and said she was being paid to carry it to a woman in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Norsworthy </PERSON> said. The woman, who disclaimed any knowledge of the contents or the rightful owner, was allowed to continue her trip and the government got the money since no one claimed it.

<HEAD>WASHINGTON TODAY: Win or Lose, Tower Nomination Changes Assumptions</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAWRENCE L. KNUTSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 When a conservative activist told the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> he had seen former Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tower </PERSON> drunk in public, he set off a chain of events shattering the assumption that the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> will protect its own no matter what. Ill-founded or not, the assumption was that the nomination of the feisty <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> had relatively clear sailing in his quest to be confirmed as President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s secretary of defense and that only minimal attention would be paid to decades of rumors that he had a serious drinking problem and a fondness for women to whom he was not married. The testimony of conservative <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Weyrich </PERSON>, who opposes some Tower positions on defense issues, inspired a rush of similar allegations. An ongoing <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> investigation was broadened. The result: Senators were forced to take the concerns about Tower seriously. The nomination of the man who until three years ago was chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> was suddenly in deep trouble in that committee and in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> itself. The dispute over Tower threatens the spirit of bipartisanship which the president sought to build in his inaugural address little more than a month ago. All 11 <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> members of the <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> voted `` no'' on Tower. All nine Republicans voted `` yes.'' A similarly partisan split is possible when the full <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> votes. In an attempt to prevent that and salvage his nomination, Tower made an extraordinary promise on Sunday, vowing not to take a single drink if he is confirmed. But the struggle over Tower and his alleged problems already has brought a large degree of unaccustomed pain in a legislative institution where progress is marked by the free flow of flattery, in which all senators are invariably addressed as `` distinguished'' and `` honorable.'' `` I can recall few equivalent instances on major issues in my <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> career where my colleagues were so genuinely torn by the evidence and undecided in their position until the time came to vote,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON>, D-Ga., the current <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> chairman <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> voted `` no'' on Tower. Seventy-one members of the 101st <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> served when Tower was a member. None has come forward with a personal account of ever seeing him intoxicated or obviously out of control. Several senators, all Republicans, have insisted the opposite is true, that they have observed Tower in periods of stress, during late-night sessions of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, during extensive overseas travel and on numerous social occasions and never saw him intoxicated or exercising poor judgment. But others, mostly Democrats, say they are deeply troubled by the allegations assembled during the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> investigation. These include <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON>, who, when he marked Tower's retirement from the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> in 1984, suggested the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> senator might one day be deservedly selected as secretary of defense and praised him for `` the background and knowledge that are indispensable in the defense arena.'' Senators voicing concern over Tower's alleged drinking problem insist that his status as a former senator and as a principal arms control negotiator in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> can not outweigh concerns that a secretary of defense must be alert and ready to respond to crisis 24 hours a day. `` We must not overlook a nominee's problems and subject him to less rigid standards just because he once served in this body,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON>, D-W. <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>'s president pro In an interview, <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> asserted that nothing has changed in the way the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> judges Cabinet-level nominees but added that `` a new set of circumstances has come to center stage.'' `` If the same nominee had come to center stage 100 years ago he would have been rejected by his colleagues,'' <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> contended. But others saw two centuries of <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> traditions under assault. `` It seems to me we are on the verge ... of tearing this place apart,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Republican Leader <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>, who said unfounded allegations are `` coming out of the woodwork, over the transom, under the door.'' `` We have to have some fairness,'' <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said. `` There could be some hypocrisy around here.'' Some senators say Tower's conduct in the past is being unfairly judged by the changed standards of the present. `` This is a different era,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Alaska </LOCATION>, who says he never saw Tower take a drink during working hours and never saw him `` where he was not in complete control of his brain.'' `` The whole country is drinking less, and that includes members of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> _ everybody is more health-conscious,'' <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> says. `` We did drink more in the 60's and 70's,'' he said. `` We had more private time then. ... And if there is any place that will bring up a drinking problem it is right here in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>.'' <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> predicts that the Tower controversy will lead to a closer examination of the private habits of all politicians. `` Yes, this has opened a can of worms,'' he said. `` But there will be even more of a can of worms before this is over. `` People will ask all politicians, ` Do you have a drinking problem?'''

<HEAD>Farmers Face Higher Seed Prices</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Seed prices are higher as farmers head into the spring planting season, largely because of last year's drought but also because of huge additions to the government's conservation program, according to <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> analysts. A survey of companies by the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Seed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> last August indicated that 45 percent of the planned seed corn production was wiped out by the drought, the department's <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said. To make up the losses, many of the companies planned off-season seed corn production in southern areas of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. `` According to industry sources, the off-season production and carryover stock should provide adequate seed corn supplies for domestic use in 1989, if planted acreage does n't exceed 78 million acres,'' the agency said in a report. `` However, some popular hybrids may be in short supply, requiring farmers to choose other varieties.'' Results of a survey among farmers to determine planting intentions this spring will be issued by <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> on March 31. Corn plantings totaled 67.6 million acres last year, 65.7 million in 1987 and 76.7 million in 1986. Two factors add up to planting costs: acreage and prices. And in most cases, farmers are planting more acres this year, and prices are higher. Overall, the <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION>'s `` prices paid'' index for all seeds is expected to rise 10 percent to 15 percent from year-earlier levels. `` Several seed corn firms have announced average increases of 10 percent to 15 percent in the spring price,'' the report said. `` Soybean, wheat, oat and barley seed prices tend to follow commercial crop prices, which have climbed substantially since the beginning of 1988. Cotton prices, however, have fallen over the last year.'' The Conservation Reserve Program, which has a goal of taking 40 million to 45 million acres of highly erodible land from crop production by the end of 1990, has helped boost grass seed prices. Under CRP contracts, farmers agree to plant the idled land with grass or trees as protective cover. As of now, more than 28 million acres have been signed into the <ORGANIZATION> CRP </ORGANIZATION>, with 90 percent of it to be planted to grass. The report said that if yields of grass seed are normal this season, the supply of new seed should increase. But if <ORGANIZATION> CRP </ORGANIZATION> and foreign demand for grass seed do n't ease, higher prices can be expected in 1989. `` Between 1985 and 1988, grass seed prices for timothy and annual ryegrass increased 124 percent and 28 percent, respectively,'' the report said. Meanwhile the reduced seed output because of last year's drought has affected exports, mainly corn and soybeans. `` Exports are likely to be down in 1989, while imports are expected to rise,'' the report said. `` However, neither exports nor imports of corn and soybean seed typically constitute a large share of total <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> seed consumption.'' However, seed exports are valuable, totaling a record of $ 374 million in the 1987 calendar year, up 1 percent from 1986, the report said. The increase was primarily due to larger shipments of soybean and vegetable seeds. The decline in corn seed exports in 1988 is likely to mostly be felt by <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, the report said. Major soybean seed buyers are <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. `` While the full effects of the drought on seed corn exports will not be known until later in 1989, the two major seed corn export markets, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, showed declines of 18 percent and 51 percent respectively, during the first nine months of 1988,'' the report said. But those sharp declines probably were due to tighter sanitary restrictions imposed on imports by the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION>, the report added. Imports of corn seed, up sharply last year, have traditionally been mostly from <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> and lesser amounts from <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION>. But in the first nine months of 1988, <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION> provided 45 percent of the imported corn seed, up from only 2 percent in the same period of 1987. Increases also were reported from <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>.

 Hot lights rather than boiling water may have killed a 1 \ - pound lobster that gained attention when the woman who bought it for a Valentine's Day feast decided to spare it from <PERSON> Suzanne </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said the $ 14 <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> lobster she dubbed <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> died this weekend. <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Gerontis </PERSON>, a seafood merchant who had offered to fly the lobster back to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> so that it could be tossed back into the ocean, told Mrs. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> on Friday that <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> was terminally ill.

<HEAD>Democrats Trying to Avoid Being Outmaneuvered By Bush on Budget</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALAN FRAM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Congressional Democrats are split over their budget strategy, two weeks after President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> put them on the spot with a $ 1.16 trillion spending proposal that leaves many of the difficult questions unanswered. Some leading Democrats lean toward cooperation with the administration _ perhaps culminating in full-fledged, high-level negotiations _ as the best way to forge a spending plan and to cut the deficit to $ 100 billion, as required under the Gramm-Rudman balanced budget law. <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Leon </PERSON> <PERSON> Panetta </PERSON>, D-Calif., and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Maine </LOCATION>, are among those advocating a cooperative approach `` My sense is that as long as the administration wants to discuss issues and look at options together, we're prepared to do that,'' <PERSON> Panetta </PERSON> said in an interview. Others, including <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, are less disposed to collaborate beyond the consultations already under way among White House and congressional budget writers, at least for now. Some of these lawmakers argue that Democrats can gain politically by continuing to attack <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s budget, and say there is no hurry to work out a bargain on the spending plan just yet. `` It's the administration that feels an urgency to get things going,'' says <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Sasser </PERSON>, D-Tenn. Others, including many liberals, are even more militant, arguing that domestic programs would fare better if the Democratic-controlled <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> wrote its own budget An agreement with the administration risks having Democrats share blame with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> for harsh cuts in popular programs, these legislators say. `` The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> budget has the rhetoric of a kinder, gentler <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, but it has the fiscal numbers of an austere, harsh <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' says Rep. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, a member of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Democratic leadership and the former chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> budget panel. `` The Democrats have to come up with their own budget.'' When <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> presented his spending proposal to the Democratic-controlled <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on Feb. 9, he simultaneously asked the lawmakers to negotiate with him over its final shape. Congressional Democrats complain that the president's blueprint is woefully lacking in details, especially on the cuts that would be needed to meet overall spending limits envisioned in the plan. They say that before they agree to work out a budget jointly with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, they need specific figures indicating exactly how much the administration proposes spending on the hundreds of separate programs covered by the budget. Some observers, however, believe <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has won the first round of the public relations war. `` Do you really think <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Sixpack </PERSON> thinks it's unreasonable for the president to say he wants to sit down with <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and work it out?'' asked <PERSON> Carol </PERSON> <PERSON> Cox </PERSON>, president of the bipartisan <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> a </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Responsible </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION>, which monitors budget activity. `` At the moment, we're boxed in,'' says Rep. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Durbin </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ill </LOCATION>., a budget committee member `` The <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people are looking at <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to make a move.'' Says Rep. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Frenzel </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>, ranking <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> member on the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> budget panel, `` It's been a pleasure to watch them writhe this week.'' Some Democrats say accusing <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> of producing a budget that leaves about $ 10 billion worth of cuts for later bargaining _ and that makes only tiny increases in priority domestic areas _ will eventually pay off with the public. <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> and some other liberals say that rather than enacting <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s plan, they prefer writing a <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> budget that gets half of its savings from domestic spending and half from defense That is the same formula under which the Gramm-Rudman law automatically slashes spending if the deficit target is missed, and they argue that domestic spending would fare better this way. Some Democrats fear that even if they negotiate a budget settlement with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, Republicans will campaign against them in the next elections by blaming them for the cuts anyway. If there are negotiations between the administration and <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, a two-year budget _ rather than the usual one-year plan _ could well emerge. This would get messy decisions for fiscal 1991 out of the way before next year's campaigns, and free lawmakers to concentrate on policy issues instead of spending woes.

<HEAD>Conservation Groups Urge Bush Administration to Buy Park Land</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Conservation groups want President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to reverse the record of his predecessor and revive a program to protect land around national preserves. `` You can defer buying a car, but a desirable piece of land is likely to turn into a shopping mall or become too expensive. Special areas bought today will pay enormous dividends for future generations,'' says <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Frampton </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Wilderness </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>. A coalition led by the <ORGANIZATION> Wilderness </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> urged the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration Sunday to spend $ 781 million next year to buy land that might otherwise be lost to developers in and around national preserves in 46 states. `` You ca n't keep putting off these investments,'' <PERSON> Frampton </PERSON> said. The money would come from the Land and Water Conservation Fund, created by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in 1965 to protect natural resources. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> may appropriate $ 900 million a year from the fund, which gets 80 percent of its money from oil-drilling on the federally owned outer continental shelf. But purchases of land under the fund fell sharply under President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, from $ 509 million in 1980 to $ 206 million this year. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has recommended keeping investments at $ 206 million for the fiscal year beginning next October. As an example of land lost to development because of delays, <PERSON> Frampton </PERSON> cited a 700-acre tract in Devil's Canyon in <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>, which conservationists urged the government to buy for three years. The land has since been subdivided. Most of the recommended tracts lie within national parks or forests and would not expand the boundaries of federal lands, the statement said. The recommended purchases include land at <ORGANIZATION> Chincoteague </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Refuge </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, Olympic National Park in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Acadia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Santa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monica </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mountains </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Recreation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Area </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, and along the <ORGANIZATION> Appalachian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trail </ORGANIZATION>, which runs from <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>. The only states in which purchases were not recommended were <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Tornado Deaths Below Average in '88</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 One of nature's most vicious spectacles, the tornado, is poised to renew its annual assault on <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, as changeable spring weather breeds the storms that spawn twisters. Last year was one of fewer than normal tornado deaths, but even so, more than 700 of the violent funnel clouds struck the nation. In 1988 the nation recorded 32 tornado deaths, down from the 59 killed a year earlier and well below the long-term average of 99 fatalities annually, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> reported on Sunday. But while that's good news, it is n't an indication that the danger has lessened. `` There is no way of knowing what this tornado season will bring, but the way to survive is through preparedness,'' said <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferguson </PERSON>, deputy director of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Severe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Storms </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forecast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. Meteorologists have attributed the decline in tornado deaths in recent years to increased public awareness of the storms, which are most common in May and June but can occur in any month of the year. Unusually warm and wet weather last November helped trigger a record number of tornadoes for that month, at 121 across the country. The average for November is only 23 tornadoes, and the record had been 81, set in 1973. Last year also recorded the largest tornado outbreak in 14 years. That took place on Mother's Day when 57 twisters tore through parts of <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>. That outbreak did n't cause any deaths, although 10 injuries were reported <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> recorded the most fatalities last year with six deaths apiece, followed by <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> with five. Four people were killed in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> and two each in <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION>. States with a single fatality apiece were <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. The transition from winter to spring, spurring unsettled weather and frequent thunderstorms, helps create tornadoes, violently twisting winds that reach down from thunderclouds. After a low point in the winter they begin to increase sharply in March and peak in May with a national average of 166 twisters in that month, according to records kept at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Climatic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>. June ranks second, averaging 150 tornadoes, followed by April with 109 in a typical year. Other months averaging more than a twister-a-day somewhere in the nation are July, 82; August, 57; March, 50 and September, 38. Hot weather stirring the air helps form thunderstorms and their tornadoes, with 60 percent of all twisters occurring between noon and sunset, according to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atmospheric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION>. Tornadoes are least likely during the early morning just before sunrise. The typical tornado is only about 50 yards wide and travels about two miles on the ground _ 87 percent of the time heading toward the northeast, <ORGANIZATION> NCAR </ORGANIZATION> researchers report. But while an individual twister can cover only a small area, they often come in groups and in the affected area destruction can be total. The familiar funnel cloud is the most common sign of a tornado although adjacent winds can also cause severe damage. When twisters are in an area, common sense and knowing a few simple rules can save lives, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> says. If tornadoes threaten, turn on radio or television to keep current on the danger, the agency says. The weather service even has its own radio network which can provide continual updates. If a twister is reported, safety rules include: _ At home, seek shelter immediately in a basement or interior hallway Stay away from windows and outside walls. _ At school, move to hallways and lie flat on the floor with head covered _ In a mobile home or trailer, leave immediately Head for a secure shelter or lie flat on the ground. Be wary of areas with poor drainage, however, because of the possibility of flooding from the thunderstorm. _ At work or in public buildings, head for interior hallways on the lowest floor, or designated shelter areas _ In an automobile, leave immediately Do not try to outrun a tornado.

<HEAD>UNDATED: for keeps.    In Miami, an undercover narcotics team made
14 arrests in assembly line fashion. One of the busts was a 16-year-old
selling crack outside his apartment.    Plainclothes partners buy drugs.
Ten tactical officers, known as the ``Jump Out Boys'' because they leap
out of their car whenever they see a crime, make the arrests.    Across
the city that day, about 200 of an estimated 1,000 armed robberies, auto
thefts and burglaries were believed to have been drug-related, said police
spokesman Ray Lang.    ``The burglaries and robberies are probably 50
percent related to drugs,'' said Lang. ``Whatever they steal, they pawn
it and use the money to buy drugs.''</HEAD>

 In <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>, six men were face down on the floor of an abandoned, smoke-filled apartment as a handful of officers stood over them with guns drawn. Fragments of a copper mesh pad were found during a search, but the suspect denied knowing the pads often are used to strain crack. `` Some drug addict put that there,'' the man told police. `` This is a day-in, day-out battle,'' said Lt. <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Richie </PERSON>, who heads the evening crew at <ORGANIZATION> Dallas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s central division. If a crack addict has a $ 20,000 a year habit, he must steal about $ 200,000 worth of goods to support it, according to Capt.

<TEXT>
 The young businesswoman looked tense and worried when the morning papers brought the news of the cordoba's fifth devaluation this year. The government's latest devaluation of the national currency meant only one thing: higher prices for food and transport; higher costs for doing business; yet another round of belt-tightening. `` If we ate meat three times a week, now we'll eat it once a week and so on until we become vegetarians,'' the woman said, toying with a pencil at her desk. `` But even vegetables are expensive _ when you can find them.'' The woman and her husband are urban professionals in their early 30s with a small business. They are expecting their third child. In private conversations, the two spoke of the hardships the middle class is enduring as a result of <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s economic crisis and the thought that crosses so many people's minds: pack up and leave for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, where many have relatives and friends. The devaluation of the cordoba is part of the government's efforts to halt hyperinflation `` You keep cutting back and cutting back -LRB- on the household budget -RRB-, but now I'm wondering what else I can eliminate,'' the woman added. `` And if that's us and people like us,'' she said, leaning forward to emphasize her point, `` can you imagine what poor people are going through?'' Poor and middle-class people are leaving the country in droves, undeterred even by a get-tough <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> immigration policy that took effect last Tuesday. Despite a tripling of the price for a new passport, Nicaraguans still flock to immigration offices. A senior Western diplomat said figures compiled from various sources indicate that from 1979 _ when the leftist <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> came to power _ through 1987, <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> lost about 8,500 professionals. The diplomat, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said about 2,000 professional and business people left the country in 1988 alone _ despite the signing of a preliminary peace accord in March after seven years of war with the Contra rebels. <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s population is about 3 million `` That's people in education, business, engineering, medicine,'' the diplomat said. `` We're not talking about ideology; these are people seeking better horizons.'' With Thursday's latest currency devaluation, the official rate of exchange became 3,800 cordobas per dollar, up from 3,200. At the new rate, a typical monthly salary of 200,000 cordobas is worth $ 52. Many professionals earn up to 500,000 cordobas a month, which translates to only $ 131. A new passport costs 150,000 cordobas. With the lastest devaluation, the price of a gallon of gasoline rose to $ 2.07, up from $ 1.76 a gallon. Higher fuel costs mean higher prices for food, which is trucked into the city from the countryside. `` She's been pressuring me for us to get out of here and go to <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>,'' the woman's husband confided when his wife was out of earshot. `` But I ca n't abandon my business now and lose all I've put into it.'' He said that even if he wanted to sell, he'd be hard pressed to find a buyer. To control runaway inflation that reached 20,000 in 1988 and 97 percent in January alone, the government is firing more than 30,000 workers, slashing public spending, and tightly restricting credit. President <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> has summed up his government's attitude toward the exodus by saying that whoever does n't like it here can `` leave for <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> to look for democracy and ways to enrich themselves.'' The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Immigration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Naturalization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> has summed up its new policy, aimed at Central Americans who usually come in illegally through <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, by saying that anyone who ca n't prove political persecution will be denied asylum and immediately jailed and deported. That policy led to only a small decrease last week in the number of people wanting to leave, said <PERSON> Sergio </PERSON> <PERSON> Domingo </PERSON> <PERSON> Prado </PERSON>, who owns a travel agency specializing in trips to <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. He said he used to organize trips to <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION> buy bus but stopped because every increase in fuel costs increased the price of his bus tickets. `` People did n't understand. Now I just deal in plane tickets. They're more stable,'' he said. His customers often make their way from <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION> into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. On a recent evening, people began assembling on a sidewalk in a lower-class neighborhood of <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION> to wait for a bus to <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION>. Sitting on the curb in front of a travel agency were small knots of travelers and their relatives. Some were silent; others cried. <PERSON> Lourdes </PERSON> <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> Rayo </PERSON> <PERSON> Vargas </PERSON>, 23, was leaving with her 15-year-old sister and their mother. They were the last in the family to leave. Their father and three brothers had left for <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION> four months ago. `` I was the only one in the family working,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Rayo </PERSON>. `` I worked in a supermarket, then I sold shoes. Now I've been out of work for seven months.'' She said she gave up trying to find a job.

<TEXT>
 After three frustrating years, Swedes hope the mystery behind the assassination of Prime Minister <PERSON> Olof </PERSON> <PERSON> Palme </PERSON> is finally solved and that his accused killer will soon be tried. Prosecutors are reported to be worried, however, that their case may not hold up against the man arrested 10 weeks ago on suspicion of gunning down Palme on a <LOCATION> Stockholm </LOCATION> street on Feb. 28, 1986. They acknowledge that crucial pieces of evidence are missing. If they have found a motive, they are n't saying. Legal experts say the case will rest on whether a chain of circumstantial evidence can be established. `` The prosecution is in bad shape if they do n't find the murder weapon or present other very strong forensic evidence,'' said <PERSON> Lena </PERSON> <PERSON> Holmqvist </PERSON>, a lecturer in criminal law at <ORGANIZATION> Uppsala </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. Since the shooting, police have dedicated nearly one million man-hours and hundreds of millions of dollars chasing international conspiracy theories centering on <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> or on Kurdish terrorists. In the end, the suspect they arrested was a Swede, a loner with a previous manslaughter conviction and a history of drug addiction, alcohol abuse and psychiatric treatment. The arrest Dec. 14 of <PERSON> Christer </PERSON> <PERSON> Pettersson </PERSON>, 41, came as such an anticlimax that one legal commentator wrote in the <ORGANIZATION> Dagens </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nyheter </ORGANIZATION> daily that `` the borderline between reality and fiction is being erased.'' <PERSON> Pettersson </PERSON>'s lawyer says his client has denied any connection with the slaying, which occurred as Palme was walking home from a movie with his wife <PERSON> Lisbet </PERSON>, who was grazed by a second bullet and survived. Prosecutors have released virtually no information about their case, and <PERSON> Pettersson </PERSON>'s name can not even be published here under Swedish press regulations. But they have made enough headway to persuade a judge five times to extend the two-week detention order against him. `` There has been progress ... but we can not make any estimate of how long the investigation will go on,'' chief prosecutor <PERSON> Jorgen </PERSON> <PERSON> Almblad </PERSON> said two weeks ago. Published reports say the prosecution's case was built on witnesses who placed the suspect at the scene. Mrs. <PERSON> Palme </PERSON> has identified <PERSON> Pettersson </PERSON> as the gunman, but without absolute certainty, the reports say. If the case against <PERSON> Pettersson </PERSON> falls apart, the testimony of the few eyewitnesses would be useless against anyone else, virtually destroying any chance of sending <PERSON> Palme </PERSON>'s killer to prison. <PERSON> Pettersson </PERSON>, who was questioned briefly and released shortly after the murder, came under suspicion again after police received a tip that his alibi was phony. He has a long criminal record, which includes the fatal bayonet stabbing of a man in a street brawl in 1970. `` I think most people were pleased that we finally have found someone and are relieved that it's a Swede,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Holmqvist </PERSON>. `` If it's an ordinary maniac, we can leave the whole story behind us.'' Under Swedish law, the case would be heard by the <LOCATION> Stockholm </LOCATION> district court before a panel of one judge and five laymen, each of whom have equal say on whether to convict. A 4-2 vote is enough for conviction, but a tie means acquittal. The slaying of <LOCATION> Palme </LOCATION>, a four-term prime minister who championed international disarmament, jolted Swedes from the idea that they were safe from the viciousness and terrorism that afflict other countries. But the national trauma is fading. Last year, people stopped putting fresh flowers on the improvised sidewalk monument where Palme fell. Palme's governing <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> party </ORGANIZATION> said it planned no ceremony to mark the anniversary this year. The three-year manhunt exposed some weaknesses in the Swedish criminal system. Many Swedes were astonished that a man with <PERSON> Pettersson </PERSON>'s violent past was free on the street. Several parliamentary committees criticized the police for bungling the investigation. For years, police and prosecutors squabbled over who was in charge of the case since the law is not specific. Frustration over the failure to make an arrest also encouraged overzealous authorities to approve a private investigation that overstepped legal limits. The resulting scandal forced the resignation of Justice Minister <PERSON> Anna-Greta </PERSON> <PERSON> Leijon </PERSON> in June, and a parliamentiary commitee is now trying to find out how much unauthorized eavesdropping and other illegal activity was going on.

 A surge in violence has raised fears of a leftist revolt and renewed repression by rightist death squads in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>, which is squeezed between a civil war in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> and a dying insurgency in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. Since Jan. 7, bombings have injured 10 people, three <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> soldiers have been wounded in attacks on <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> troops, and three people have been assassinated. Honduran officials, however, are quick to point out that the level of violence remains low by Central American standards. `` We are not in the middle of a communal war,'' said President <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Azcona </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoyo </PERSON> in an interview with The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. `` Health and education are more serious problems than violence.'' But four bombings since Feb. 18 prompted the chief of the armed forces, Gen. <PERSON> Humberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Regalado </PERSON>, to announce Thursday increased internal security and vigilance at public buildings. Americans are `` briefed to keep a reasonable profile and be cautious in their daily lives,'' said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Embassy spokesman <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Barclay </PERSON>. He said the instructions had not changed since shots were fired at a military convoy on Feb. 1 and a bomb was tossed at a bus Feb. 18. About 1,200 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops are stationed at <LOCATION> Palmerola </LOCATION>'s Enrique Sotocano Air Base, and National Guard troops take part in frequent exercises. <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> received about $ 1.15 billion in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> civil and military aid from 1981 to 1988. Set like a keystone between <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> has frequently been involved in border problems and regional disputes, most recently by helping U.S.-supported Contra rebels trying to overthrow the leftist Sandinista government of <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. `` <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> has been the big loser in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Efrain </PERSON> <PERSON> Diaz </PERSON> <PERSON> Arrivillaga </PERSON>, presidential candidate of the small <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> party in elections set for Nov. 26. Some of the violence can be pinned on leftist groups like the <LOCATION> Cinchonero </LOCATION> guerrillas, but internal political disputes, drug trafficking and Machiavellian revenge theories also circulate, creating an atmosphere of uncertainty. No group has claimed responsibility for the most recent bombings. <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Montoya </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Honduran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, said they `` are related to conflicts of an internal order.'' He claimed the bombings are linked to drug trafficking and a recent police takeover at the Central Penitentiary, where guards were accused of taking payoffs. He refused to elaborate. The most significant killing, that of Gen. <PERSON> Gustavo </PERSON> <PERSON> Alvarez </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> on Jan. 25, was thoroughly professional. He was blasted by six gunmen who knew his routine, and the Cinchoneros promptly claimed responsibility. <PERSON> Alvarez </PERSON>, head of the military from 1982 to 1984, played godfather to the Contras. He was dumped by fellow officers and made an apparently genuine conversion to evangelical Christianity, carrying a Bible and refusing armed guards. `` He was an extremist. Maybe he went to another extreme,'' said <PERSON> Diaz </PERSON>. Many Hondurans fear right-wing repression more than a revived guerrilla force. In 1980-1984, when the <ORGANIZATION> Cinchonero </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Popular </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION> was most active, more than 130 death squad killings and disappearances were reported. That is far fewer than the tens of thousands who have died in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION>. But the specter of death squads caused an almost panicked reaction when the <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Anticommunist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> _ </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Triple </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> A </ORGANIZATION> _ distributed leaflets in late January threatening human rights and labor and political leaders. `` We hope that the response -LRB- to violence -RRB- is not repression,'' said <PERSON> Felix </PERSON> <PERSON> Molina </PERSON>, an official of the <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Molina </PERSON> claims Triple A is made up of army troops, but the military denies involvement. `` There's no evidence the Triple A exists. They have n't actually done anything. The leaflets could be produced by anyone,'' said <PERSON> Ruben </PERSON> <PERSON> Zepeda </PERSON>, the nation's attorney general. <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> was once the prototypical banana republic, with bananas its leading export and revolving door governments _ it suffered 17 coups or coup attempts in four years. The nation of about 5 million is the poorest in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. Illiteracy is estimated at 46 percent, unemployment 25 percent, inflation 30 percent. Border problems are historic. When the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> were trying to topple Nicaraguan dictator <PERSON> Anastasio </PERSON> <PERSON> Somoza </PERSON>, overthrown in 1979, many of their leaders lived in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>. In turn, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> used <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> to arm and train the Contras against the triumphant Sandinistas. The Contras, operating from bases on the eastern border, provided a buffer with <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. But now that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military aid to the rebels has ended, <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> finds itself playing host to an unemployed army of 11,000 and providing homes for an estimated 140,000 refugees from the guerilla wars. There also is trouble on the western border, where the leftist <ORGANIZATION> Farabundo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marti </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> is fighting the Salvadoran government. Angry Honduran officials say Salvadoran refugee camps are simply guerrilla training bases. Street life in <LOCATION> Tegucigalpa </LOCATION> appears unaffected by the scattered violence. Young men and women stroll the city center into the evening. There are classic signs of rural immigration and underemployment. Pregnant women sell food on the streets, young men sell trinkets, and beggars ask car owners to let them spend the night in their automobiles. Murders increased 15 percent, to 177 last year, and <PERSON> Zepeda </PERSON> said automatic rifles, sold by penniless Contras for $ 300 to $ 400, are showing up in the hands of ordinary criminals. `` The people are scared, and with good reason,'' said the daily <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tiempo </ORGANIZATION> in an editorial. `` The assassinations are an unequivocal sign that we are in the shadow of what could quickly develop into major bloodshed, as happened in <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>.''

<HEAD>Rough Going For Thatcher In Midterm</HEAD>
<HEAD>AP News Analysis</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s government seems to have hit a rough patch as its capitalist crusade begins to bite into the heart of British society. With the socialist and centrist opposition divided, the Conservatives continue to look unassailable. But some analysts say the government's prestige is threatened by rising inflation and interest rates, coupled with contentious reforms of fundamental institutions including the health service, education and the legal profession. They see a warning light in the result of Thursday's by-election to fill the vacant parliamentary seat of <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION>, in northern <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Tories </ORGANIZATION> won, but their thumping 19,576-vote majority in the June 1987 general election was slashed to 2,634 against a stunning resurgence of the centrist Democrats and Social Democrats. It was the biggest anti-Tory swing in any constituency since Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> came to office in May 1979. United, the centrists could have taken the seat easily. But they are deeply divided. Labor, the main opposition party, limped in with fewer than 3,000 votes, a predictable result in a wealthy rural constituency like <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION>. But in another by-election Thursday, in <LOCATION> Wales </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> saw its majority slip by about 6,500 votes against a much strengthened showing by <PERSON> Plaid </PERSON> <PERSON> Cymru </PERSON>, the separatist Welsh nationalist party. Tory analysts say the <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION> result is not surprising for a government nearing midterm, when by-elections often become instruments for registering protest votes. The conservative <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telegraph </ORGANIZATION> dismissed the result as `` a mild bout of midterm unpopularity.'' But the liberal Observer, while agreeing that midterm setbacks do not diminish the government's underlying strength, also looked at the opinion polls and said: `` Perhaps the tide is turning at last.'' A Gallup poll in The Sunday Telegraph put Labor and the <ORGANIZATION> Tories </ORGANIZATION> at 35 percent each in terms of public preference, while a Harris poll for the Observer put <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> one point ahead of the <ORGANIZATION> Tories </ORGANIZATION>, at 42 percent. The Observer said its poll of 1,027 respondents put Labor ahead for the first time since October 1986, and was Labor's best showing since 1983. The Telegraph did not say how many people were questioned and neither paper reported a margin of error. In the June 1987 general election the Conservatives took 42.3 percent of the vote to <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION>'s 30.8 percent and won a 102-seat parliamentary majority in the 650-seat House of Commons. The next general election must be held by mid-1992, but will likely be held sooner. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> is now losing a very large number of votes,'' said Professor <PERSON> Ivor </PERSON> <PERSON> Crewe </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> Essex </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> analyst. `` But these votes are being dissipated across more than one party. In other words, they're losing votes but they can still expect to go on gaining seats on a minority vote just as they did in <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION>,'' he told <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> television. In seeking to revamp the health service, legal professions and schools and inject them with a measure of private competition, the government is signaling that far from losing stamina after a decade in office, its reforming zeal is stronger than ever. The Tories say they want to broaden consumer choice and break down entrenched bureaucracies. But another Sunday Telegraph Gallup poll, published last week, found a large majority of teachers, doctors and lawyers opposing the reforms _ and a 7 percent swing in their voting intentions from the <ORGANIZATION> Tories </ORGANIZATION> to Labor. The government's prestige is suffering from an annual inflation rate above 7 percent and a prime lending rate of 14 percent. Also, its bold plans to sell off the water supply in <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Wales </LOCATION> as part of its privatization drive is proving unpopular. Consumers fear a sharp rise in water prices if the industry is to be profitable on the open market. The Richmond result, said the middle-of-the-road Independent newspaper, `` is certainly not an indication of irreversible decline. `` In this case, an energetic administration is busily forcing a great deal of highly contentious legislation through <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, much of it disturbing to middle-class voters.'' Even the usually pro-government <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> London </ORGANIZATION> warned that the loss of popularity stemmed not just from midterm doldrums, but from public suspicion of water privatization, health service restructuring and inflation. `` The government faces a period of highly sensitive public relations,'' it said, `` and must justify its policies convincingly.''

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Napoleon </PERSON> <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON> on Sunday called for a cease-fire and peace talks with leftist rebels, who have offered to take part in national elections set for March if the vote is postponed. <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON> said on nationwide television and radio that if the talks prove inconclusive on the postponement issue, he favors resolving it with a referendum. The president proposed that the U.S.-backed government and the rebel <ORGANIZATION> Farabundo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marti </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> `` unilaterally cease hostilities between Feb. 28 and June 1'' and begin peace talks Tuesday in <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION>. The rebels offered on Jan. 24 to take part in elections _ and recognize the results _ if the vote were postponed from March 19 until September, and if their security is guaranteed and electoral changes are made to ensure a fair vote. In an unprecedented meeting in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> last week, they told Salvadoran political leaders that they would lay down their arms if the election were postponed at least four months, the armed forces sharply reduced and the police reorganized. They also proposed direct talks with <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON>. There was no immediate rebel reaction to <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON>'s comments Sunday. In his speech, <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON> suggested that the guerrillas be incorporated into Salvadoran society and politics and that the Salvadorn armed forces be recognized as the only army in the country. He did not refer directly to the guerrilla proposal, but he said he would propose that the presidential balloting be postponed until April 30. He did not specify when a plebiscite might take place. <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON> said the delegation to peace talks would include representatives from the legislature, which is dominated by the right-wing <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION>, and the 13 political parties. He did not say whether he would participate in the talks or name a representative. He also did not explain why he suddenly changed his position of strongly opposing any delay in the elections. Proposing the referendum, <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON> said sovereignty rests with the <LOCATION> Salvadoran </LOCATION> people and for this reason a `` solution is possible through consulting the people.'' He said another way to postpone elections legally would be for the executive, legislative and judicial branches of the government to all agree on a legal mechanism to bring about a postponement. He implied the presidential polling could not be postponed beyond April 30. <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON> and the armed forces have been saying that a delay in the vote would be unconstitutional and military leaders have suggested publicly they may take over if the vote did not go on as scheduled. <PERSON> El </PERSON> <PERSON> Salvador </PERSON>'s constitution specifies that a new president is to take office on June 1. <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON> initially said he would let the political parties decide on the matter. Last Monday and Tuesday, a delegation of Salvadoran political leaders met in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> with rebel leaders. The meetings were cordial but ended without any agreement. The guerrillas contend that the politicial parties are hiding behind the constitution to avoid substantive talks. More than 70,000 people, most of them civilians, have died in 9-year-old war between the government and the leftist rebels. The guerrillas have steadfastly rejected the five national elections this decade as part of a U.S.-backed counterinsurgency campaign. <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON> said in his speech Sunday it was necessary to initiate `` a new search to put an end to the armed conflict that is covering our country with blood.'' He also said he had no personal ambitions in the matter: `` I beg of God that he lets our people find peace.''

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, after giving human rights apparent back-burner treatment in talks with Chinese leaders, told the vice premier today he thought it was wrong for authorities to bar a leading dissident from attending a dinner he hosted. White House press secretary <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also directed <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> Winston </PERSON> <PERSON> Lord </PERSON> to seek a meeting with the <ORGANIZATION> Chinese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> to learn why <PERSON> Fang </PERSON> <PERSON> Lizhi </PERSON>, an astrophysicist and prominent human rights activist, was intercepted as he tried to go into the dinner. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> learned of incident today, the day after it happened, and that he `` expressed regret'' to Vice Premier <PERSON> Wu </PERSON> <PERSON> Xueqian </PERSON> just before boarding Air Force One for <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. Police used the pretext of a traffic violation to stop a car carrying the 53-year-old <PERSON> Fang </PERSON> to the banquet Sunday night, halted a taxi that he transferred to and ordered a public bus not to pick him up. They insisted he was not on the guest list although the official <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> list bore his name. Police then tailed him, his wife and an American couple, <PERSON> Perry </PERSON> <PERSON> Link </PERSON>, a professor of Chinese literature and his wife, for an hour and a half as they walked to Lord's residence to seek help. <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Sheridan </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bell </PERSON> said that Lord was `` in the process'' of requesting a meeting with the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> to discuss the incident, which shocked and dismayed other outspoken Chinese intellectuals. He refused to disclose what message Lord would give the ministry or to characterize the degree of seriousness with which the incident was being treated. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> felt the Chinese trip had gone well, generally, and said the president takes the view that such problems as human rights should be dealt with in a low-key and private manner. Contradicting a statement he made a day earlier, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> also said that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> did raise the issue of human rights problems `` privately'' in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. But the president also heard <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> <PERSON> Ziyang </PERSON> lecture him about how dissidents were undermining economic reform in his country. In a telephone interview late Sunday, <PERSON> Fang </PERSON> said the police action was `` foolish'' and showed the government was weak and afraid of the growing vocalism of a small but growing community of disaffected intellectuals. `` ` It's a normal thing to attend a banquet but the authorities here are afraid of even that,'' <PERSON> Fang </PERSON> said <PERSON> Fang </PERSON>, an internationally known astrophysicist frequently referred to as the <PERSON> Andrei </PERSON> <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, was one of several government critics whom the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> invited to the banquet at a local hotel in an apparent gesture of support. The others _ including leading Marxist theorist <PERSON> Su </PERSON> <PERSON> Shaozhi </PERSON> and playwright <PERSON> Wu </PERSON> <PERSON> Zuguang </PERSON> _ attended without interference. But none is as well-known outside <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> as <PERSON> Fang </PERSON>, who stepped into the political limelight in 1986 with eloquent speeches to college students, calling for democracy and human rights.

<HEAD>Decade After TMI, Half in Poll See Another Accident as Likely</HEAD>

 Nearly a decade after the Three Mile Island accident, half those polled believe another serious nuclear power accident is likely, and eight in 10 people favor stricter safety standards. An Associated Press-Media General survey found support for continued use of nuclear plants now operating. But most opposed building new plants or starting up completed plants that are not yet in operation. Overall, 55 percent said they supported use of nuclear power to generate electricity. But 56 percent of the 1,162 adults polled said it is impossible to store radioactive waste from nuclear plants safely. And while most said the plants are safer now than a decade ago, 50 percent called an accident likely. The national poll had a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points. The survey was conducted Jan. 4-12 in anticipation of the 10th anniversary of the nation's worst commercial nuclear accident. The Three Mile Island accident, which began March 28, 1979, destroyed a reactor at the <LOCATION> Middletown </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, plant. Considerably tighter federal regulation of the commercial nuclear power industry followed the accident, and a solid 63 percent in the poll said they believed <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> nuclear plants are safer than they were 10 years ago. Nonetheless, an overwhelming 79 percent said the federal government should be even tougher when it comes to enforcing nuclear safety rules. And 62 percent said governors should be empowered to shut down nuclear plants in their states. Backing for nuclear power was markedly higher among men and Republicans. Two-thirds of those groups supported nuclear power generally, compared with half the <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> and independents and just 45 percent of the women polled. When asked to rate the chance of a serious accident at a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> nuclear plant, 11 percent overall chose `` highly likely'' and 39 percent said an accident was likely, for a total of 50 percent. Thirty percent said `` unlikely'' and 14 percent said `` highly unlikely,'' for a total of 44 percent. The rest had no opinion. Six in 10 women and as many Democrats called an accident likely, compared with four in 10 of the men and the Republicans. Among respondents with postgraduate schooling, just 37 percent called an accident likely; that swelled to 58 percent of those who has not gone beyond high school. Overall, only a third said more nuclear plants should be built in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Of those who favored more plants, three-quarters said they would accept one within 10 miles of their home. The government has not issued any new permits to build nuclear power plants since 1979. Just two in 10 said nuclear plants that have been completed but not yet licensed should be allowed to open. Such plants in <LOCATION> Seabrook </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.H. </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Shoreham </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, have been stalled in part by opposition from Gov. <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and, in <LOCATION> Seabrook </LOCATION>'s case, Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> of neighboring <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>. A governor is not empowered to close a plant outright. In the poll, however, six in 10 said a governor should have the authority to prevent a nuclear power plant from opening in his or her state, and as many said a governor should be empowered to shut down an operating plant. Just 9 percent said the nation's 108 fully operating commercial nuclear power plants should be closed down immediately; 48 percent said they should continue to operate and 35 percent said they should be phased out gradually. Eight percent had no opinion. Of those who wanted the plants phased out, a third wanted it done within five years, about a third within 10 years and the rest would allow longer. <ORGANIZATION> Media </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a communications company based in <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, publishes the Richmond Times-Dispatch, the Richmond News Leader, the <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION> -LRB- <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION> -RRB- <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION> and the <LOCATION> Winston-Salem </LOCATION> -LRB- <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION> -RRB- Journal, and operates TV stations <ORGANIZATION> WXFL </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION>, WCBD in <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> WJKS </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Jacksonville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla </LOCATION>.

 After rising during the morning session, share prices fell back in afternoon trading on the <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> Monday, while the dollar finished lower against the Japanese yen. The dollar closed at 126.00 yen, down 0.29 yen from its 126.29-yen finish on Thursday. After opening at 125.90 yen, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> currency ranged between 125.75 and 126.02 yen. The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, which hit a new high by gaining 56.70 points in the morning session, ended the day down 166.72 points, or 0.51 percent, at 32,285.77. The index had gained 140.56 points for a record 32,452.49-point closing on Thursday. Japanese financial markets were closed Friday because of the state funeral of Emperor <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>. Dealers said the <ORGANIZATION> Nikkei </ORGANIZATION> index fell because of profit taking. In currency dealings, the dollar's low opening followed its weakness in Friday's <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> trading, despite the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> action to raise its discount rate, dealers said. The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>'s rate hike dissappointed <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> financial markets because American market players had hoped it would go further than a half-percentage-point hike, said foreign exchange traders. The move was also seen as coming too late. <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> foreign exchange dealers were unimpressed as well. Traders said that a rate hike had been expected, and was fully discounted. Higher <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> interest rates tend to make the dollar more attractive to foreign investors, but Friday's <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> interest rate hike did not lead Japanese market players to the dollar-buying, said one dealer with a commercial bank in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>. Meanwhile, Japanese Finance Minister <PERSON> Tatsuo </PERSON> <PERSON> Murayama </PERSON> indicated Monday that there is no need for <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> to follow the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> discount rate hike with a rate hike of its own, <ORGANIZATION> Kyodo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> reported.

<HEAD>Duarte Agrees To Direct Negotiations With Rebels</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Napoleon </PERSON> <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON> has accepted leftist rebels' proposal to hold direct peace talks, calling for them to begin Tuesday in <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION> with a three-month cease-fire in place. In a nationwide television and radio address Sunday night, <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON> also addressed the guerrillas' offer to participate in and accept the results of the presidential election if it is postponed for at least four months. He advocated postponing the vote, which is scheduled for March 19, until April 30 and proposed that a referendum be held on the issue if the government and rebels can not resolve it in talks. <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON> did not say when such a plebiscite might take place. A meeting in <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION> would be the first direct negotiations since October 1987 between the U.S.-backed government and the insurgents it has been fighting for nine years. The last talks ended in stalemate. <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON>, 63, said he was proposing `` a new search to put an end to the armed conflict that is covering our country with blood,'' proposing that a cease-fire begin Tuesday and run at least through June 1. The civil war has killed an estimated 70,000 people, most of them civilians. There was no immediate comment from the rebels on <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON>'s proposal The <ORGANIZATION> Faribundo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marti </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, a revolutionary army of about 7,000 combatants, proposed last month that the presidential vote be put off until September. The offer was a dramatic turnabout and the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration said it was `` worthy of serious and substantive consideration.'' The rebels have boycotted and condemned all five previous national elections this decade, contending they have not been free and fair and were part of a U.S.-imposed plan to put a civilian facade on a military-dominated government. The insurgents, during talks with representatives of political parties in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> last week, indicated they would be willing to accept an election as early as July. They said they needed at least four months to shift from a military to an electoral campaign. The rebels also offered to lay down their arms if the country's armed forces were significantly cut and the police force reorganized <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON>, a Christian Democrat, said Sunday that the legislature should name three representatives to take part in the <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION> talks. He said the 13 parties should name one person to participate. He did not say if he would head the government delegation, nor how many members of the executive branch would take part. The legislature is controlled by the rightist <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nationalist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION>, or Arena, which is favored to win the presidential election. <PERSON> Arena </PERSON> has adamantly refused to accept any postponment of the vote. The army, the country's most powerful institution, also has said postponement of the election would be unconstitutional and threatened to take power if voting is postponed. When the guerrillas made their original proposal Jan. 24, <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON> said postponement of the elections beyond March 31 would be unconstitutional. The constitution says the vote must take place at least two months before the end of the incumbent's term, which is June 1. <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON> did not provide any explanation as to why April 30 would be any more constitutional than a later date. He reiterated that he would step down June 1. The legislature is empowered to name an interim president if there is no president-elect to take power June 1. The president, who suffers from terminal liver cancer, said the <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION> talks would intend to end the war, incorporate the rebels into the political sphere and achieve the recognition by the guerrillas of the government armed forces as the country's only legitimate military organization. The rebels said in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> that they would recognize the armed forces if it were reduced from its current strength of 56,000 to the 1980 level of 12,000. The insurgents also called for a restructuring and consolidation of the three separate police forces, and trial and punishment for officers responsible for gross violations of human rights. The army has staunchly protected its members from prosecution for human rights abuses.

 A failed lock may have caused a <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> jumbo jet's cargo door to pop open at 22,000 feet, ripping a huge hole up the side of the plane and sending nine passengers to their deaths, federal investigators say. Damage to the plane is consistent with the cargo door popping open under pressurization of the cabin as the jet gained altitude and atmospheric pressure outside the aircraft declined, investigators said late Saturday. `` We are focusing on and looking at the latching mechanism,'' said <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Dickinson </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> investigator. One cargo door latch attached to the fuselage was removed Sunday and will be compared to latches on other <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 747s, he said. The 10-by-10-foot cargo door has 10 latches, eight on the bottom and two on the sides, as well as two hook pins on each side. `` We're also trying to get a better handle on these latch pin supports and comparing them to others,'' <PERSON> Dickinson </PERSON> said. Asked whether it would be possible to determine the cause of the accident without the door, he said `` Obviously if we had the door it would be very helpful to us ... but there is other information that is helpful, `` he said. More than 70 investigators, including 16 from the <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION>, worked Sunday on finding the cause of the accident. But the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> suspended a sea and air search 100 miles south of <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION> after finding more debris from the plane. <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> Lt. <PERSON> Brad </PERSON> <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> said the search was hampered by high seas. `` There's probably not a lot more that can be picked up,'' he said. United Flight 811, carrying 354 people, had taken off Friday for <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION> and was about 100 miles from <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION> when the fuselage ripped open over the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION>. Nine passengers were sucked out and are presumed dead. The pilot lost power in one of the four engines and shut down another when a fire indicator light went on, but the plane returned safely to <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> announced Sunday that it had begun a series of special maintenance checks on its aircraft. <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON> said the maintenance checks are `` over and above -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION>'s -RRB- existing procedures and those required by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>.'' He also said an FAA-licensed mechanic will inspect each 747 cargo door after a landing and will oversee the closing of each 747 cargo door before departures. The closings have been handled by ramp personnel, his statement said. Two cutters returned to port Sunday morning with items recovered by then, including part of an overhead compartment, a section of fuselage and two seats. Also found were safety instruction cards and personal items including shoes and a teddy bear, said Lt. Cmdr. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Ellner </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> spokesman. No bodies have been found, officials said. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Marx </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION>'s senior metallurgist, said there was no evidence that metal fatigue _ weakness caused gradually by long-term use _ caused the hole in the 18-year-old jet, <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION>'s oldest <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 747. <PERSON> Marx </PERSON> said the hole's edge indicated that `` overstress'' _ a stress greater than the plane could stand _ had been placed on the aircraft, but he did not say what it might have been. `` If a door opened in flight, it could possibly cause overstress,'' <PERSON> Dickinson </PERSON> said in response to a question. <PERSON> Dickinson </PERSON> added that the condition could be caused by other factors he declined to explain. `` It's typical of an overload,'' <PERSON> Marx </PERSON> said. The hole follows the dimensions of the cargo door and flares farther up the aircraft, <PERSON> Dickinson </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Adminstration </ORGANIZATION> in July ordered airlines to improve cargo door lock systems on older <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 747s after a door in one plane partly opened in flight. The deadline for the work was the end of 1989. United had inspected all 25 of its jets covered by the order but had completed the required modifications on just six by last week, spokesman <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> <PERSON> Mack </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. The plane in last week's accident was not one of the six, he said <PERSON> Dickinson </PERSON> said the pilot and co-pilot told investigators Saturday there was no indication of trouble closing the cargo doors. <PERSON> Dickinson </PERSON> said a warning light in the cockpit would have indicated if the doors were not closed properly. The cargo door warning system worked when tested Sunday, but <PERSON> Dickinson </PERSON> said he did not know whether the pilot noticed the warning light when the cargo door ripped off. <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents searched the cargo area with dogs and found no evidence of explosives, <PERSON> Dickinson </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> explosive experts were sent home, he said Sunday. `` Nothing yet gives us any indication of a bomb in the cargo area, but we are not drawing any conclusions yet,'' he said. The missing passengers are: <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> and <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Morristown </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> <PERSON> Harley </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Hackensack </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Fallon </PERSON> and <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Fallon </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Handley </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Wellington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION>, and Dr. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Crawford </PERSON> and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Swann </PERSON>, both of <LOCATION> Sydney </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION> hospitals reported treating 27 people, mostly for minor injuries caused by flying debris. Three people remained hospitalized Sunday _ a 48-year-old flight attendant in fair condition with broken bones in her neck and upper back and abdominal injuries; a flight attendant in fair condition with a fractured arm; and a 73-year-old <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION> man in stable condition with heart problems.

<TEXT>
 A 12-year Marine Corps veteran should be dismissed because her association with lesbians made the corps look bad, a board of inquiry has ruled. Capt. <PERSON> Judy </PERSON> <PERSON> Meade </PERSON>'s friendships with lesbian women gave the impression `` that you yourself were a lesbian, -LRB- and -RRB- therefore brings discredit to yourself and the <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION>,'' Col. <PERSON> J.J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON> told <PERSON> Meade </PERSON> on Sunday. Ms. <PERSON> Meade </PERSON>, 36, testified last week that she is not a lesbian. The five-member board recommended that Ms. <PERSON> Meade </PERSON> be dismissed with an `` other than honorable'' discharge, which would mean the loss of normal discharge and retirement benefits. Ms. <PERSON> Meade </PERSON> declined to comment, but her civilian attorney, <PERSON> Vaughn </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>, called the hearing process unfair. A board of inquiry hearing differs from a court martial, which is similar to a civilian trial, in that five Marine colonels hear the presentation of the government against the accused and then make a decision. The board has a legal adviser available. The opinion is automatically reviewed by the commanding general, and then the <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Review </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. `` We wish they had court-martialed <PERSON> Judy </PERSON> <PERSON> Meade </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> said. `` ... The evidence the government presented would have never been admitted in court. It would have not been been allowed under the rules of evidence.'' Most of the allegations against <PERSON> Meade </PERSON> stemmed from a February 1988 visit she made to the home of a <LOCATION> Beaufort </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION>, woman. Government witnesses said they had seen <PERSON> Meade </PERSON> and the woman in bed together. Both <PERSON> Meade </PERSON> and the woman testified they had never had sexual contact. Prosecutor Capt. <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dougherty </PERSON> argued the incident was enough to constitute conduct unbecoming an officer because some enlisted women also visiting the house saw the women in bed together. `` The board's responsibility is not to make a moral judgment on Capt. <PERSON> Judy </PERSON> <PERSON> Meade </PERSON>'s life,'' he said. `` It's to ask you to uphold the standards of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> is a way of life. She has n't adopted it.'' The board said Ms. <PERSON> Meade </PERSON> had failed to report suspected lesbian activity, and had misled her superior officers by withholding information that the other woman was a lesbian. Eighteen women at <LOCATION> Parris </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION>, the only <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> boot camp where women go for basic training, have been discharged for homosexual behavior and court-martialed under charges of sodomy and indecent acts.

 In a boxy little house on a trim suburban street, police believe mild-mannered engineer <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Starrett </PERSON>, perhaps under the influence of porn-fueled fantasies, assaulted young women while his wife was away. He has admitted, police say, to kidnapping and assaulting three girls, killing one of them, and assaulting four others in <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>. Police in five other states want to talk to him. When police earlier this month searched <PERSON> Starrett </PERSON>'s rented storage unit, a mile from his house, they found 935 pornographic books and magazines depicting sexual bondage, horror scenes and nudity. They also found criminology textbooks and books about serial killer <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON>, who preyed on attractive young women. And police said they found about 100 videotapes, some of which were of <PERSON> Starrett </PERSON>'s sexual assaults. `` He was, to his neighbors, a quiet, reserved, working businessman, a family man,'' says <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Sheriff <PERSON> Otis </PERSON> <PERSON> Hensley </PERSON>. `` And there were no suspicions by any -LRB- fellow -RRB- employees, or not even suspicion by his family.'' <PERSON> Starrett </PERSON>, 29, a design engineer, came to authorities' attention Feb. 10, when a 17-year-old girl, who vanished four days earlier from her <LOCATION> Lexington </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION>, home, ran to a house on <PERSON> Starrett </PERSON>'s street She told the occupants she had been imprisoned in <PERSON> Starrett </PERSON>'s home for four days _ often in handcuffs _ and that she had been sexually assaulted. Three days later, police near <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> found <PERSON> Starrett </PERSON> asleep behind the wheel of his flashy red Camaro. Now, he's charged with kidnapping the 17-year-old, a 12-year-old and 15-year-old <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> <PERSON> McCrea </PERSON>, all of whom vanished from <LOCATION> Lexington </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, about 50 miles north of <LOCATION> Martinez </LOCATION> on Interstate 20. The 17-year-old and the 12-year-old survived; the youngest girl was returned to her home shortly after she disappeared last June. <PERSON> Starrett </PERSON> faces false imprisonment, sodomy and child molestation charges in those cases. Miss <PERSON> McCrea </PERSON>, who disappeared in December, was shot to death. Police say <PERSON> Starrett </PERSON> led them to her body, and they plan to charge him with murder. <PERSON> Starrett </PERSON> also has admitted attacks on two women near <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, one near <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION>, and one near <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Hensley </PERSON> said. Charges against him are pending in all three locations. Police say they still do n't know why he did it, why he's decided to talk about it or what other crimes he might have committed. `` This was just one of those situations where law enforcement did not have the clairvoyance to know something that even his own family members were unaware of,'' <PERSON> Hensley </PERSON> said. Police say <PERSON> Starrett </PERSON>, who worked at the <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> nuclear power plant just across the border in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, was careful to keep his two lives separate, with his dark side hidden from his wife, <PERSON> Michelle </PERSON>. The crimes apparently occurred while she was making regular visits to <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, police said. Soon after the 17-year-old's escape, a bizarre picture began to emerge. <PERSON> Hensley </PERSON> says <PERSON> Starrett </PERSON> apparently chose at least some of his victims by going to the homes of people who had placed classified ads in newspapers, trying to sell merchandise. He abducted girls he found home alone, police said. The 17-year-old's family, for example, was trying to sell a water bed. The want-ad connection `` is pretty much similar in all the cases we looked at,'' says <PERSON> Hensley </PERSON>. Within days, police in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> were considering <PERSON> Starrett </PERSON> as a possible suspect in unsolved abductions or sexual assaults in their states. One of the managers at the storage warehouse complex where <PERSON> Starrett </PERSON> rented a unit said she was surprised by <PERSON> Starrett </PERSON>'s arrest and that it seemed uncharacteristic. `` He was more or less quiet. He never said too much when he came in,'' said <PERSON> Paula </PERSON> <PERSON> Snellings </PERSON>, co-manager of the Van Guard warehouse. `` I never would have imagined he would do something like that,'' she said. `` He was just too straight acting. He dressed neat, he drove a pretty car.''

 Temperatures were climbing back toward the 70s and the price of produce also was expected to go up because of damage from a record-breaking cold snap. `` I had a fellow with 500 acres of cucumbers and peppers in south Hillsborough -LRB- <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> -RRB- call me this morning to tell me that they're completely gone,'' said <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Burgin </PERSON>, a produce broker in <LOCATION> Plant </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> At the wholesale level, <PERSON> Burgin </PERSON> said, a bushel of peppers that cost $ 7 to $ 8 last week probably will cost him $ 25 to $ 30 and will come from <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> or the West. <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s produce industry is estimated at more than $ 1.1 billion annually, compared with the $ 1.3 billion-a-year citrus industry that appeared to have suffered only minimal damage from the cold wave that arrived Thursday. Unseasonably warm weather earlier this winter contributed to losses because it induced farmers to plant early, said <PERSON> Reggie </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, spokesman for Orlando-based <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fruit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Vegetable </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. `` From talking with several growers yesterday, we did experience quite a bit of damage on the real cold-sensitive crops _ cucumbers, watermelons and squash _ and some damage on peppers and tomato crops,'' he said Sunday. He said he expected the crop loss would be up to 30 percent of potential yield. `` What I see is a disaster,'' <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Harloff </PERSON>, a Palmetto tomato grower and packer, said Saturday as he stood in a 1,000-acre tract of young plants. About three-quarters of the plants were dead and blackening in the bright sunlight. They had been exposed to 26-degree temperatures for more than four hours that morning. `` We're all about in the same boat down here,'' <PERSON> Harloff </PERSON> said. Tomatoes are the state's largest produce crop, valued at almost $ 490 million in 1987, the latest figures available. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Butler </PERSON> said the damage was the worst in the 10 years he's worked at <ORGANIZATION> Ruskin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Vegetable </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which ships fresh produce to some of the largest grocery store chains and terminal markets in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> `` Our main suit is tomatoes,'' said <PERSON> Butler </PERSON>, general manager of the Hillsborough company. `` The damage to the tomato crop was considerable. I've seen a lot of kill today. I've seen total loss in some fields, and just a little bit in a few fields because they were close to the -LRB- warming -RRB- water, but I've seen at least some damage in every field, up to total destruction.''

 A governor says forcible repatriation may be necessary to stem a tide of job-seekers who have been left stranded and homeless by the thousands in his southern <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> province, an official report said today. Governor <PERSON> Ye </PERSON> <PERSON> Xuanping </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Guangdong </LOCATION> province described the situation as a `` labor wave washing in from surrounding provinces,'' the official <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said. He has told all cities and counties in the province to form teams to try to persuade new arrivals to go home, the report said. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s migrant workers, estimated as high as 20 million, are a by-product of the nation's easing of travel restrictions and its market-oriented reforms, which have encouraged labor mobility. <LOCATION> Guangdong </LOCATION>, located next to <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> and one of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s most prosperous provinces, is the main Chinese mecca for urban job-seekers. However, <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION> also is reported to have a `` floating population'' of 2 million, and more than 1 million non-residents are temporarily staying in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. Today's report said more than 2.5 million people have poured into <LOCATION> Guangdong </LOCATION> looking for work since the Lunar New Year holiday ended two weeks ago. Governor <PERSON> Ye </PERSON> was quoted as saying forced repatriation might be necessary. He ordered all government and private enterprises to immediately stop hiring new arrivals from other provinces. The agency said thousands of people are sleeping at railway stations, wharves or on the street, mainly in the provincial capital of <LOCATION> Canton </LOCATION>. Hundreds of thousands more are arriving every day or waiting at train stations in other provinces for passage to <LOCATION> Guangdong </LOCATION>, the report said. Transport and hygiene have been strained to the limit, crime is up, and begging is expected to rise, the report said. Some of the jobless new arrivals are trying to make a living by picking up trash in the streets, the agency said.

<TEXT>
 A Quaker group wants the town to challenge <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Defense Department-funded anthrax research at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION>, maintaining it could be used in germ warfare. `` We are committed to eradicating the research from the campus,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Bonifaz </PERSON>, who heads the effort by the local chapter of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Friends </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. Anthrax is an infectious disease contracted by wild and domesticated animals, especially cattle and sheep. It is caused by a bacterium and can be transmitted to people. The town <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> has scheduled a public hearing Thursday on the group's claim that the 23-year-old research project poses a health threat not only to <LOCATION> Amherst </LOCATION>, but the nation as a whole, because of its possible military uses, said <ORGANIZATION> Town </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> Director <PERSON> Bettye </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> <PERSON> Frederic </PERSON>. The chief scientist on the research project, <PERSON> Curtis </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Thorne </PERSON>, has maintained his work on the basic structure of the bacterium is aimed at finding a vaccine for the disease. For the past nine years, his work has been financed by grants, totaling about $ 1 million from the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, under its <ORGANIZATION> Biological </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> project, according to <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Langley </PERSON>, assistant vice chancellor for university relations and development. Prior to that it was funded by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION>, he said. <PERSON> Diana </PERSON> <PERSON> Stein </PERSON>, a member of the town <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> who has questioned the board's involvement in the dispute, said that because the un-classified research is being openly published it could help all countries find an anthrax vaccine, eventually rendering useless any biological weapons using the bacteria. The university, which has been pressured by the Quaker group to dump the research, had not commented on the issue until late last week when Chancellor <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Duffey </PERSON> strongly defended <PERSON> Thorne </PERSON>'s work. `` As a public institution we will respond to responsible questions or concerns, but we do not intend to modify policies in response to threats or demands,'' <PERSON> Duffey </PERSON> said. `` As long as the scope, methods and results of research are fully and freely disseminated, we will protect the right of our faculty to conduct research of their own choosing.'' `` Unfortunately, two very distinct issues have been presented as one concern by the <ORGANIZATION> AFSC </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Duffey </PERSON> said. `` The first _ the issue of public safety _ can be dealt with simply and straightforwardly. The anthrax research conducted at the university poses no danger to the health or safety of the researcher, the university or the local community. Professor <PERSON> Thorne </PERSON> has conducted this research for 23 years without a single incident or safety violation.'' <PERSON> Duffey </PERSON> said the second issue of whether the university should conduct research supported by the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> `` should be discussed on its own merits and not in the context of an effort to frighten people with unfounded allegations about threats to public health and without imputing false motives to the university or Professor <PERSON> Thorne </PERSON>.'' He said a variety of research including some `` very basic scientific investigation'' is currently being funded by the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. `` Our policies in this area are guided by action taken by the <ORGANIZATION> Faculty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and the university's <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trustees </ORGANIZATION>,'' he said. `` Those policies do not prohibit members from the faculty from undertaking research so long as the scope, methods and results can be fully and freely disclosed. We intend to abide by and defend this policy.''

 Jailed black nationalist leader <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> has told his wife to make no further public statements on the scandal over her bodyguards that has seriously tarnished her image, her lawyer says. The imprisoned <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> leader gave <PERSON> Winnie </PERSON> <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> the instructions at a meeting Sunday of more than three hours at Victor Verster Prison outside <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION>, said her lawyer, <PERSON> Essa </PERSON> <PERSON> Moosa </PERSON>. She did not speak to waiting journalists when she left the prison, and <PERSON> Moosa </PERSON> declined to comment on other details Sunday. The controversy has prompted major anti-apartheid groups to denounce Mrs. <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>, herself a prominent activist. Anti-apartheid groups say the bodyguards, known as the <ORGANIZATION> Mandela </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> soccer club, waged a `` reign of terror'' in <LOCATION> Soweto </LOCATION>, the black township outside <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION>, and have renounced Mrs. <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> for ignoring their appeals that she disband the group. Four people with links to Mrs. <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> and her bodyguards have been killed in the past two months and two bodyguards have been charged with murdering one of them, 14-year-old activist <PERSON> Stompie </PERSON> <PERSON> Seipei </PERSON>. Mrs. <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> has denied any wrongdoing and claims the scandal stems from a plot to discredit her. She has given brief interviews to a few journalists but has not held a news conference or issued statements to explain her role in the controversy. Mrs. <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> visited her husband Feb. 15 and decided to act on his instruction to disband the soccer club and remove team members from her house. Anti-apartheid groups have emphasized they still support <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>, the country's most revered black nationalist leader. <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> has been in jail since 1962, sentenced to life on sabotage and sedition charges. Mrs. <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>, a trained social worker, formed <ORGANIZATION> Mandela </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> in 1986, saying she wanted to organize activities for youths congregating on streets near her house. But the group, numbering as many as 30, grew into an unofficial force of bodyguards who seldom played soccer and have often antagonized members of the community. The controversy came to a head last month when three young men told a <LOCATION> Soweto </LOCATION> community meeting the bodyguards abducted them from a church residence, took them to Mrs. <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>'s home and beat them. A fourth person, <PERSON> Seipei </PERSON>, received a more severe beating, said the men, who contended Mrs. <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> `` was involved in the events.'' <PERSON> Seipei </PERSON>'s decomposed body was found, throat slit, on Jan. 7 in a <LOCATION> Soweto </LOCATION> field. The teen-ager was a well-known activist, despite his youth, and was eulogized at his funeral Saturday as a hero of the anti-apartheid movement. Under apartheid, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s 28 million blacks have no vote in national affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and maintain separate districts, schools and health services.

<TEXT>
 A bomb blast killed a guard outside a British cultural center, and a police officer linked the attack to Moslem protests over British author <PERSON> Salman </PERSON> <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>'s novel `` The Satanic Verses.'' The two-pound bomb exploded Sunday night while the city's British-run library was closed, police said on condition of anonymity It killed 65-year-old guard <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Shafi </PERSON>, demolished the building's guard room and damaged the outside wall. Police had earlier said the building housed the British Consulate, but British diplomats said those offices are elsewhere. Asked whether the blast was connected to the furor over <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>'s novel, one officer said, `` It appears that way. Many Moslems are outraged by <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>'s novel, which they say blasphemes their religion, and Moslem countries including <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> have banned it. Six people died and scores more were injured when a mob attacked an American cultural center Feb. 12 in the capital, <LOCATION> Islamabad </LOCATION>, to demand that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> ban the book. Two days later, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s fundamentalist leader <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> called on Moslems to seek out and kill <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> and his publishers.

 A <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> Flight 811 passenger says he cheated death by switching seats in the jumbo jet shortly before a huge chunk of the fuselage tore off in flight, sweeping nine people to their deaths. `` That really saved my life. I think I ended up with the safest seat on the whole plane,'' said <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Rij </PERSON>, 70, of <LOCATION> Christchurch </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Rij </PERSON>, a dairy industry consultant, said he usually travels business class, and likes to sit in the upper deck. He said he could not get an upper deck seat on the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> flight from <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, but was told to check in early at <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> before Friday's flight to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION> to switch from the main deck. <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Rij </PERSON> said he was given a window seat on the left side of the upper deck of the <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 747-400. About 45 minutes into the flight, he said, `` we heard this loud bang and then it was like a huge storm. The noise was really tremendous. ... `` Pieces of the cabin were flying around. It's very hard to describe. I'm sure I wold have died in that other seat.'' <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Rij </PERSON> said he did n't realize until the plane returned safely to <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION> about 15 minutes later that a huge hole had been ripped in the right side, and that the nine people sucked out of the plane had been sitting in business class on the main deck. As the plane descended toward <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Rij </PERSON> said he thought of the hundreds who died aboard the Titanic, then prayed and remembered the words to the hymn `` Nearer My God To Thee.'' `` We all thought that was the finish. You do n't handle those things yourself. You rely on God,'' he said. Twenty-seven others were hospitalized, although all but <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Rij </PERSON> and two others, were released by Sunday. <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Rij </PERSON>, who said he underwent heart bypass surgery several years ago, was hospitalized at the Queen's <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> for observation after suffering chest pain. <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Rij </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Adrian </PERSON>, 69, flew to <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION> on Saturday. He said their six children have been checking on him by telephone. Although he marveled at his luck, another man who tried to get a seat on the upper deck was not so lucky, <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Rij </PERSON> said. Two people claimed to have a boarding pass for the same seat, and after an argument, one went downstairs to the main deck, <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Rij </PERSON> said. Without knowing the passenger's name, <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> said it could not confirm his fate. <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Rij </PERSON> said he is not afraid to fly again, even though this is his second near miss. In 1948, he was supposed to fly to <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, for a dairy products exhibition but became ill and could not travel. The flight he had booked crashed, killing everyone aboard, he said.

<HEAD>A Brilliant Cavalcade of Broadway Dances in `Jerome Robbins' Broadway'</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: ADDS three grafs with other New York reviews. No PMs planned.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL KUCHWARA</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
 Twenty-five years ago when dancing rather than complicated, computerized scenery was the stuff that made musicals move, <PERSON> Jerome </PERSON> <PERSON> Robbins </PERSON> was the king of Broadway. Now the king has come back to reclaim his throne with `` <PERSON> Jerome </PERSON> <PERSON> Robbins </PERSON>' Broadway,'' a dazzling retrospective of dances and other numbers from the musicals he helped bring to life from 1944 to 1964. That list includes such classics as `` West Side Story,'' `` Gypsy,'' `` Fiddler on the Roof,'' `` The King and I,'' `` Peter Pan'' and `` On the Town.'' The production, which opened Sunday at Broadway's Imperial Theater, is not a revival. It's a brilliant distillation of the past, reconstructed and rethought with the utmost precision and care by <PERSON> Robbins </PERSON> and a team of assistants that includes such veteran Broadway dancers as <PERSON> Grover </PERSON> <PERSON> Dale </PERSON>, <PERSON> Cynthia </PERSON> <PERSON> Onrubia </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>. <PERSON> Robbins </PERSON> and his cast of 62 dancers demonstrate why the musical, particularly the American musical, was, and still can be, exhilarating. There's nothing else quite like it _ <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Pan </PERSON> soaring over the rooftops of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, the swagger and shock of the <ORGANIZATION> Sharks </ORGANIZATION> and Jets crossing switchblades, Tevye expounding on the importance of `` Tradition'' or a dizzy <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION> that has flappers falling to the floor and still continuing to dance. All are part of `` <PERSON> Jerome </PERSON> <PERSON> Robbins </PERSON>' Broadway'' but the evening opens sentimentally with a trio of numbers from `` On the Town,'' <PERSON> Robbins </PERSON>' first show. `` On the Town'' tells the story of three sailors out on a 24-hour spree in World War II <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. But it's a story told not only through dialogue and song but through dance, too. It combines elements of ballet with the brash, brassy and confident style of popular dance. It's a technique that <PERSON> Robbins </PERSON> perfected more than a decade later in `` West Side Story.'' For `` <PERSON> Jerome </PERSON> <PERSON> Robbins </PERSON>' Broadway,'' he has put together a 30-minute suite of dances from this <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> <PERSON> Bernstein-Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Sondheim </PERSON> musical, and it is the emotional and physical heart of the show. Comprised of sections from `` The Prologue,'' `` The Rumble,'' `` Cool,'' `` <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' `` The Dance Hall'' and `` Somewhere,'' the suite compresses the entire modern-day story of <PERSON> Romeo </PERSON> and <PERSON> Juliet </PERSON> into quite simply the best choreography now on <LOCATION> Broadway </LOCATION>. And the dancers attack it with a ferocity that is astounding. There is an unnerving, on-the-edge menace to their work. When the rival Sharks and Jets square off, the feeling is electric. The audience gasps when <PERSON> Bernardo </PERSON> knifes Riff, and the hero <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> inevitably gets drawn into the tragedy. The `` West Side Story'' suite features ensemble dancing at its very best, but special praise must go to <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Wise </PERSON> as the cocky Riff, <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Garr </PERSON> who is a murderous <PERSON> Bernardo </PERSON> and <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> La </PERSON> <PERSON> Fosse </PERSON> as a poignant, even poetic <PERSON> Tony </PERSON>. Another side to <PERSON> Robbins </PERSON> also is revealed in this show. The man can be funny, not above using a pratfall, a bawdy joke or just plain corn to get a laugh. All of those elements come together in `` Comedy Tonight,'' the opening number of the 1962 musical `` A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum.'' <PERSON> Robbins </PERSON> devised it when `` Forum'' was in trouble out of town. The song's humor set the tone for the entire musical and helped make it a hit in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. The number gets just as many laughs now with <PERSON> Jason </PERSON> <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> playing the Zero Mostel role. <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON>, a pudgy-faced performer, serves as narrator for `` <PERSON> Jerome </PERSON> <PERSON> Robbins </PERSON>' Broadway'' as well as an occasional participant in the proceedings. Whether soft-shoeing his way through `` I Still Get Jealous,'' a beguiling <PERSON> Jule </PERSON> <PERSON> Styne </PERSON> melody from `` High Button Shoes,'' or playing Tevye in `` Fiddler on the Roof,'' <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> has all the right moves. <PERSON> Robbins </PERSON> has constructed the show so it starts slowly, building to the powerful `` West Side Story'' segment at the end of the first act. But the pace does n't let up in Act 2. <PERSON> Robbins </PERSON> begins the second act with `` The Small House of Uncle <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>,'' the charming ballet retelling of `` Uncle <PERSON> Tom </PERSON>'s Cabin'' from `` The King and I.'' East meets West, and <PERSON> Robbins </PERSON> is the interpreter, blending Oriental dance technique with Broadway razzle-dazzle. The original setting, designed by <PERSON> Jo </PERSON> <PERSON> Mielziner </PERSON>, and the striking and colorful Siamese costumes by <PERSON> Irene </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharaff </PERSON>, turn it into the most visually stunning of the production numbers. What makes <PERSON> Robbins </PERSON> so special is the scope of his inventiveness. He can go from the king of <LOCATION> Siam </LOCATION> to the queen of burlesque without missing a beat. He follows `` Uncle Thomas'' with `` You Got ta Have a Gimmick,'' the hilarious advice given by three strippers to <PERSON> Baby </PERSON> <PERSON> Louise </PERSON>, the young performer who eventually peels down to become <PERSON> Gypsy </PERSON> <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>. Then he stops everything with `` On a Sunday by the Sea'' from `` High Button Shoes.'' It's a dizzy, raucous ballet involving a bag of stolen money, a chorus line of bathing beauties, <ORGANIZATION> Keystone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kops </ORGANIZATION>, two sets of identical twins and even a gorilla. The action never stops and neither does the laughter. There's a double edge to the joy of `` <PERSON> Jerome </PERSON> <PERSON> Robbins </PERSON>' Broadway.'' If the musical celebrates the past, it also shows up the paucity of the present. Choreography has disappeared on Broadway today. Can anybody remember the dancing in `` The Phantom of the Opera,'' `` <LOCATION> Les </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Miserables </LOCATION>,'' `` The Mystery of <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Drood </PERSON>'' and `` Big River,'' the last four <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> award-winning musicals? With the deaths of <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Fosse </PERSON> and Gower Champion, <PERSON> Robbins </PERSON> is the last of the great Broadway choreographers. The best news about his latest show is that the man may be working on a new theatrical work. Judging from the riches to be found in `` <PERSON> Jerome </PERSON> <PERSON> Robbins </PERSON>' Broadway,'' let's hope the rumor is true. In other <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> reviews: <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Rich </PERSON> writes in The <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Times: `` While ` <PERSON> Jerome </PERSON> <PERSON> Robbins </PERSON>'s Broadway' may celebrate a vanished musical theater, it does so with such youthful exuberance that nostalgia finally gives way to a giddy, perhaps not even foolish, dream that a new generation of Broadway babies may yet be born.'' <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Kissel </PERSON> writes in the Daily News: `` The evening pays tribute to an ego that is apparently as huge as the talent behind it ... From the tone of the show you would never know musical theater was about collaboration.''

<HEAD>Prime Minister Acknowledges Japanese Aggression in World War II</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 In a reversal of his earlier remark on <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s role in World War II, Prime Minister <PERSON> Noboru </PERSON> <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> said Monday there was no denying <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> was an aggressor in the conflict. `` It is regrettable that my unsatisfactory remark invited criticism'' from other <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> countries, <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> said during a parliamentary budget committee session. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> had been especially indignant. <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> resumed business after a week's recess for the funeral of Emperor <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>, whose death has renewed debate and national soul-searching over <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s role in World War II. <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> said today that <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> caused grave damage to neighboring countries through the war. `` There is no denying our country's aggressive actions during the war,'' he said. In a Feb. 18 parliamentary committee session, <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> said the question of whether <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> was an aggressor in World War II would have to be decided by future historians. The remark touched off sharp criticism from countries that suffered brutal invasions by <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> before and during the war. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s Foreign Minister <PERSON> Qian </PERSON> <PERSON> Qichen </PERSON>, who attended the emperor's funeral, urged the Japanese government to cease promulgating what he said he viewed as distortions of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s militaristic past <PERSON> Qian </PERSON> met Friday with both <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> and Foreign Minister Sousuke Uno. Italian and Soviet newspapers have also accused <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> of evading the issue of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s wartime aggression and failing to draw lessons from history. The question of war responsibility is sensitive in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> because of debate over the personal role of the late emperor. Many historians say the monarch was a figurehead during World War II, powerless against the military Cabinet. Two Cabinet ministers were forced to step down in 1986 and 1988 after they said <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s wartime actions were justifiable and did not constitute aggression.

 Radical students yelling `` <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> go home'' battled riot police with firebombs and rocks in at least six cities today to protest the president's visit to <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> and demand the withdrawal of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces. About 700 radical students battled riot police around <ORGANIZATION> Dongguk </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> when they were blocked from marching to the downtown <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Embassy by hundreds of riot police in green combat fatigues and visored helmets. `` Yankees go home'' and `` Down with military dictatorship,'' students armed with steel pipes and clubs screamed as they hurled showers of firebombs and rocks at lines of police blocking the street. No serious injuries or arrests were reported during the 45-minute clash. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> for a five-hour visit on his way home from <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, moved around the capital by helicopter and was nowhere near the violence. The government had mobilized 20,000 riot police in central <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> to block protests during his visit. Radical students protesting <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s visit clashed with police in at least five provincial cities, including the southern city of <LOCATION> Kwangju </LOCATION>, where about 3,000 police engaged hundreds of students in street battles. Riot police drove off students who tried to protest outside the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> base at <LOCATION> Kunsan </LOCATION> south of <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>, and clashes were also reported in <LOCATION> Taegu </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pusan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Chongju </LOCATION>. Outside <ORGANIZATION> Dungguk </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, riot police fired tear-gas bombs with rifles into groups of students or pelted them at close range with tear-gas grenades. Several officers were set on fire after being hit by firebombs, but the flames were quickly extinguished. Students burned effigies of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and President <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> Tae-woo at a rally on the school grounds before marching out toward the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Embassy about three miles away. Marchers beating drums led the procession. During the rally, radical leaders denounced <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, charging that <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> keeps troops in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> to enforce its rule. Earlier in the day, riot police broke up an attempt by dissident leaders to march to the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> to deliver a letter addressed to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> demanding withdrawal of the 42,000 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops based in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> under a mutual defense treaty. About 15 prominent dissidents shouting slogans and carrying pictures of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> with red crosses drawn through them were seized and hauled away after trying to assemble about a block from the embassy. `` No <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> visit,'' the small band shouted before they were overwhelmed by charging police, who kicked and punched some of the protesters. Dissident groups claimed 32 people were arrested today protesting the visit. Police said there had been arrests, but gave no figures. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s helicopter passed overhead minutes after a protest on its way to the nearby presidential mansion, the <ORGANIZATION> Blue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, where <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> met <PERSON> Roh </PERSON>. Hundreds of riot police ringed the embassy and other <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> facilites because of radicals' threats to hold nationwide anti-American protests. Riot police were also posted at <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> army bases to prevent attacks. The letter to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, released earlier by the nation's main dissident alliance, denounced the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> as the main source of division and strife in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. It called for withdrawal of all <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces from <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> and charged that <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> rules the country like a colony. `` U.S.A. is the source of all suppression and sorrow to <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> people since the division of the <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> peninsula,'' the letter said. The letter accused <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> of dividing the <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> peninsula and keeping troops in the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> to prevent reunification with communist <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. It also denounced <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> for seeking greater access for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> imports to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. The letter also said the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> visit helps <PERSON> Roh </PERSON>, who they want to oust. Radicals claim <PERSON> Roh </PERSON>'s government is a military dictatorship controlled by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Radical students have little public support because of their violence and extremism, but can assemble thousands of activists and often clash with riot police in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> and other cities.

<HEAD>Chinese Form Environmental Group to Fight Dam</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN POMFRET</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A group of journalists and engineers are fighting a huge dam project on the <LOCATION> Yangtze </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, marking the first time Chinese intellectuals have united for an environmental cause. The group, which is to hold its first news conference Tuesday, has published a book criticizing the Three Gorges Hydroelectric Project, a 15,000-megawatt facility that would be the largest water power project in the world. The book represents the first time Chinese journalists have worked together `` based on their conscience, not on what the state-run press has told them to do,'' said <PERSON> Dai </PERSON> <PERSON> Qing </PERSON>, editor of the book prepared by journalists from the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> and other leading publications. Ms. <PERSON> Dai </PERSON>, an editor at the prestigious Guangming Daily, said she organized opposition because huge industrial projects `` need to be discussed by all of society, not just by a few men in a ministry somewhere.'' She said all the journalists and engineers participating in the group are worried about <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s environment, which has deteriorated rapidly during the past 10 years of swift economic growth. Her comments also come as an increasing number of Chinese intellectuals are challenging the government's monopoly on decision-making power. `` Since the 1949 revolution, my country has undertaken thousands of mistaken projects,'' she said. `` But you would think that in a planned economy, things would be carried out scientifically. That's not the case in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. In the 1950s and 1960s, she said, industrial projects were pushed on their political merits. Indeed, opponents of the Three Gorges project were branded as `` rightists'' in political campaigns in those days. Now, government ministries compete for scarce resources for their projects, paying little heed to the interests of the nation as a whole, she said. `` It may be less political, but the behavior is just as harmful to the country,'' she said. Ms. <PERSON> Dai </PERSON> said she realized she was risking her job and possibly her future by openly voicing her opinion. `` But that does n't bother me,'' she said. `` I can not keep silent.'' Since the Communist revolution, Chinese politicians have been considering a plan to build a 610-foot dam on the <LOCATION> Yangtze </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> near the border of <LOCATION> Sichuan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hubei </LOCATION> provinces in central <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. The dam would block the famous Three Gorges, covering forever the vistas celebrated on Chinese scroll paintings for centuries. The project would tame the perennial floods of the mighty <LOCATION> Yangtze </LOCATION>, the third longest river in the world after the Nile and the <LOCATION> Amazon </LOCATION>. It also would provide energy to nearby cities like Chunking, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s biggest urban center with 16 million people. Factories in Chunking are idle at least 20 percent of the time because they lack power. In January, it looked like the project would be delayed five years, when <PERSON> Vice-Premier </PERSON> <PERSON> Yao </PERSON> <PERSON> Yilin </PERSON> said economic difficulties would hold up the plan. But last week, backers of the project held a news conference and said <PERSON> Yao </PERSON> was only expressing his personal opinion. The project would have to tackle massive problems. About 1 million people will have to be moved to make room for a huge reservoir containing 5.19 trillion gallons of water, according to a <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> scientist who has worked on the project for several decades. The dam is planned for an area prone to earthquakes. `` One jolt and <LOCATION> Wuhan </LOCATION> -LRB- a major industrial center east of the planned dam -RRB-, will be wiped out,'' said the scientist, who spoke on condition of anonymity. Finally, much of the land around the dam has been deforested by peasants seeking wood for their homes and for energy. `` We fear the dam will turn the center of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> into a big mud puddle,'' he said. `` The damage to the environment could be catastrophic.'' In the face of the problems, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> has asked for foreign advice. In 1980, an American team of engineers said the project was so dangerous it `` would be like putting an atomic bomb on <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s head,'' according to Chinese documents obtained here The engineers' report says <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> should concentrate on tapping the sparsely populated upper reaches of the <LOCATION> Yangtze </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> for power. It also raises concerns about the destruction of the Three Gorges, the <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> equivalent of <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s Grand Canyon.

 <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> <PERSON> Tipton </PERSON> kept to himself as his jazz trio toured the West. He never went swimming in the motel pools. Waiting for a call from the group's manager, he'd say, or did n't want to burn his fair skin. He stayed in a separate room, and did n't talk much about childhood or family life. When he did talk, he'd say he came from a broken home and was sent to live with an aunt. Drummer <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Neill </PERSON> considered <PERSON> Tipton </PERSON> to be his best friend, but even he was shocked at what the saxophone and piano player had been hiding. `` <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> <PERSON> Tipton </PERSON> was a biological female,'' pathologist <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Lindholm </PERSON> said after an autopsy on <PERSON> Tipton </PERSON>, who died Jan. 21 from a bleeding ulcer. Interviews with family, friends, colleagues and jazz aficionados shed little light on <PERSON> Tipton </PERSON>'s early years; even her age is uncertain. <PERSON> Kitty </PERSON> <PERSON> Oakes </PERSON>, who lived as <PERSON> Tipton </PERSON>'s wife after 1960 until they separated about 10 years ago, told a funeral home <PERSON> Tipton </PERSON> was born Dec. 29, 1914, in <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> and was raised in <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo </LOCATION>. But no birth certificate has been found. What is known is that <PERSON> Tipton </PERSON>, a saxophone and piano player who liked to write vocal arrangements, performed with the <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Teagarden </PERSON>, <PERSON> Russ </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlyle </PERSON> and <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Cameron </PERSON> bands before forming the <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> <PERSON> Tipton </PERSON> Trio in the 1950s. `` He gave up everything,'' <PERSON> Oakes </PERSON>, who adopted three sons with <PERSON> Tipton </PERSON>, told The <ORGANIZATION> Spokesman-Review </ORGANIZATION> newspaper. `` There were certain rules and regulations in those days if you were going to be a musician.'' But jazz experts, including several women who played in bands in the 1930s, said that while there was discrimination, they doubted that a talented musician would have had to pose as a man to make it in the industry. They point to <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Lou </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> and others who became famous as jazz musicians and composers. `` When I first started, I was skipped over unless they could n't get anybody else,'' said pianist <PERSON> Norma </PERSON> <PERSON> Teagarden </PERSON>, sister of <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Teagarden </PERSON> `` At that time, it was hard to break in with a band, especially if you played saxophone. `` There was a lot of resistance. There were not many women in that business anyway. You've got to be on the road so much, you ca n't very well be married, unless your husband was one of the group.'' `` I was a piano player and did n't have any problems'' joining a jazz band, she said. Having three brothers who were established musicians probably helped, said Ms. <PERSON> Teagarden </PERSON>, who performs in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> two nights a week. <PERSON> Marion </PERSON> <PERSON> McPartland </PERSON>, a jazz pianist who hosts a <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> jazz show, said, `` It's such a strange story, I do n't feel it any part of my own career. I ca n't identify with somebody doing something like that. `` There were many women jazz players around, in lots of bands ... I can only say that I've been fortunate in that I've never even had the feeling of hopelessness she had to do a thing like that,'' <PERSON> McPartland </PERSON> said. `` The bands were mostly men and I would think in the 1930s, where they were on the road doing one-nighters a lot, having a woman on the bus ... had a sort of inhibiting effect on the language used, and so on,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Stanley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dance </ORGANIZATION>, who has written eight books on jazz musicians. `` From that point of view, a lot of males would not welcome the woman. `` Still, it seems a little bit extraordinary to have done that.'' `` It certainly was unusual to find a white woman playing piano in jazz bands,'' said <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, a jazz critic. `` I do n't think that society was really well prepared for -LRB- women jazz players -RRB-. Even jazz, which was as liberal a society as you could find, there was n't that much integration. <PERSON> O'Neill </PERSON> said the clamor over the role reversal overshadows the fact that <PERSON> Tipton </PERSON> was a fine musician with a keen sense of humor. <PERSON> Tipton </PERSON>'s baby face and high voice prompted some cracks in nightclubs, but the drummer said, `` I would almost fight anybody'' who said <PERSON> Tipton </PERSON> looked too feminine to be a man. `` I came from a small town and was a mill worker. He had feminine features and at first, I thought he was kind of queer. But after I went to work for him I had no reason to think that,'' <PERSON> O'Neill </PERSON> said. `` He was a straight guy and there was no hanky-panky.'' <PERSON> Tipton </PERSON> `` was the type of person who would give you the shirt off his back. He made gobs of money for other people and ended up with nothing,'' he said. <PERSON> Tipton </PERSON> stayed for several months in a rooming house run by the Teagardens' mother in <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, Ms. <PERSON> Teagarden </PERSON> remembers. <PERSON> Tipton </PERSON> was in her late teens and lived with an older woman. Even then, <PERSON> Tipton </PERSON> dressed in men's clothing. `` <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> was trying to get started. She had a few jobs around town, but I never heard her play,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Teagarden </PERSON>. <PERSON> Tipton </PERSON> told members of her trio she had learned to play piano from <PERSON> Norma </PERSON> <PERSON> Teagarden </PERSON>, who also doubts that <PERSON> Tipton </PERSON> played with her famous brother <PERSON> Jack </PERSON>. `` A lot of people claim those kinds of things. If they did play with my brother's band, it was usually someone drafted for one night to replace one of the regulars who got sick,'' she said. `` There's something very sad about it, to have to live all your life like that, under false pretenses.

 A small-town lawyer ordered by federal courts to represent convicts says the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> should let him off the case because he would not be able to provide competent courtroom representation. `` I consider myself a business lawyer,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mallard </PERSON>, 34, whose case was scheduled to go before the high court Tuesday. `` I consider myself very competent to read the law, construe the law and argue the law, but not to take on some of these courtroom responsibilities,'' he said. <PERSON> Mallard </PERSON>, a partner in a law firm in this southeastern <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> town of 9,500 people, was picked to represent three inmates in June 1987 from a list of more than 100 attorneys compiled by the Volunteer Lawyers Project, a joint venture of the <ORGANIZATION> Legal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Iowa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. The inmates at the <ORGANIZATION> Iowa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Penitentiary </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Madison </LOCATION> filed a civil rights lawsuit alleging that guards and officials mistreated them, endangered their lives by revealing they were informants and filed false disciplinary reports against them. One inmate is out on parole. Courts routinely assign lawyers to represent indigent defendants in criminal cases and the lawyers are paid at taxpayer expense, which is generally a fraction of what they normally could receive. In civil rights lawsuits, lawyers are paid expenses and may be paid a part of any damages won by their clients. <PERSON> Mallard </PERSON>'s request to be taken off the case was denied by a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> magistrate, a federal district judge and the 8th <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION>. He contends those decisions misinterpreted an 1892 federal statute that says the court may request rather than order an attorney to represent an indigent defendant. The <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> attorney general's office, which will argue the case against <PERSON> Mallard </PERSON>, says he is shirking his obligations. `` When a judge asks you to help him or her out in the administration of justice, it's your duty and obligation to say ` Yes' and to do your best job,'' Deputy Attorney General <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> said earlier this month. `` But in Mr. <PERSON> Mallard </PERSON>'s case, he simply did n't say that. He said ` I do n't want to play, I do n't want to come to your party.' `` Mr. <PERSON> Mallard </PERSON> is not incompetent,'' <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> said. `` He's carrying this all the way to the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> and doing an admirable job. Incompetency by itself is not a reason for exclusion of your responsibility. `` Unfortunately for the inmates, their case has just done nothing, it's gone nowhere while we have litigated Mr. <PERSON> Mallard </PERSON>'s responsibility to represent them. The case is being closely watched by lawyers, said <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Londen </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>'s legal services section. `` We're very troubled by saddling a client with a lawyer who's unwilling to represent the client, said <PERSON> Londen </PERSON>, who filed a friend-of-the-court brief on <PERSON> Mallard </PERSON>'s behalf `` It's not fair to the client.'' But <ORGANIZATION> Iowa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Legal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. Deputy Director <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Ozga </PERSON>, who filed a brief to support the state attorney general, said the high court should compel <PERSON> Mallard </PERSON> to take the case `` If you're talking trial lawyers and that's all they do, you're talking about a fairly small amount of people,'' <PERSON> Ozga </PERSON> said `` You'd never be able to get enough attorneys to represent people.

<HEAD>Parks Chief Advises Against Feeding Starving Yellowstone Elk, Bison</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN KUGLIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK, Wyo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Elk and bison in fire ravaged <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION> would be better helped by long-term solutions rather than by donations of hay, says the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> director. A severe winter and loss of natural foods because of last summer's drought and huge fires have driven hundreds of elk and bison over the park boundary into southern <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>. In the small <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> town of <LOCATION> Gardiner </LOCATION>, north of the park, starving elk are eating ornamental hedges, trees, and hay donated by sympathetic people. Small herds of elk and buffalo have congregated in town. `` They are skinny and weak,'' said <PERSON> Trudi </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>, who helped raise money to feed the animals after one elk died in her yard. She said she hopes to save younger cows that will soon calve. `` In this town, most of the people make their money off these animals. At least they could give a little back,'' she said, referring to the area's popularity with hunters and tourists. But feeding hay to elk is expensive and can spread disease when elk gather at feeding stations, <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> Director <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Penn </PERSON> <PERSON> Mott </PERSON> told a news conference at park headquarters. Once rangers start providing hay to elk in <LOCATION> Yellowstone </LOCATION>, the expensive practice could continue indefinitely, like at the national elk refuge in <LOCATION> Jackson </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Mott </PERSON>, who was sent on a fact-finding trip Saturday by new <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Lujan </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr </PERSON>. Almost 500 of <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION>'s 2,700 bison have been shot in <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> in a state-sanctioned hunt, and 250 additional permits have been issued. More than 2,350 elk from <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION>'s northern herd of 19,000 were shot by <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> hunters this winter. Inside Yellowstone, rangers have counted more than 300 elk carcasses. <PERSON> Mott </PERSON> said one option he could support was to have the federal government acquire more winter game range in <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> north of the park. The <ORGANIZATION> Rocky </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mountain </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elk </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Missoula </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mont. </LOCATION>, announced Friday that it will start a special fund toward expanding winter range for <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION>'s northern elk herd. <PERSON> Mott </PERSON> also said he will ask the <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, other federal and state agencies and conservation groups to help draft a report to look at <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION>'s total wildlife management program, which he called fragmented. `` This is needed so that everybody knows what is going to be done for long-term management of <LOCATION> Yellowstone </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> and preservation of the area,'' he said. <PERSON> Mott </PERSON> said he hoped a wildlife report would be completed within six months. `` We will look at the total ecosystem and how to best manage wildlife. If land is being overgrazed, we should look at this.'' <PERSON> Mott </PERSON> repeated his support for reintroduction of wolves into <LOCATION> Yellowstone </LOCATION>, saying they could help keep big-game populations in balance and are part of the West's `` biological diversity.'' Elk and bison populations in <LOCATION> Yellowstone </LOCATION> are near all-time highs because of recent mild winters. The big-game herds are in no danger of extinction, but in some areas visitors may see fewer animals this year, he said. `` Even if winter kill -LRB- of northern herd elk -RRB- is 50 percent, there would still be a core that would rapidly reproduce,'' he said. <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Meagher </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION> biologist, said `` bison have the biological capacity of recovering from low numbers.'' She recalled that the park's hundreds of bison started with a remnant population of 22 animals. <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> officials authorized a bison hunt because about half of <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION>'s bison carry the disease brucellosis, which some scientists say could be transmitted to cattle. But <PERSON> Meagher </PERSON> said her best information from the <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> state veterinarian was that no cases of brucellosis in that state had been traced to Yellowstone Park animals. She pointed out that ranchers vaccinate their calves against the disease. Last year, only 39 bison were shot in <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>'s hunt, and this year's hunt has been denounced as a slaughter by activists such as <ORGANIZATION> Cleveland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Amory </ORGANIZATION>, president of the Fund for Animals.

 Inmates at three city jails may have been served unsanitary food, the city <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said after finding more than 100 health-code violations including signs of mice, roaches and flies, according to a report published today. Inspections last month found unsanitary conditions in a jail on <LOCATION> Rikers </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> and two facilities in <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> said, citing <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> reports. The three jails house more than 4,500 inmates. Of the violations, 24 were deemed hazardous. <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Adkins </PERSON> said the most serious involved serving food at the wrong temperature, which could lead to salmonella poisoning. The reports cited evidence of mice, flies and roaches in food-storage areas and in one case, what may have been human excrement, the News said. They also cited inoperative toilets and dishwashers, and possible asbestos-containing material. The Correction Department has been working with the <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> to remedy problems, said <PERSON> Julian </PERSON> <PERSON> Prager </PERSON>, an assistant correction commissioner, adding that conditions were not that bad. `` They could write up anybody's house worse than this,'' he said.

 Medicare reform and other health programs are suffering because the new <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration still has many vacancies in key government jobs, executives of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> charged. `` Almost four months after the elections, we are still wondering who will be named to the post of presidential science adviser,'' Dr. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sammons </PERSON> said Sunday in a speech closing the <ORGANIZATION> AMA </ORGANIZATION>'s 1989 National Leadership Conference. `` There's nobody in charge at the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Sammons </PERSON>, the association's executive vice president, added later. `` And we do n't have an assistant secretary of <ORGANIZATION> defense </ORGANIZATION> for health at the Pentagon.'' The lack of people in top health positions delays progress on health programs and puts the executive branch at a disadvantage in dealing with <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on upcoming legislation, said Dr. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Todd </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> AMA </ORGANIZATION>'s deputy vice president. `` We are terribly concerned about it,'' he said. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday is likely to confirm Dr. <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> for the <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> post at the health department, the largest federal agency. The 114,000-employee department administers a third of federal spending. <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>'s confirmation hearing before the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> was delayed for three weeks because an <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> background investigation was incomplete and there were questions about his finances. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> acknowledged last week that many positions remain unfilled in federal agencies. But he said he's not concerned about the vacancies because the employees remaining from the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration share <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s goals. <PERSON> Sammons </PERSON> said the delay on appointments is just one problem, and that the administration and <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> have shown `` neglect'' on health issues since the election. `` During the campaign for a kinder and gentler <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, President-elect <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and just about every congressman and senator you can name talked about taking care of the elderly and the needy,'' <PERSON> Sammons </PERSON> said. `` Today, while 37 million Americans have no health insurance at all, and another 17 million have only partial coverage, the only thing I hear coming out of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> is taking $ 5 billion more out of the Medicare budget.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> proposed a $ 5 billion cut to <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> when he announced his revisions of President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s 1990 budget proposal, which already called for reducing spending on the program. <PERSON> Sammons </PERSON> called on participants in the conference to influence government policy to help Americans with inadequate health insurance and to ensure long-term care for the elderly.

 Federal investigators focused on a jumbo jet's cargo door locks as the cause of an accident that killed nine passengers, and <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> inspected the baggage compartment hatches of all its <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 747s The <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION>, meanwhile, ended a sea and air search of the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> 100 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION> after recovering 57 pieces of debris from the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> flight. Flight 811 took off Friday for <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION> with 354 people and was about 100 miles from <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION> when the fuselage ripped open as the plane flew at 22,000 feet. Nine passengers were sucked out of the 18-year-old jetliner and are presumed dead. The pilot, Capt. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Cronin </PERSON>, lost power in one of the four engines and shut down another when a fire indicator light went on, but the plane returned safely to <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>. Among the items recovered were seat cushions, an overhead compartment, a section of fuselage, safety instruction cards and personal items including baby shoes and a teddy bear, authorities said. Neither human remains nor the cargo door was recovered Sunday, said <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Dickinson </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> investigator. `` Obviously, if we had the door it would be very helpful to us,'' he said Sunday night, but added that other information could pinpoint the cause. `` We are focusing on and looking at the latching mechanism,'' said <PERSON> Dickinson </PERSON>. `` We're also trying to get a better handle on these latch pin supports and comparing them to others.'' Investigators have determined that the right, forward cargo bay door had been closed electronically, with eight latching mechanisms along the bottom, attached to the plane's frame, as well as a latching mechanism and a hook pin on each side, said <PERSON> Dickinson </PERSON>. A warning system that would have alerted the cockpit if the door were not closed properly worked during a test Sunday, <PERSON> Dickinson </PERSON> said. He said he did not know if a warning light went off when the cargo door tore off the plane. <PERSON> Dickinson </PERSON> said there was no evidence that metal fatigue _ weakness caused gradually by long-term use _ or sabotage had caused the accident, and that <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> explosives experts had been sent home. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Transportation Secretary <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> agreed today that sabotage or a bomb was not a cause. `` It appears now from all the evidence that there was no explosion of any type,'' he said on <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Good Morning America.'' `` And so I think we can pretty well rule that out.'' But he cautioned that the investigators were still working. `` The preliminary indications, of course, are that the door opened or at least the skins peeled around the door. `` But let's wait till the board reports,'' he said. `` Then we'll know finally what went on Premature speculation is very dangerous.'' <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION>'s special checks of the latches, seals, fittings and other parts of the door mechanisms of its 30 other <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 747s were to be completed by early today, said airline spokesman <PERSON> Rob </PERSON> <PERSON> Doughty </PERSON>. `` Nobody told us we had to do this,'' he said. `` It's a precautionary decision based on the area that was impacted in this incident.'' Besides the new inspections, <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON> said mechanics licensed by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> would inspect each 747 cargo door upon arrival and would oversee the closing of each 747 cargo door before takeoff. The closings have been handled by ramp personnel, his statement said. <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON> said the 747 involved in the accident was in compliance with all <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> airworthiness directives and maintenance requirements pertaining to cargo doors and that the door worked properly before the accident. However, the cargo door locks had not yet been modified under a July order that was issued by the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> after a door in one 747 partly opened in flight. The deadline for that work is the end of this year. <PERSON> Doughty </PERSON> said he did not know whether <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> would now rush the modifications. United had inspected all 25 of its older 747s covered by the order but had completed the required reinforcements on just six by last week, said <PERSON> Doughty </PERSON>. Three of the 27 people injured remained hospitalized. Two were listed in fair condition, including the most seriously injured _ a 48-year-old flight attendant who suffered broken bones in her neck and upper back and abdominal injuries. Passenger <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Rij </PERSON>, 70, of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION>, remained under observation in stable condition because of a heart condition. <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Rij </PERSON> said his life was spared because a changed seating assignment moved him from the area of the plane where the seats were sucked out. `` That really saved my life,'' he said. `` I think I ended up with the safest seat on the whole plane.''

 Some 250 spectators cheered as a space shuttle main engine roared to life and sent smoke across the <ORGANIZATION> Marshall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Flight </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> during a successful 45-second test firing. `` Anything that goes the full duration looks and sounds like a good test to me,'' center director <PERSON> J.R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> said after Saturday's test at the northern <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> base. <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> said the benefits of the test firings should be seen by the mid-1990s when <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> plans to begin sending pieces of its space station into orbit aboard the space shuttle. <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> engineers fired the engine as part of a series of tests to make the main engines for the space shuttle more effective. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> McCarty </PERSON>, head of the propulsion laboratory at <LOCATION> Marshall </LOCATION>, said the tests will help reduce internal engine stress, making the shuttle's main engines last longer. `` We're validating changes in the engine _ the first real ones since it was designed in 1972,'' <PERSON> McCarty </PERSON> said. Saturday's 45-second test firing will be followed in three to four weeks by a longer 100-second firing.

 Soviet Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> said today his visit to <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> signals expanded ties with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, whose revolutionary leader says he wants <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> to help combat the `` devilish'' West. `` In our opinion, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> enjoys high international prestige,'' <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s official news agency quoted <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> as saying. `` We have come to the conclusion that it is a must to acknowledge others' beliefs and respect them. <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> made his remarks at a meeting with President <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Khamenei </PERSON>. On Sunday, he met with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s revolutionary leader, <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>, for 90 minutes. The <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> was quoted as saying his visit held the promise of closer ties between <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and the Soviets despite `` ideological differences.'' <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION> did not quote <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> as enumerating the differences, but <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> _ an <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> republic </ORGANIZATION> _ previously has criticized the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s official atheism. <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> was quoted as saying the two sides agreed that military confrontations must be reduced and chemical weapons annihilated worldwide, according to <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION>. He also said <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> would push for progress in the <LOCATION> Iran-Iraq </LOCATION> peace talks, stalled since the Aug. 20 cease-fire in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> war. <PERSON> Khamenei </PERSON> told <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>, `` <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> must be pressured, and we think your government can exert this pressure more than anyone else,'' <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION> said. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> was <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s major weapons supplier during the war and is believed to be one of its biggest creditors. <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> repeated his call for the withdrawal of foreign forces from the gulf, saying `` We have explicitly announced to the American president that we condemn the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military presence in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>, and will continue this policy until the Americans withdraw their troops from the region.'' The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has 23 warships in and around the gulf, the biggest fleet in the strategic waterway where the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> keeps seven to nine ships. The Soviet envoy has said <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> is willing to withdraw its ships. On Sunday, parliamentiary deputies moved to put severing ties with <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> to a floor vote on Tuesday. Last week, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> recalled its diplomats from <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> to protest <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>'s death decree for British author <PERSON> Salman </PERSON> <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION> said editorials in <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> newspapers today supported breaking ties. It said <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> did not ask <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> to withdraw his order for Moslem zealots to assassinate <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>, whose novel `` The Satanic Verses'' is considered blasphemous by many Moslems. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> reportedly had asked <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> to press <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> to reprieve <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>, but <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION> said, ` There was no mention of the -LRB- <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> -RRB- affair in <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>'s speech.'' <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>, the highest ranking Soviet official to visit <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> since the 1979 Islamic revolution, met <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> two days after the Iranian spiritual leader declared <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> does not need relations with the West. <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> has been widely condemned in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> for issuing the death decree. At their meeting, <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> stressed to <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> the importance of `` the expansion of strong ties in various dimensions in confronting the devilish acts of the West,'' <ORGANIZATION> Tehran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> reported. <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> Radio, monitored in <LOCATION> Nicosia </LOCATION>, broadcast a recording of excerpts from the dialogue and <ORGANIZATION> Tehran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> showed <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>, wearing a skullcap and robes with a blanket over his knees, talking to <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>. Afterward, <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> met Prime Minister <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> <PERSON> Musavi </PERSON> and delivered an invitation for him to visit <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, according to <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Tehran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> said the two agreed to set up mechanisms for `` regulating political contacts'' between <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>, who was born into a Moslem family in <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, has been in hiding since <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> issued his execution order Feb. 14.

 A bomb killed a Moslem civilian today in <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> during a demonstration over `` The Satanic Verses'', and police linked a fatal blast in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> to Moslem protests over the novel. The publisher, meanwhile, is considering labeling unsold copies of <PERSON> Salman </PERSON> <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>'s book with an apology in an effort to defuse the protests, a <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> newspaper reported today. Thousands of Shiite Moslems demonstrated in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> on Sunday in support of <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>'s order Feb. 14 that Moslems seek out and kill the British author and his publishers. The <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> India </ORGANIZATION> news agency reported that today's bombing in <LOCATION> Jammu-Kashmir </LOCATION> state was aimed at police who were trying to prevent demonstrators from closing shops in <LOCATION> Srinagar </LOCATION> However, a Moslem civilian was killed instead and seven people were injured, including a police officer and two news photographers, <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> said. The news agency said the demonstrators were trying to enforce a general strike to protest Friday's police gunfire during rioting over the novel in <LOCATION> Bombay </LOCATION>. Nine people were shot and killed. At least 18 people have been killed since Feb. 12 in <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> in violence related to `` The Satanic Verses.'' On Sunday, a bomb blast killed a guard outside a British cultural center in <LOCATION> Karachi </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, police said. Police identified the victim as <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Shafi </PERSON>, 65, and said the explosion destroyed the building's guard room. Asked whether the blast was connected to the furor over <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>'s novel, one officer said, `` It appears that way. He spoke on condition of anonymity. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, a senior <ORGANIZATION> Viking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Penguin </ORGANIZATION> editor attending an emergency meeting of the Writers' Guild of <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> said hardback copies of the novel were selling so well that a paperback edition, due out in August, might be delayed for `` crude commercial'' reasons. But the editor denied reports that <PERSON> Viking </PERSON> <PERSON> Penguin </PERSON> was considering canceling the paperback edition to appease Moslems who consider the book blasphemous. `` We are continuing to make the book available,'' he was quoted as telling The Guardian, a <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> newspaper. `` It's simply not possible to keep up with demand.'' `` If there is a way to keep the book in print and prevent further loss of life, and if the way to do that is print some form of apology, then maybe we should do that,'' he was quoted as saying. He asked not to be identified because of the death threats. <PERSON> Viking </PERSON> <PERSON> Penguin </PERSON> refused to comment today on its plans for the book. Thousands of American Moslems protested the novel over the weekend in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. About 5,000 pro-Iranian Shiite Moslems burned effigies of <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> during a march in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, on Sunday. <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> television reported thousands of Moslems also demonstrated in the holy city of <LOCATION> Qom </LOCATION>, chanting `` We are at your service <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>'' and `` Death to <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>!'' <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>, 41, was born to a Moslem family in <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>. He has been in hiding since <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> ordered Moslems to kill him and Iranian clerics put a bounty on his head of up to $ 5.2 million. <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> has apologized for any distress his novel caused, but <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> rejected the overture. The 12 <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> countries as well as <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> have recalled their ambassadors from <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> in protest, and <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> has retaliated by withdrawing its top envoys from those countries. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s parliament is to vote Tuesday on whether to sever relations with <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> because of the furor over `` The Satanic Verses.'' The nation's official <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> reported today that newspapers believed such a move would be a `` practical step'' and would reflect <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>'s position that relations with the West are unnecessary. Moslems say the book insults Islam by portraying the wives of the prophet <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> as prostitutes and suggesting he wrote the Koran, the Moslem holy book, rather than receiving it from Allah. The book has been banned in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Brunei </LOCATION>.

 Fire touched off by a train derailment spread to another railroad tanker car early today, forcing thousands of people to keep out of their homes and schools, authorities said. Only one of the four cars of highly flammable butane that caught fire Sunday night was burning shortly before dawn, but then fire started at another car, said Lt. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Summerlot </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Akron </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. Firefighters stood by, waiting for the fire to go out. The burning cars were among 17 that derailed from a <ORGANIZATION> CSX </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> train on the grounds of the <ORGANIZATION> B.F. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Goodrich </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Plant </ORGANIZATION>, Fire Chief <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Romanoski </PERSON> said. `` I was watching TV and I heard something and saw the whole sky light up,'' said <PERSON> Minnie </PERSON> <PERSON> Herrington </PERSON>, 40, who was brought to a shelter with her four children, ages 4 to 11. `` It sounded like a gunshot.'' Thirteen people were treated at <LOCATION> Akron </LOCATION> <LOCATION> General </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>, most suffering from inhalation of smoke and fumes. One man was admitted, in fair condition. About 1,500 homes within a half mile of Sunday evening's accident were evacuated, police said. They estimated the number of evacuees at 2,000. Shelters were set up at <ORGANIZATION> Kenmore </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Akron </ORGANIZATION> for those who could not stay with friends or relatives. Schools in this city of 250,000 were closed and metropolitan bus service was canceled today because the city bus garage is near the derailment site, <PERSON> Summerlot </PERSON> said. Businesses in the area also were closed today, he said. The 45-car train was en route from <PERSON> Willard </PERSON> to <LOCATION> Akron </LOCATION> and back to <PERSON> Willard </PERSON> when the derailment occurred, <ORGANIZATION> CSX </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> said. The cause was under investigation. Nine cars carried highly flammable butane, <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> said. The eight other cars that derailed carried non-hazardous materials such as vegetable oil, clay and sand, he said. Another car on the train contained butadiene, which may produce hazardous smoke when burned, but it was too far from the burning cars, Mayor <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Plusquellic </PERSON> said. There was some concern, however, that the fire could spread to the Goodrich plant, which also housed butadiene, he said. Butane is non-toxic when burned and is used as a fuel and an aerosol propellant. Butadiene is a petroleum derivative used to make synthetic rubbers and resins. `` The area was evacuated because of the danger of explosion in the surrounding tank cars,'' said <PERSON> Romanoski </PERSON>. He said evacuees would not be allowed to return to home until the fire was extinguished. More than 80 people were evacuated to the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Akron </ORGANIZATION>, which would be closed at least until noon, said spokesman <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Zimmer </PERSON>. About 550 people were taken to <LOCATION> Kenmore </LOCATION>, but many had left the school to stay with relatives or friends. About 300 people remained at midnight. The mood of the evacuees ran from `` resignation to almost ... festive,'' said <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, assistant school superintendent. Children were given access to the cafeteria and the gymnasium, where several were playing basketball. `` The kids are all in a good mood,'' <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said. `` We've had people bring their rabbits, guinea pigs and dogs. I've been in this business 25 years. A woman comes up to me with a dirty diaper and says ` Where do I put this?' I've never been asked that before.''

 Former <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Rudolph </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON> has pledged a `` clean sweep'' of appointed officials in city government, referring to his as-yet-unannounced mayoral campaign as if it were under way. Appearing Sunday on <ORGANIZATION> WNBC-TV </ORGANIZATION>'s `` News Forum,'' <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON> took Mayor <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> and the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> to task for allowing inefficiency and corruption to fester. When appointments are dictated by political party bosses, `` You're just going right down the primrose path to inefficient government, ineffective government, and then sometimes just corrupt government,'' <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON>, a Republican, gave some of his strongest indications to date that he would enter the mayoral race. `` I'm going to make it very clear from the very beginning that anyone that donates money to my campaign should do it because they want reform, nonpartisan government in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>,'' he said. The only announced <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> candidate, cosmetics heir <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Lauder </PERSON>, already has spent around $ 750,000 in his quest for the nomination, according to the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>. City primary elections will be held in September, and the general election is set for November. <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON> stepped down last month after 5 -LCB- years as <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>, where he gained fame with prominent prosecutions of corrupt political figures, Wall Street executives, mobsters and others. He has said he is exploring a mayoral candidacy and has authorized fund-raising in his behalf, but has not declared his intention to run. Key issues are crime, drugs, education, housing, homelessness and jobs, <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON> said. He urged a city law to confiscate property from drug dealers, favored a bill curtailing the warehousing of vacant apartments and was noncommittal on commercial rent control. `` The city is in very, very bad shape, and the mayor is responsible for it,'' <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
 Thousands of mourners went to the hillside tomb of Emperor <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> to pray today, the first day the imperial cemetery was opened to the public since his burial. Under blue skies and against a backdrop of pine and cedar trees, about 7,000 people visited the cemetery, bowing their heads and clapping twice before <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>'s tomb in the traditional gestures of worship at shrines of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s Shinto religion. <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> died of cancer on Jan. 7 at age 87. Posthumously known as Emperor <PERSON> Showa </PERSON>, he was commemorated Friday in a state funeral in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> attended by representatives of 164 countries, including President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. Later the same day, he was entombed in the <ORGANIZATION> Musashi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Imperial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cemetery </ORGANIZATION>, a wooded enclave in these foothills about 30 miles west of <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>. Only palace officials and members of the imperial family took part in the entombment ceremony, deeply steeped in ancient Shinto rites and carried out to the strains of classical court music from wind instruments and gongs. Today, about 40 mourners, including 15 members of a group described by guards as rightists loyal to the emperor, were the first to enter the site of <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>'s tomb with their heads bowed and coats removed. One young rightist wore a headband with a red rising sun in the style of World War II kamikaze pilots who flew suicide missions in the name of the emperor. Another mourner, 63-year-old <PERSON> Masae </PERSON> <PERSON> Yamamoto </PERSON>, said he came from <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> with mixed feelings. `` I spent the last two years of the -LRB- past -RRB- war at the front and ... I have some reservations about the emperor's responsibility for the war.'' He added, however, `` After the difficult years of rebuilding the country, I also feel I share a common experience with the emperor and find myself feeling nostalgic after his passing.'' The cemetery will close again at the end of March to allow completion of the emperor's mausoleum. It will be covered in stone and landscaped over the next year. Many visitors took photographs of the tomb and surrounding hills. They then strolled over to the mausoleums of <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>'s parents, <ORGANIZATION> Emperor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Taisho </ORGANIZATION> and Empress <PERSON> Teimei </PERSON>, to pay their respects there as well.

 <LOCATION> EL-BIREH </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Occupied </LOCATION> <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- _ A <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> stabbed an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> border police soldier in the shoulder today and then was shot and captured after a chase, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> reports and the military said. The attack in <LOCATION> El-Bireh </LOCATION> followed two killings of <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers and the disappearance of another. The violence comes despite <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> pledges to refrain from deadly attacks and could undermine tentative efforts to arrange a peace dialogue. Also today, in the occupied <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, troops shot and wounded at least eight Palestinians in clashes in the refugee camps of Shati and Jabaliya. In the attack in <LOCATION> El-Bireh </LOCATION>, the border police soldier was stabbed twice in the shoulder, shouted `` I'm wounded,'' and then pursued his assailant with other soldiers, the army commander for <LOCATION> El-Bireh </LOCATION> said. The commander, identified only as Colonel Chai, said the border police soldier was part of a patrol walking on the edge of the market in <LOCATION> El-Bireh </LOCATION>, about 10 miles north of <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>. The assailant, identified as a teen-ager from <LOCATION> Ramallah </LOCATION>, was shot in the head and back, <PERSON> Chai </PERSON> said. He said troops were searching for the knife. The condition of the assailant was not immediately known. After the attack, the army ordered stores in the market area closed to prevent further violence, said an army spokesman, who is not identified under military regulations. Soldiers rounded up about 200 Palestinians, said an Arab reporter, who also spoke on condition of anonymity. One suspect was beaten by soldiers and hospitalized, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> reports and hospital officials said. The wounded soldier, a member of the Druse Arab minority, was in stable condition, <ORGANIZATION> Hadassah </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> reported. On Friday, a 24-year-old reserve paratrooper died in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> city of <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION> when a concrete block was dropped on his head. <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION> has been under curfew since then, and the search continues for the killer. An unarmed, out-of-uniform soldier was stabbed to death Feb. 18 in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Old </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. Two days earlier, another soldier was reported missing just north of the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. An anonymous caller today told the news agency <ORGANIZATION> Agence-France </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Presse </ORGANIZATION> that the <ORGANIZATION> Palestinian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> kidnapped the soldier Feb. 16 and was holding him captive. The army said it did not know if the claim was legitimate. Seventeen Israelis, including six soldiers, have been killed during the Palestinian uprising. At least 386 Palestinians have been killed since the revolt began Dec. 8, 1987, most shot by soldiers during violent protests by Palestinians. The uprising is aimed at ending <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> occupation in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> seized the areas in the 1967 <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> war.

 <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Goetz </PERSON>, who in 1984 shot four young men he said were going to rob him on a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> subway, today lost a <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> challenge to his conviction for illegally possessing a gun. The court, without comment, rejected arguments that <PERSON> Goetz </PERSON> was denied a fair trial. <PERSON> Goetz </PERSON>, who was sentenced to a year in jail and fined $ 5,000, began serving his term at the <LOCATION> Rikers </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> prison in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> last month. He is eligible for, but not assured of, parole after 51 days. His case won worldwide attention, prompting debates on self-defense and racism. Some called <PERSON> Goetz </PERSON>, a 41-year-old electronics engineer, a hero. Others called him a cold-hearted vigilante and racist. <PERSON> Goetz </PERSON> is white. The four teen-agers he shot are black. The subway shooting occurred Dec. 22, 1984 after one of the youths approached <PERSON> Goetz </PERSON> and asked him for $ 5. <PERSON> Goetz </PERSON> later said he feared he was going to be mugged and robbed. <PERSON> Goetz </PERSON> fled from the subway car and left <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. Nine days later he surrendered to police in <LOCATION> Concord </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.H. </LOCATION>. After a 1987 trial, <PERSON> Goetz </PERSON> was acquitted of attempted murder, assault and other charges He was convicted only on the gun-possession charge. In the appeal acted on today, lawyers for <PERSON> Goetz </PERSON> argued that he was denied a fair trial by the judge's instructions to jurors. The appeal said the judge violated <PERSON> Goetz </PERSON>'s rights by telling jurors they `` must'' _ rather than `` may'' _ convict him if they found that all elements of the illegal possession charge had been proved beyond a reasonable doubt. The jurors also were told they `` must'' acquit <PERSON> Goetz </PERSON> if they found that the proof was insufficient to sustain any element of the illegal possession charge. After his trial, jurors told reporters that <PERSON> Goetz </PERSON> was justified in shooting the men he thought were going to attack him. But they said they had no choice but to find him guilty of illegally possessing a gun. Lawyers for <PERSON> Goetz </PERSON> told the justices, `` The jury, by such compulsive language, was even potentially precluded from considering all factors, beyond the mere statutory elements, toward its determination of -LRB- <PERSON> Goetz </PERSON>'s -RRB- ultimate guilt.'' The appeal noted that <PERSON> Goetz </PERSON> had been mugged several times previously, and that he had unsuccessfully sought a permit to carry a gun. Prosecutors urged the justices to reject the appeal. `` There is not now _ and never has been _ the slightest conflict of opinion among federal and state appeals courts about the constitutionality of the kind of instruction delivered to -LRB- <PERSON> Goetz </PERSON>'s -RRB- jury,'' they said. <PERSON> Goetz </PERSON>'s initial sentence was overturned by a state appeals court, and he was resentenced last Jan. 13. The case is <PERSON> Goetz </PERSON> vs. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, 88-1122.

<HEAD>Court Refuses to Let Georgia City Collect Flood Control Legal Costs</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> today refused to let <LOCATION> Brunswick </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ga. </LOCATION>, collect a $ 324,000 reimbursement it won, and then lost, from the federal government for legal costs incurred in a fight over flood control. The justices, without comment, let stand a federal appeals court ruling that the coastal city does not qualify for the reimbursement. The dispute dates back to <ORGANIZATION> Brunswick </ORGANIZATION>'s request in the early 1980s to participate in the federally subsidized National Flood Insurance Program for communities that carefully control development of land likely to be flooded. In 1985, <ORGANIZATION> Brunswick </ORGANIZATION> sued the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Emergency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, which runs the program, and others over alleged errors in calculating <ORGANIZATION> Brunswick </ORGANIZATION>'s eligibility. The lawsuit ended in a settlement prior to any trial, and a federal trial judge ordered the government to pay <ORGANIZATION> Brunswick </ORGANIZATION> $ 324,000 for lawyer fees and other costs the city had incurred. The award was made under the Equal Access to Justice Act. Under that law, a local government that engages the federal government in legal battle is eligible for reimbursement if its net worth is less than $ 7 million and the federal government's position in the dispute was not `` substantially justified.'' The 11th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> last July 11 threw out the $ 324,000 award on two grounds. It said <ORGANIZATION> Brunswick </ORGANIZATION>'s net worth exceeds $ 7 million and the federal government's position in the flood control dispute was substantially justified. On the net-worth issue, <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> lawyers relied on the city's annual financial report showing `` total municipal equity'' to be just over $ 22 million when the lawsuit was filed. They said that figure reflected the city's net worth. But city lawyers said the `` net worth'' term used in the Equal Access to Justice Act should not include those assets generally not available to pay off debts. The city's water and sewer system wrongly was counted as an asset because its worth is not available for debt payment, the city's lawyers argued The 11th Circuit court said net worth is determined by subtracting `` total liabilities'' from `` total assets'' _ including the city's water and sewer system. The appeals court also ruled that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Alaimo </PERSON> abused his discretion in deciding that the federal government's legal position in the underlying dispute had not been substantially justified. The case is <ORGANIZATION> Brunswick </ORGANIZATION> vs. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION>, 88-948.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> today rejected `` reverse discrimination'' arguments by a white <LOCATION> Vallejo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, firefighter denied a promotion that went to a black man with a slightly lower test score. The court, without comment, let stand a ruling that upheld the black man's promotion to help achieve better racial balance within the city fire department. The 9th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> ruled that the promotion was lawful. <LOCATION> Vallejo </LOCATION>'s `` plan concerning the promotion of qualified minority employees is a minimally intrusive means to achieve racial balance and is thus a narrowly tailored remedy'' for past discrimination, the appeals court said. `` The city's plan provides for consideration of race only insofar as the merit principle can be preserved, making it a moderate and gradual remedy,'' the 9th Circuit court added. The city in 1983 denied a promotion to the job of firefighter-engineer to <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>, who is white. The job instead went to <PERSON> Errol </PERSON> <PERSON> Cooley </PERSON>, who is black. <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> achieved the top score, 94.17, on a competitive examination for the job. <PERSON> Cooley </PERSON>'s score was 93.09. Both men were beginning-level firefighters in <LOCATION> Vallejo </LOCATION>. City officials stressed the need for better racial balance in the department. <LOCATION> Vallejo </LOCATION> has a minority population of 40 percent, including 18.75 percent black. Only three of the city's 80 firefighters, 3.8 percent, were black when <PERSON> Cooley </PERSON> was promoted. The 9th Circuit court, in upholding the promotion, relied heavily on a 1987 <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruling that upheld the promotion of a woman who scored slightly lower than a male candidate for a county transportation job in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. The appeals court said <PERSON> Cooley </PERSON>'s promotion `` satisfies even the most rigorous equal protection requirements'' of the Constitution. The case is <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> vs. <LOCATION> Vallejo </LOCATION>, 87-1283.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>'s foreign minister today praised <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> for surrendering a disputed border enclave to <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>, saying he hopes the action can help advance efforts in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Esmat </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdel-Meguid </PERSON> spoke to reporters 12 hours after Egyptian, Israeli and <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> officials signed accords to end by mid-March <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s 22-year occupation of <LOCATION> Taba </LOCATION>, a 250-acre beach resort on the northern tip of the <LOCATION> Red </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION>. `` <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>'s resumption of sovereignty over <LOCATION> Taba </LOCATION> is a victory for peace and supports the possibilities of the peace process,'' <PERSON> Abdel-Meguid </PERSON> said. `` It is proof that if serious determination and good will are available, disputes can be resolved by peaceful ways.'' One agreement signed at <LOCATION> Taba </LOCATION>'s Sonesta hotel stipulates that the Egyptians pay the hotel's Israeli owner $ 37 million. Another set a price of $ 1.15 million for a nearby holiday village of beach cabanas and a cafeteria. The agreements give all tourists, including Israelis, 14 days' access without visas from <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Taba </LOCATION> and southern Sinai They also put the border between <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> back to its position prior to the 1967 <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> war, when the Jewish state occupied the <LOCATION> Sinai </LOCATION> peninsula. <LOCATION> Taba </LOCATION> became an irritant in <LOCATION> Egyptian-Israeli </LOCATION> relations in 1982 when <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> withdrew from the Sinai under the U.S.-brokered Camp David agreement, but refused to give up the tiny patch of beach. After years of fruitless negotiation, the two former <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> foes decided in 1986 to let international arbitrators decide <LOCATION> Taba </LOCATION>'s fate On Sept. 29, the arbitration committee ruled that <LOCATION> Taba </LOCATION> be returned to <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> but left open the fate of the beachfront. Except for the tourist facilities, the enclave includes virtually nothing but barren rock and sand hills. After obtaining easy access for its tourists, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> finally signed Sunday's series of agreements that will put <LOCATION> Taba </LOCATION> back in Egyptian hands by noon March 15. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> signed the agreement because it helped negotiate the pact. `` <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> hopes that completion of the <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> withdrawal becomes the start of a new stage during which we can expand the peace process in the area,'' <PERSON> Abdel-Meguid </PERSON> said. At the 40-minute signing ceremony, <LOCATION> Egyptian </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> delegates expressed similar hopes that future disputes between <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and its Arab neighbors be solved through negotiations. Egyptian Tourism Minister <PERSON> Fuad </PERSON> <PERSON> Sultan </PERSON>, who signed parts of the agreement package for <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>, said his government plans further tourist development of <LOCATION> Taba </LOCATION>'s bay, bordered by sandy beachs dotted by palm trees. In the past, most occupants of the hotel, built in the early 1980s, have been Israelis, but Egyptian officials have said they plan campaigns to lure Egyptian tourists as well. Because of the sensitivity of what it considered Egyptian land under foreign occupation, the government made <LOCATION> Taba </LOCATION> off-limits to Egyptians during much of the seven-year squabble over the area.

 <PERSON> Fang </PERSON> <PERSON> Lizhi </PERSON>, the dissident Chinese police prevented from attending a banquet given by President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, said today the president's statement of regret was `` a beginning'' but he hoped for more. White House press secretary <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> learned today that <PERSON> Fang </PERSON> and his wife were barred the banquet Sunday night, and that he `` expressed regret'' to Vice Premier <PERSON> Wu </PERSON> <PERSON> Xueqian </PERSON> before flying to <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said it is the president's view that such problems as human rights should be dealt with in a low-key and private manner. The 53-year-old <PERSON> Fang </PERSON>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s most famous dissident, is also an internationally respected astrophysicist. He maintains that Marxism is a failure in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and that a multiparty system is needed to guarantee basic human rights. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> said Ambassador <PERSON> Winston </PERSON> <PERSON> Lord </PERSON> met today with <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> officials to discuss the incident. Details of the meeting were not immediately available. <PERSON> Fang </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Shuxian </PERSON>, were traveling with an American couple to the banquet when police stopped their car a few blocks from the hotel where the banquet was held and accused the driver of speeding. Police prevented them from walking to the hotel, then halted a taxi to which they had transferred and ordered a bus not to pick them up. They insisted <PERSON> Fang </PERSON> and <PERSON> Li </PERSON> were not on the guest list, although the official <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> list bore their names. Police then tailed the four for 90 minutes as they walked to Lord's residence to seek help. <PERSON> Fang </PERSON> told about two dozen reporters jammed into his tiny apartment today that he was `` a little bit afraid'' Sunday night because of the many police. But he added, `` I ca n't change my views because of fear. We need freedom and human rights.'' `` I was very angry,'' said his wife. `` I'm not particularly afraid. It was crazy, stupid.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> did not raise human rights issues during his two days of meetings with Chinese leaders. However, senior leader <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaoping </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> General Secretary <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> <PERSON> Ziyang </PERSON> both stressed that domestic stability is more important now than democratic reform. <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> warned in unusually strong language that any <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> support for <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s dissidents would harm the bilateral relationship. <PERSON> Fang </PERSON> was careful not to criticize <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, saying, `` It's too early for me to evaluate him.'' But he said, `` I hope they -LRB- the Americans -RRB- say something more in the next few days. `` Regarding the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, I have a principled criticism: I want it to adopt a single standard toward human rights and not a double standard,'' he said. `` I think there are indeed some double standards'' in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>' open criticism of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s human rights record but not <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s. But he added, `` Of course, we Chinese must win our own human rights for ourselves.'' <PERSON> Fang </PERSON>, who is popular among Chinese students, said he did not want the police action against him to trigger student demonstrations. But he said he also does not expect the police action to silence government critics. `` I have received many phone calls from friends. They assured me they support me and they were very angry with the government,'' <PERSON> Fang </PERSON> said. `` One friend said a couple of days ago that we should be quiet, not speak so much. Today he called and said we should speak more.'' Several other government critics attended the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> banquet without interference. But none is as well-known outside <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> as <PERSON> Fang </PERSON>, who stepped into the political limelight in 1986 with eloquent speeches to college students calling for democracy and human rights. Authorities blamed him for a nationwide wave of student demonstrations in the winter of 1986-87 and expelled him from the ruling <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. Recently, they refused him permission to go to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to attend a scientific conference and teach. <PERSON> Fang </PERSON> recently sent an open letter to senior leader <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> calling for an amnesty for political prisoners, and the call was taken up by several dozen other leading writers and thinkers who sent a second letter.

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 With the mayoral primary in its final day, a poll showed Mayor <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON> narrowing the gap against <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Daley </PERSON>, who hopes to win the job his father held for two decades. The poll, taken Wednesday through Friday for <ORGANIZATION> WBBM-TV </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southtown </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economist </ORGANIZATION>, showed <PERSON> Daley </PERSON>'s lead over <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON> had narrowed to 7 percentage points, 47-40 percent. A substantial 11 percent of the 885 registered voters polled were undecided, and the poll's margin of error was 4 points. Two weeks earlier, the same poll showed <PERSON> Daley </PERSON> held a 10 point lead _ 43 to 33 percent. `` The mayor is poised in a very good position now to overtake <PERSON> Daley </PERSON>,'' said <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON>'s campaign spokesman <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Horist </PERSON>. `` This race is virtually tied up.'' <PERSON> Daley </PERSON> had no immediate comment about the poll. Whether it's too late for <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON> to avoid becoming the first black mayor of a major city to be defeated by a white remains the question. With the Democratic primary set for Tuesday, both candidates campaigned vigorously during the weekend, each invoking the name of the late Mayor <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Washington </PERSON>, the city's first black mayor, and citing the need to heal the city's racial divisions. `` <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Washington </PERSON> was a strong mayor who loved the city,'' <PERSON> Daley </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Cook </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> state's attorney, told an all-black congregation, one of three he visited Sunday. `` My father was a strong mayor who loved the city,'' added <PERSON> Daley </PERSON>, the son of the late <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Daley </PERSON>, who was <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>'s mayor for 21 years. <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON> campaigned at 10 black churches. At the <ORGANIZATION> Antioch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Baptist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>, the mayor received a standing ovation for his solo rendition of the hymn `` How Great Thou Art.'' <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> campaigned with <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON>, leading supporters in chants of `` maintain the gains,'' saying he wants to keep the multi-racial city government that <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON> has helped build. <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON> has gained steadily in polls during recent months, while <PERSON> Daley </PERSON>, despite his lead, remains below 50 percent. The latest Southtown Economist-WBBM poll indicated that the electorate remained divided along racial lines. <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON> received the support of 73 percent of registered black voters surveyed to <PERSON> Daley </PERSON>'s 8 percent. Whites split 79-14 percent for <PERSON> Daley </PERSON>. Hispanics favored <PERSON> Daley </PERSON> by 2-1. The poll also found that 80 percent of blacks questioned said they definitely will vote Tuesday, versus 73 percent of whites. <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>'s population is about 40 percent black, 40 percent white and nearly 20 percent Hispanic. Whoever wins the primary faces the Republican challenger and the third-party candidacy of black alderman <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> in April 4's general election However the Democratic race turns out, the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> candidate in April will be white _ and could be former <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> power <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Vrdolyak </PERSON>, who has launched an 11th-hour Republican primary write-in campaign. <PERSON> Vrdolyak </PERSON>, who joined the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> ranks after losing to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> in 1987, is challenging the officially endorsed <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> candidate, Dr. <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Sohn </PERSON>, a physician and lawyer. If <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON> wins the Democratic primary, the black vote could split between <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON> and <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> in the general election, bringing a white back into the mayor's office. If <PERSON> Daley </PERSON> and <PERSON> Vrdolyak </PERSON> win, <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> would gain from the split in the white vote. The winner will fill out the remaining two years in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s term The era of big-city black mayors in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> began in 1967, when <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Stokes </PERSON> was elected in <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION> now has a white mayor, but that happened after <PERSON> Stokes </PERSON> decided not to seek re-election. Amongthe nation's very largest cities, no black incumbent has ever lost to a white. But in <LOCATION> Charlotte </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, the nation's 44th largest city, incumbent Mayor <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> <PERSON> Gantt </PERSON>, a black, lost to a white challeger in 1987.

<TEXT>
 A civil rights lawyer who says the government violated his rights by eavesdropping on his conversations with clients lost a <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> appeal today. The court, without comment, refused to revive <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Kinoy </PERSON>'s lawsuit for monetary damages <PERSON> Kinoy </PERSON>'s suit stems from <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> wiretapping from 1949 through 1970 of various people he represented. His clients have included <PERSON> Julius </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ethel </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosenberg </PERSON>, executed for giving atomic bomb secrets to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, and members of the so-called <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> Seven, who were accused of conspiring to incite a riot at the Democratic National Convention in 1968. Government officials said the wiretaps, installed without court warrants, were designed to protect national security. The government said the eavesdropping was not aimed at <PERSON> Kinoy </PERSON>, who teaches law at <ORGANIZATION> Rutgers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Brunswick </LOCATION>, <PERSON> N.J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kinoy </PERSON>'s suit was filed in 1970, and eight years of pre-trial maneuvering ensued. The case was dormant from 1979 until 1985 when <PERSON> Kinoy </PERSON> sought to revive it, claiming the government violated the confidentiality of the lawyer-client relationship. The 2nd U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> last July threw out the suit. `` <PERSON> Kinoy </PERSON>, as an attorney, possessed no constitutional right, independent of his clients' rights, to communicate with his clients without government intrusion when national security interests were at stake,'' the appeals court said. The appeals court noted that <PERSON> Kinoy </PERSON> previously won a court order barring the government from any future surveillance that would violate his privacy rights. But the 2nd Circuit court said there is no ground for <PERSON> Kinoy </PERSON> to collect damages from the government or from <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> officials who authorized or conducted the eavesdropping. The case is <PERSON> Kinoy </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Tolson </PERSON>, 88-892.

<HEAD>Court Lets Stand Bank Robbery Ruling in California Case</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> today let stand a ruling that someone who plans a bank robbery but is arrested before actually moving toward the bank may not be convicted of violating a federal law prohibiting attempted bank robbery. The court, over two dissenting votes, rejected a <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> appeal that sought reinstatement of an attempted bank robbery conviction in a <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> case. Justices <PERSON> Byron </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON> and <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Blackmun </PERSON> voted to hear arguments in the case but four votes are needed to grant such review. The case stems from the arrest of <PERSON> Reginald </PERSON> <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> Still on Aug. 7, 1985, in <LOCATION> Roseville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif </LOCATION>. Responding to a tip from a passerby, police found Still sitting in a van parked some 200 feet from the <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>. The van's motor was running when police arrived and Still put it in reverse and drove off. Police caught up with him and arrested him. Police said he told them, `` You did a good job. You caught me five minutes before I was going to rob a bank.'' He said he confessed because of incriminating evidence inside the van _ including a blond wig, a phony bomb and a note demanding money that Still said he intended to present to a teller at a drive-up window. Police said Still told them his confession was merely `` frosting on the cake'' because of the other evidence. He was convicted in federal court of attempted bank robbery and interstate transporation of a stolen vehicle _ the van he said he intended to use in the robbery. Still was sentenced to 15 years in prison. The 9th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> upheld the stolen van conviction but threw out the conviction for attempted bank robbery. `` Still's intent to rob the <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> was clearly established,'' the appeals court said. But the `` facts do not establish either actual movement toward the bank or actions that are analytically similar to such movement,'' the appeals court said. Without that, there can be no conviction for attempted bank robbery, it added. <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> lawyers said the appeals court ruling establishes a dangerous precedent. `` Attempts are punished as a crime because of the great need to stop offenses from occurring,'' department lawyers said. `` A robbery may be only moments away even though the robber has not yet begun to assault the bank,'' they continued. `` Society should be free to intervene in order not only to stop a crime from coming to pass, but also to punish the defendant for putting innocent parties at risk of the loss of their property, serious injury or death.'' The government's appeal said the 9th Circuit court ruling, which is binding law in <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state, is in conflict with other federal courts. <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> statistics show that in 1987 nearly half of all robberies of federally insured financial institutions occurred in states within the 9th Circuit, the government said. The case is <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> vs. Still, 88-581.

<HEAD>Dukakis Says Kemp's Talk Doesn't Match Bush's Budget</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Top 10 grafs new; pickup at pvs 4th graf, Bush's budget</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM M. WELCH</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
 Former Democratic presidential nominee <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> told new Housing and Urban Development Secretary <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> today there is a `` yawning gap'' between his optimistic talk about solving urban problems and President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s federal budget proposal. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, the governor of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, injected a reminder of the 1988 presidential campaign with his remarks to <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> during the annual winter meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Governors </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> secretary, who himself sought the Republican presidential nomination last year, described his hopes for using tax incentives and private enterprise to reinvigorate cities to a committee of the association. When <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> took questions from the governors, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said `` I applaud'' <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>'s efforts and noted many of his proposals have already been put to work by states and cities. But <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> then asked him to reconcile his enthusiastic talk about solving problems of poverty, homelessness and housing with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s budget, which would provide no new spending for subsidized housing and would cut some federal money to states and cities. `` On the other hand, as I look over the president's budget, there is a yawning gap between what you're saying and what's in there,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. He pointed to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s proposal to further cut back the <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Block </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Grant </ORGANIZATION> program, which <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said governments use as public capital to attract additional private investment in housing and other development projects. `` The budget does need some reworking,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> responded, `` I think the president, despite criticism to the contrary, has evidenced a good faith effort to work with the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>.'' He said `` it's obligatory upon the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>'' to work in cooperation with the president on the budget. <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> cited the restraints on the federal budget but pledged, `` I can assure you that I am going to do everything I can to make sure that there is adequate funding for those programs that work.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s budget director, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Darman </PERSON>, declined an invitation to meet with the governors. But they heard a frank assessment Sunday from the chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, Sen. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Sasser </PERSON>, who warned, `` We're fresh out of cash here in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>.'' An <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> survey of governors before their arrival found that most state executives respect <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s `` no new taxes'' pledge and are holding off on calls for raising revenue to reduce the federal deficit. Governors in both parties said that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s promise of a `` kinder, gentler <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'' suggested his administration will be more receptive to state needs than was President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, whose administration dramatically reduced federal aid flowing to states. `` I think he's already shown himself more receptive to domestic problems,'' said Republican Gov. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Kean </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, who cited housing as the top domestic need. <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>'s Democratic Gov. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Blanchard </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> `` has the potential of being, from <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>'s point of view, a better president than <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. Not necessarily more popular, but more compassionate.'' At the same time, however, governors voiced concern that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s proposed federal budget for fiscal 1990 will bring another round of domestic spending cuts that will require increased spending by the states `` We wo n't become a ` kinder and gentler' nation until we address our domestic needs, such as children at risk, the homeless and the mentally ill,'' said <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state's Democratic Gov. <PERSON> Booth </PERSON> <PERSON> Gardner </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s 1988 Democratic opponent, <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, said he'd wait to see whether <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> follows through on domestic needs. `` I hope so, but I'm very concerned about his budget, which is looking for cuts of over $ 5 billion in <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> and a number of other areas which will have a devastating effect on health care and important human needs,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>'s Democratic Gov. <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> gave <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> `` generally good marks for at least establishing a kinder and gentler theme, a desire to work cooperatively with the states.'' The governors received a grim budget assessment from <PERSON> Sasser </PERSON>, however, who said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s budget is based on overly optimistic economic assumptions and leaves the tough decisions about where to cut domestic spending up to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. `` The sad reality of our fiscal circumstances is that there's substantial pain to be portioned out to the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people and I'm sorry to say that the portion of that pain likely to fall to state and local government is, once again, very substantial,'' said He said that while <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has asked for a line-item veto power over the budget, a tool many governors have, `` he refuses to offer the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> this year a line-item budget.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s budget proposal calls for spending limits without specifying many of the cuts that will be needed to accomplish the goals. <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Clinton </PERSON>, a Democrat, voiced concern that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s budget proposal has no money for the $ 800 million job training program that was part of the welfare reform pushed by the governors and enacted by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Blanchard </PERSON> said the states are hard-pressed to deal with new obligations mandated by the federal government, such as for expanded Medicaid coverage, without money to pay for them. Former Secretary of State <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Kissinger </PERSON> spoke to the governors and cautioned against high expectations of expanded trade with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. To <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>'s Gov. <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Branstad </PERSON>, who asked about the prospects of increased trade with the Soviets, <PERSON> Kissinger </PERSON> said, `` I do n't think it's going to stimulate the economy of your state during your term of office.'' The governors' association executive committee approved resolutions putting the governors on record in support of self-determination for <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>, uniform poll closing times across the country, and easier voter registration. But a deficit-reduction plan that could have called for higher taxes under certain circumstances was withheld from a vote when what appeared to be a bipartisan consensus fell apart. The co-chairmen of the governors' task force that worked on the plan, Democrat <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and Republican <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON> <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON> of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, backed off late last week after <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> said it would incorporate a federal tax increase. <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON> said through spokesman <PERSON> Tucker </PERSON> <PERSON> Eskew </PERSON> that he wanted to strike language calling for higher taxes even `` in a doomsday scenario.''

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> today agreed to use a case from the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Virgin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Islands </ORGANIZATION> to decide whether federal juries may be told about a defendant's alleged prior criminal conduct if a previous trial on those charges ended in acquittal. The justices said they will review the bank robbery conviction and 70-year prison sentence of <PERSON> Reuben </PERSON> <PERSON> Dowling </PERSON>. Federal prosecutors said <PERSON> Dowling </PERSON> used a ski mask and a pistol to rob $ 7,000 from the <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pennsylvania </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Frederiksted </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Croix </LOCATION>, on July 8, 1985. At his trial, prosecutors introduced evidence of <PERSON> Dowling </PERSON>'s alleged robbery of a private home weeks after the bank robbery occurred <PERSON> Dowling </PERSON> previously had been tried and acquitted of charges stemming from the residential robbery. A federal trial judge allowed prosecutors to introduce such evidence, and the <ORGANIZATION> 3rd </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> upheld that ruling. The appeals court said the evidence should not have been admitted but its use was `` harmless'' _ meaning that <PERSON> Dowling </PERSON> would have been convicted even if it had not been used. In the appeal acted on today, <PERSON> Dowling </PERSON> argued that telling jurors about a crime for which he was acquitted violated his constitutional rights and should not have been ruled harmless error. <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> lawyers argued that the evidence should not have been ruled inadmissible. They said that although six federal appeals courts have barred such evidence, three federal appeals courts have allowed it. The case is <PERSON> Dowling </PERSON> vs. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION>, 88-6025.

 The ice patrol ship Endurance today rescued 65 scientists and sailors from a Peruvian ocean research vessel that ran aground in an <LOCATION> Antarctic </LOCATION> storm, the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> said. The 1,980-ton <PERSON> Humboldt </PERSON> was taking on water after hitting rocks Sunday night off King <LOCATION> George </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, about 500 miles south of the tip of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, the ministry said. Endurance, which recently underwent emergency repairs after an iceberg knocked a hole in its hull, went to the rescue, the ministry said. Seamen from the Endurance and the repair ship <PERSON> Stena </PERSON> <PERSON> Seaspread </PERSON> were put aboard the stricken vessel, but the Humboldt's crew was evacuated as conditions rapidly worsened. The Endurance was taking the Peruvians to <LOCATION> Marsh </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Base </LOCATION>, a Chilean station in <LOCATION> Antarctica </LOCATION>, the ministry said. The Stena Seaspread would stand by the Humboldt for two or three days to monitor pollution and assist in any salvage work, the ministry said. The Chilean navy said in a communique that its search and rescue center was put on alert and that no oil spill has occurred. The 1,980-ton Humboldt is listing slightly and was in no immediate danger of sinking, the Chilean communique said. The site is about 300 miles from the area where the Argentine ship <ORGANIZATION> Bahia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Paraiso </ORGANIZATION> ran aground and sank Jan. 28, spilling fuel oil. The spill was cleaned up by ships from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>. Damage to the environment is being evaluated by experts.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state and the federal government have reached an agreement over cleaning up the <LOCATION> Hanford </LOCATION> nuclear reservation, which has become the most contaminated of the nation's nuclear weapons production facilities <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Booth </PERSON> <PERSON> Gardner </PERSON> and officials of the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> were signing the accord in a ceremony at the Capitol today. According to a draft summary of the 300-page `` Hanford Action Cleanup Action Plan'' circulated on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>: _ $ 2.8 billion will needed over the next five years to begin the cleanup effort. That is roughly twice what would be available under current budget guidelines that limit funding growth to 3 percent. _ Specific milestones will be included for actually cleaning up the reservation, including an accelerated schedule for removing pumpable liquids from 149 aging, single-shell underground tanks and constructing a vitrification plant to turn the wastes into a glass-like substance _ The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> has decided that the agreement will be enforceable, an issue that had been a key sticking point in negotiations In addition, the federal government has agreed to provide <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> $ 2.9 million over the next three years to fund the state's oversight role. If the needed congressional funding is provided and the agreement is carried forward, the clean-up effort could add 2,000 people to the Hanford payroll by 1994. The agreement was reached after more than a year of negotiations and amid threats that the state would seek a `` consent decree'' in court if negotiations failed. Besides being the most contaminated of the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s 16 weapons-productions sites, the 570-square mile reservation in south-central <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> is expected to be the most costly and longest to clean up. The Energy Department estimated in January that it could cost up to $ 57 billion to manage and clean up the radioactive and toxic wastes at the reservation and even then Hanford would n't be returned to a `` pristine'' condition. Stored at <LOCATION> Hanford </LOCATION> is more than 60 percent of the nation's high-level radioactive waste generated by weapons programs dating back to World War II According to some estimates, more than 200 billion gallons of liquid radioactive waste have been dumped directly into the soil at <LOCATION> Hanford </LOCATION> and roughly 1,200 sites are seriously contaminated. There have also been concerns that the contaminated liquids may be seeping into the groundwater deep beneath the reservation and could eventually reach the nearby <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>. Scientists at the reservation worked on the atomic bomb that was dropped on <LOCATION> Nagasaki </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, at the end of World War II. <PERSON> Hanford </PERSON> was one of the largest weapon's production complexes in the 1950s. At present, only one commercial nuclear power plant is operating at the reservation and the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> has announced plans to phase out all weapons production activities at the site.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> today agreed to decide whether the rights of white criminal defendants may be violated when blacks are excluded from serving as jurors in their trials. The justices said they will hear an appeal by <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Holland </PERSON>, a Chicago-area white man sentenced to 85 years in prison for rape, kidnaping and armed robbery. The high court in 1986 ruled that prosecutors never may disqualify potential jurors based on their race. The ruling dramatically curtailed the traditonally broad power of prosecutors to eliminate prospective jurors from trials by using peremptory, or automatic, challenges. But that case involved a black defendant and jurors of his race. The justices have not decided whether exclusion of black jurors in this manner can violate the rights of a white defendant. In <LOCATION> Holland </LOCATION>'s case, two blacks among the more than 30 prospective jurors were excluded by the prosecution from serving on the panel that eventually convicted him. Prosecutors said they were not motivated by racial considerations when they used their peremptory challenges to exclude the two blacks, a man and a woman, from the jury. The <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> said that as a white person <PERSON> Holland </PERSON> lacked legal standing to raise the issue of whether race played a part in the exclusion of the two blacks. `` We decline to address this issue because we find that the defendant, a Caucasian, does not have standing to assert -LRB- such a constitutional -RRB- violation,'' the state court said. The state court also rejected <PERSON> Holland </PERSON>'s argument that he was denied his constitutional right to be tried by a fair cross-section of the community. <PERSON> Holland </PERSON> was convicted in the rape and kidnaping of a <LOCATION> Des </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plaines </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, teen-age girl on May 4, 1980. Prosecutors said <PERSON> Holland </PERSON> gave a ride to the girl and her boyfriend. They said he forced the boyfriend to leave the car and raped the girl at knifepoint. <PERSON> Holland </PERSON> was arrested hours after the assault when a police stopped his car because it had no rear license plate. The case is <LOCATION> Holland </LOCATION> vs. <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION>, 88-5050.

<HEAD>Court Will Look at Limits on Sexually Oriented Businesses in Dallas
Case</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> today agreed to take a fresh look at how far cities may go to limit sexually oriented businesses. The court will study a <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> zoning and licensing ordinance challenged by owners of adult bookstores, motion picture theaters, nightclubs, motels and nude-model studios. The challengers say the law violates their freedom of expression. Last week, the high court ruled in an <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> case that states may use anti-racketeering laws to crack down on pornography. But in that case the court also ruled that businesses dealing with sexually explicit materials may not be shut down before a judicial determination that at least some of the materials are obscene. The 1986 <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> ordinance requires that sexually oriented businesses be at least 1,000 feet apart and at least 1,000 feet from any church, school, residential area or park. Any existing business in violation of the regulation has three years to move or shut down. The businesses also are required to obtain a license issued by the chief of police, and must permit inspection of their premises during operating hours. Also, the ordinance bars anyone convicted of a variety of crimes, such as promotion of prostitution, from operating a sexually oriented business. And it requires that viewing rooms in adult theaters be open to permit surveillance by management. The regulations also bar motel owners from renting rooms for less than 10 hours, a provision designed to discourage prostitution. The 5th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> ruled last February that the ordinance is a legitimate attack on crime, urban blight and declining property values. The appeals court noted that the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in 1986 upheld a somewhat similar ordinance in <LOCATION> Renton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION>, restricting the location of adult theaters. Operators of adult entertainment outlets in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> said the regulations in the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> city are much stricter. They said dozens of businesses will be forced to shut down because at least 106 establishments must relocate and there are only 50 available locations. But the 5th Circuit court said the <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> ordinance does not violate free speech or other rights protected by the Constitution. The city council's `` consideration of the criminal effects of concentrated sexually oriented businesses was thorough, as was its review of the effects such concentrations have on property values,'' the appeals court said. `` In short, <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> has demonstrated that the ordinance furthers a substantial government interest.'' The appeals court also said the city demonstrated `` a compelling justification'' for its licensing requirements even though a less-strict standard would be adequate to uphold the regulations. For example, `` The city need only show that -LRB- a criminal -RRB- conviction and the evil to be regulated bear a substantial relationship,'' the appeals court said. It added that the discretion given the police chief under the ordinance to issue, suspend and revoke licenses is not impermissibly broad. The appeals court also rejected arguments that the city ordinance violates privacy rights by insisting that establishments offering sexually oriented entertainment be open to inspection by authorities without search warrants. In other action, the court: _ Agreed to decide whether the rights of white criminal defendants may be violated when blacks are excluded from serving as jurors in their trials. The justices said they will hear an appeal by <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Holland </PERSON>, a Chicago-area white man sentenced to 85 years in prison for rape, kidnaping and armed robbery. _ Turned down a challenge to his conviction by <PERSON> Bernhard </PERSON> <PERSON> Goetz </PERSON>, who in 1984 shot four young men he said were going to rob him on a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> subway. The court, without comment, rejected arguments that <PERSON> Goetz </PERSON> weas denied a fair trial. <PERSON> Goetz </PERSON>, who was sentenced to a year in jail and fined $ 5,000, began his imprisonment at the <LOCATION> Rikers </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> jail in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> last month. He is eligible for, but not assured of, parole after 51 days. _ Refused to revive an affirmative action program in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bend </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ind. </LOCATION>, that called for hiring more blacks and Hispanics as firefighters and police officers. The court, without comment, let stand a ruling that struck down the plan after it was challenged by a white man denied a job as a firefighter. _ Rejected `` reverse discrimination'' arguments by a white <LOCATION> Vallejo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, firefighter denied a promotion that went to a black man with a slightly lower test score. The court, without comment, let stand a ruling that upheld the black man's promotion to help achieve better racial balance within the fire department. _ Let stand a ruling that someone who plans a bank robbery but is arrested before actually moving toward the bank may not be convicted of violating a federal law prohibiting attempted bank robbery. The court, over two dissenting votes, rejected a <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> appeal that sought reinstatement of an attempted bank robbery conviction in a <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> case. _ Turned down appeals by former Rep. <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Biaggi </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, and former <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, Democratic boss <PERSON> Meade </PERSON> <PERSON> Esposito </PERSON> aimed at overturning their convictions for exchanging illegal gratuities. The court, without comment, cleared the way for <PERSON> Biaggi </PERSON>'s imprisonment on a 2 -LCB- - year <PERSON> Esposito </PERSON> was sentenced to two years probation and 500 hours of community service. The cases involving sexually oriented businesses are <ORGANIZATION> FW </ORGANIZATION> @ <ORGANIZATION> PBS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> vs. <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>, 87-2012; <ORGANIZATION> MJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> vs. <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>, 87-2051; and <PERSON> Berry </PERSON> vs. <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>, 88-49.

He made a brief stop in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> for refueling just before noon EST. The president's audience applauded when he pledged to keep the 42,000 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops on duty as protection against <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, but sat quietly when he talked of trade. `` I want you to have this direct from me: if we are to keep our bilateral relationships growing even stronger, much more needs to be done'' to ease trading relations, said the president. Although <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s South Korean visit was limited to five hours, a security force of 120,000 police, agents and commandos was put on top alert to protect him against threats ranging from radical students to North Korean infiltrators. About 700 radical students shouting `` <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> go home!'' battled riot police with firebombs and rocks during a 45-minute clash around <ORGANIZATION> Dongguk </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in an abortive attempt to march on the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> about three miles away. Earlier, police arrested about 15 prominent dissidents shouting `` no <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> visit'' who had tried to assemble about a block from the embassy in downtown <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>. Minutes after they were hauled away, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s helicopter flew overhead on its way to the <ORGANIZATION> Blue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, the nearby presidential mansion, after his arrival from <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> at a secure military base outside <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>. Police also clashed with demonstrators in five other cities, including the site of a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> air base south of <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>. From <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was flying back to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and the sternest political test so far of his young administration, the storm over the Tower nomination. The appointment is in danger of rejection in the Democratic-controlled <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, and the president has pledged to mount a personal lobbying campaign to salvage it. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s brief visit in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> included a luncheon for which the participants took off shoes and donned slippers. Guests sat on a heated floor on cushions with hard backs. But the 6-foot-2 <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had trouble stretching his legs, asking his hosts, `` Do you put your legs straight our or do you fold them up?'' The president made his rounds of <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> by helicopter as he met with President <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> Tae-woo _ a democratically elected leader who replaced the country's unpopular military dictatorship _ addressed the <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Korean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> and greeted <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Embassy employees. In the <ORGANIZATION> Blue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> meeting, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> held a 15-minute meeting that included discussions on the trade issue. `` <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> has benefitted from the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION>'s open market,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said in remarks to reporters after the session. <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> voiced support for free markets throughout the world. He said that both he and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had agreed to work to resolve `` various problems resulting from the rapid expansion of economic relations between our two countries.'' <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> said he had briefed <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on `` all our efforts for the reduction of tension and consolidation of peace on the <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> peninsula,'' including what he called `` a forward-looking policy toward <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> traveled to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, and his final hours in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> were marred when authorities prevented the nation's top dissident, <PERSON> Fang </PERSON> <PERSON> Lizhi </PERSON>, from attending a Sunday night banquet given by the visiting president. The White House said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> did not know of the incident at the time, but on his departure today from <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, expressed regret to Foreign Minister <PERSON> Wu </PERSON> <PERSON> Xueqian </PERSON>, according to <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> press secretary <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>. Contradicting a statement he made a day earlier, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> also said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> did raise the issue of human rights problems `` privately'' in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. The president's visit in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> was intended to reaffirm the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> commitment to Korean security while at the same time register concern about barriers to <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> exports to <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>, which has a nearly $ 9 billion trade surplus with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` I know that there must be times when this body, just like the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, is full of noise, contention and emotion,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said in his speech to the Assembly. `` But that is the sound of democracy at work and we would n't have it any other way,'' he said. <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> greeted <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s trip to the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> with a signed commentary in <PERSON> Rodong </PERSON> <PERSON> Sinmun </PERSON>, the organ of the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> of the ruling Korean Workers' -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- Party, declaring that the vow to keep <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> was `` a revelation of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> imperialists' unsatiated ambition for permanent occupation of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>.'' The commentary was reported in a broadcast of the official <ORGANIZATION> Korean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> that was monitored in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s trip came at a period of more public criticism of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policies than at any time in four decades. Radical students and dissidents complain that the presence of 42,000 troops hinders unification talks with the north. Farmers and businessmen charge that <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> is exerting undue pressure to liberalize Korean import rules. Pledging not to cut back on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said they will remain `` as long as they are needed and as long as we believe it is in the interest of peace to keep them there.'' He praised <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> as `` a world-class economic power'' and said `` your commitment to democracy is demonstrated daily in this chamber.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> called the Korean economy an inspiration to developing countries. Yet, he said, `` we also can not overlook that your economic success has created concerns'' in U.S.-Korean relations. `` For the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people and for the <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> people as well, reducing our bilateral trade imbalance will be both a challenge and an opportunity,'' the president said. `` The challenge will be to resist calls for protectionism; the opportunity will be to expand the prosperity of both our countries.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people `` share your goal of peaceful unification'' with the north `` on terms acceptable to the <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> people. It is for that reason that we actively support the peaceful initiatives of President <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> to build bridges to the north.'' On the eve of the visit in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s national security adviser, <PERSON> Brent </PERSON> <PERSON> Scowcroft </PERSON>, acknowledged that, `` There's been a lot of unrest'' in <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. `` There's been an anti-American tone to some of it. One of the reasons the president's going there is to reassure the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Koreans </LOCATION> of our support for their moves toward democracy and of the firmness of our strategic relationship. Asked if <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> was moving fast enough on human rights improvements, <PERSON> Scowcroft </PERSON> said, `` I think they're moving _ you know, fast enough? That's a very value judgment. I think they're moving. Koreans have gone a long way from where they were a short time ago. I think we need to be patient as they feel their way through toward a mature democratic system.''

 Rescue workers today found bodies of three more victims of storms that churned up 80 mph winds and killed 23 people across <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s western seaboard and <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> coast, officials said. Sunday's storms from <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> sank or disabled eight ships with waves as high as 30 feet. Rescue workers said 26 people remain missing and presumed dead today. At least 80 people were rescued. Calmer weather returned to <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION> today, but storms continued to lash northern <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>, western <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Loureiro </PERSON>, an official of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Meteorological </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Lisbon </LOCATION>, said winds had died down to as little as 6 mph. The Spanish Meteorological office issued storm warnings for extensive areas of the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> coasts. Winds could gust up to 50 mph in northwestern <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Finisterre </LOCATION>, said the institute. Mediterranean waves washed over dikes along the <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Riviera </LOCATION> on Sunday, inundating seaside restaurants at <LOCATION> Cannes </LOCATION> and washing over the Promenade <PERSON> des </PERSON> <PERSON> Anglais </PERSON> at <ORGANIZATION> Nice </ORGANIZATION>. French police reported a 62-year-old man was killed when a big wave knocked him against a wall, a nurse was caught by a 25-foot wave and drowned and another woman's body was recovered from the sea. There was a fourth death in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, on Saturday, when a young man was carried away by high waves and drowned.

In the most serious incident, a <LOCATION> Nigerian </LOCATION> cargo ship with 46 people aboard developed engine trouble two miles off <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Espichel </LOCATION>, a rocky promontory of <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION>. Gale-force winds and 16-foot waves drove the <LOCATION> 3,000-ton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gurara </LOCATION> onto the rocks and broke the ship in two, a spokesman for the <LOCATION> Portuguese </LOCATION> navy said. A Portuguese frigate picked up 27 people from lifeboats, he said. The navy said three more bodies were found today, bringing to seven the number of bodies recovered. `` It is almost impossible there are any more survivors,'' said Cmdr. <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Fidalgo </PERSON>. Off <LOCATION> Bordeaux </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, a Singapore-registered freighter issued a distress call and sank Saturday, and rescue workers searched fruitlessly Sunday for 14 sailors who were aboard.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>'s presidency imposed `` special measures'' in the southern province of <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION> today as military vehicles moved toward a mine where 1,300 workers remained underground on strike. Meanwhile, one of the miners' primary demands was met when the province's <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leader, <PERSON> Rahman </PERSON> <PERSON> Morina </PERSON>, resigned, the Yugolsav news agency <ORGANIZATION> Tanjug </ORGANIZATION> reported. There was no immediate response from the strikers, who had been holed up for eight days in the <ORGANIZATION> Trepca </ORGANIZATION> lead and zinc mines in <LOCATION> Titova </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mitrovica </LOCATION>. Military planes twice flew over <LOCATION> Pristina </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION>'s capital, and armed vehicles were seen heading toward <LOCATION> Titova </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mitrovica </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Tanjug </ORGANIZATION> said `` the presidency of <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> today ordered that special measures be introduced in <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION> for protecting the constitutional order.'' `` The implementation of these measures was effective immediately. The public has not yet been informed of the precise measures involved.'' The agency did not give further details on the `` special measures.'' The announcement came after <ORGANIZATION> Tanjug </ORGANIZATION> reported the miners said they were cutting off outside contacts, except for medical assistance, until <PERSON> Morina </PERSON> stepped down. He later resigned and <PERSON> Radio </PERSON> <PERSON> Belgrade </PERSON> quoted him as saying, `` I am deeply shaken that you consider me responsible for your lives and health. It is only for this purpose that I am submitting the resignation.'' But 800 miners from the Slav minority in <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION> descended into another lead and zinc mine today and said they would remain underground if <PERSON> Morina </PERSON> stepped down. Like the majority of miners, <PERSON> Morina </PERSON> is an ethnic <PERSON> Albanian </PERSON>. But the miners believe he is too supportive of <LOCATION> Serbia </LOCATION>, one of <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>'s six republics. <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION> is part of <LOCATION> Serbia </LOCATION> but is actually an autonomous province. The miners fear that proposals to change <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>'s constitution would increase <LOCATION> Serbia </LOCATION>'s control of the province. Serbian leaders claim tighter control is necessary to protect the Slav minority, which claims persecution by the ethnic Albanians. The ethnic Albanian miners also have demanded the resignations of <PERSON> Husamedin </PERSON> <PERSON> Azemi </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leader in <LOCATION> Pristina </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Sukrija </PERSON>, a representative of <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION> in the national party leadership. <PERSON> Azemi </PERSON> also resigned today, citing `` moral considerations and ... blackmail.'' <PERSON> Sukrija </PERSON> can only submit his resignation to the federal leadership in <LOCATION> Belgrade </LOCATION>. Earlier today, the Communist leadership of <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> appealed to the miners to `` stop imperiling your health and lives'' and come out of the mine, <ORGANIZATION> Tanjug </ORGANIZATION> reported. At least 550 exhausted miners have requested medical assistance, the news agency said. On Saturday, the presidency _ a nine-man collective body that commands <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>'s armed forces _ ordered greater internal security in <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION> and extra police units were brought in. More police than usual patrolled <LOCATION> Pristina </LOCATION> streets today, and soldiers guarded key buildings and army barracks. Police roadblocks were seen on some roads leading into <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION>, travelers reported. <PERSON> Riza </PERSON> <PERSON> Muslimi </PERSON>, a spokesman for the strikers, said Saturday that they had stashed two tons of explosives underground. He refused to say if they planned to blow up the mining complex if their demands, which include management changes at the mine, were n't met. <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>'s economy has deteriorated since 1980 and the nation's standard of living has been in steep decline The jobless rate last year was 15 percent, and citizens staged huged demonstrations calling for changes in the nation's leadership.

 Federal prosecutors were preparing to tell a bloody tale of restaurant rubouts, a `` contract'' to assassinate reputed mob boss <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Gotti </PERSON> and Mafia control of construction as the trial of six alleged organized crime figures opened today. Jury selection began today, and opening arguments were scheduled to start next week. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Maryanne </PERSON> <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> granted the government's request for an anonymous jury _ a first for a federal trial in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> _ because of the nature of the case. The trial is expected to shed light on organized crime violence in the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> metropolitan area, and may help solve a string of mob-related murders dating back 12 years. It also will mark the courtroom debut of <PERSON> Vincent </PERSON> `` Fish'' <PERSON> Cafaro </PERSON> as a prosecution witness. <PERSON> Cafaro </PERSON> is a former associate of jailed and aging former Genovese boss <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> `` Fat Tony'' <PERSON> Salerno </PERSON>. He testified last year before <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> about life in the mob and its activities. Ms. <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> said the case `` makes no pretense of being other than an organized crime case in which the inner workings of the Mafia will be hammered home.'' The main defendants, indicted in June, are reputed Genovese `` consigliere,'' or No. 3 leader, <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> A. `` <PERSON> Bobby </PERSON><PERSON> '' </PERSON> <PERSON> Manna </PERSON>, 59; his deputy, restaurant owner <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> `` Motts'' <PERSON> Casella </PERSON>, 71; and <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> `` Bocci'' DeSciscio, 42, termed an enforcer for the group. The three are being held without bail. They and the other defendants _ <PERSON> Rocco </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Napoli </PERSON>, 42, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Derrico </PERSON>, 27, and <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> `` Dipsy'' <PERSON> Daniello </PERSON>, 67, _ are charged with racketeering. The racketeering charge includes allegations of controlling labor unions, extorting construction industry figures, trafficking in stolen goods, loan sharking, illegal gambling, murder and murder conspiracy. All deny the charges and organized crime ties. Much of the government's case rests on 2,500 hours of taped conversations recorded in a back room of a <LOCATION> Hoboken </LOCATION> restaurant from June 1987 to March 1988. Prosecutors said they will present evidence about a plot to kill <PERSON> Gotti </PERSON>, the flamboyant reputed boss of the Gambino crime family in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. Authorities have said the <PERSON> Genovese </PERSON> family was angry about Gambino incursions in northern <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> territory.

 Information exchanged by 20 law enforcement officers familiar with serial killer <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON> will be analyzed further to see if other crimes can be linked to him, the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> said today. `` Information exchanged at the conference will be used to build a model of homicides typically committed by <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON>,'' the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> said in a statement after a weeklong meeting of <LOCATION> Bundy </LOCATION> investigators ended. `` This model will be compared against crimes that are unsolved in which he remains a suspect. <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON> was executed Jan. 24 in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> for the 1978 murder of <PERSON> Kimberly </PERSON> <PERSON> Diane </PERSON> <PERSON> Leach </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla </LOCATION>. In the days before his death, <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON> confessed to 23 killings across the West, although he did not provide 23 names, and also gave information that authorities said might linke him to other cases. He had been convicted of three killings in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>.

 Former Prime Minister <PERSON> Yasuhiro </PERSON> <PERSON> Nakasone </PERSON> said Monday three of his aides had bought bargain shares in the company at the center of a stock-profiteering scandal, but he denied any personal involvement in the affair. `` I regret my aides' purchase of shares occurred because of my poor supervision,'' <PERSON> Nakasone </PERSON> said in a nationally televised news conference. `` But I am innocent and played no role in the scandal.'' The largest opposition party, the Socialists, expressed dissatisfaction with <PERSON> Nakasone </PERSON>'s remarks, and repeated demands the government summon him to testify before Parliament concerning the scandal. `` If we ca n't get a satisfactory response from the government, we are ready to boycott the remaining Parliament session.

The scandal involves sales to 150 influential politicians and businessmen of bargain-priced shares in <ORGANIZATION> Recruit-Cosmos </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> before the stock was listed for public sale. When public trading began, the share prices shot up and the bargain buyers profited handsomely. The scandal has shaken the government, and prosecutors have arrested eight people on charges of bribery or violating securities laws. <PERSON> Nakasone </PERSON>, who was prime minister in 1982-87, denied his involvement in the scandal for the first time in an interview last week with <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION>. Monday's news conference marked his first public comments to the Japanese on the affair. It also was the first time <PERSON> Nakasone </PERSON> publicly acknowledged that his aides bought shares in Recruit-Cosmos, a subsidiary of the information service conglomerate <ORGANIZATION> Recruit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co </ORGANIZATION>. He said the aides bought a total of 29,000 shares in September 1986 and sold them the following month. He did not say how much profit they made. Asked Monday if he would appear before <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Nakasone </PERSON> said: `` I do n't believe it is necessary now that I have made everything clear today, but I would follow the government's decision.'' He said he was to travel to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> on Tuesday to give lectures at several universities. <PERSON> Yatabe </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> would press the government to summon <PERSON> Nakasone </PERSON>, along with <PERSON> Hisashi </PERSON> <PERSON> Shinto </PERSON>, former chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Nippon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telegraph </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, and <PERSON> Ihei </PERSON> <PERSON> Aoki </PERSON>, former secretary to Prime Minister <PERSON> Noboru </PERSON> <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>. Opposition parties say they suspect <PERSON> Nakasone </PERSON> directed the giant telephone utility to buy two supercomputers from a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> manufacturer and sell them to <ORGANIZATION> Recruit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co </ORGANIZATION>. The tranaction reportedly benefited Recruit significantly. Two former <ORGANIZATION> Nippon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telegraph </ORGANIZATION> vice presidents are among those who have been arrested in the scandal. More than 20 prominent people, including former Finance Minister <PERSON> Kiichi </PERSON> <PERSON> Miyazawa </PERSON> and two other <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> ministers, have resigned because of links to the affair.

<HEAD>Moderate Quake Rattles South-Central Utah</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SALINA, Utah (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A moderate earthquake rattled south-central <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> today, and seismologists said the temblor was an unusual late aftershock of a larger quake that struck the same area a month earlier. The <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Utah </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Seismograph </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stations </ORGANIZATION> reported the quake measured 4.2 on the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale and was centered 16 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Salina </LOCATION> in a remote, mountainous area of the Sevier Plateau. It caused no apparent damages or injuries, but was felt by residents in <LOCATION> Sevier </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Emery </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Sanpete </LOCATION> counties, said senior staff seismologist <PERSON> Sue </PERSON> <PERSON> Nava </PERSON>. A quake of magnitude 5.4 that struck Jan. 29 was located in the same precise spot, <PERSON> Nava </PERSON> said. Today's temblor was an aftershock of the larger quake, which caused minor damage and was reported felt throughout <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> and parts of <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>. `` It is somewhat unusual, but certainly possible'' for an aftershock to occur a month later, <PERSON> Nava </PERSON> said. The latest quake also occurred deeper than most, rumbling about 15 miles underground, she added. Since the January quake there have been about 50 aftershocks along the <LOCATION> Sevier </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plateau </LOCATION>, but most were too small to be felt, she said. The <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on seismographs. Every increase of one number means a tenfold increase in magnitude. An earthquake of 4 on the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale can cause moderate damage in the local area.

 <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tower </PERSON>'s pledge to swear off alcohol if approved as <ORGANIZATION> defense </ORGANIZATION> secretary left two undecided <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> unmoved today and pledging they will go over all evidence on the nominee's character before deciding how to vote. A third Democratic senator considered by some a swing vote, <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, said he is leaning against the nomination despite Tower's pledge. `` I think it -LRB- the pledge -RRB- helps, but it's not just the drinking which is a problem to me,'' <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>. `` It's a pattern of bad judgment _ bad judgment in the 1970s in drinking, bad judgment by placing himself in compromising positions as the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> arms negotiator in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> in the mid-80s, bad judgment in accepting large sums from the defense industry in the late 1980s.'' Sen. <PERSON> Howell </PERSON> <PERSON> Heflin </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>, one of several <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> still considered open to the White House lobbying effort for Tower, said on <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Good Morning America,'' that he has `` to review all the evidence. I'm trying to be open-minded, judicial and fair about it.'' Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Breaux </PERSON>, D-La., said on the <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> program that he would vote against Tower if the vote were today despite the embattled nominee's extraordinary pledge on Sunday `` I think that if we have a serious doubt, if any senator has a serious doubt about the competence of a candidate, that he should err on the side of safety,'' said <PERSON> Breaux </PERSON>. `` In that case, it indicates voting negatively.'' Asked whether Tower's promise to refrain from drinking had swayed him, <PERSON> Heflin </PERSON> said he plans to read the classified <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> report on Tower today and `` will review the evidence of the drinking problem.'' <PERSON> Heflin </PERSON> said he will consider `` does he have a drinking problem that might be a detriment to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> national security'' and `` does he have a temptation propensity that might return to drink.'' Sen. <PERSON> Orrin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hatch </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Utah </LOCATION>, said on <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> `` This Morning,'' meanwhile, that Tower's vow should put the drinking questions to rest `` because <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tower </PERSON> is a man of his word. ... So I think that particular issue ought to be gone.'' <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Maine </LOCATION>, held a late-morning meeting on the Tower nomination with Minority Leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, R-Kan. Neither would comment afterward. Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Warner </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, ranking Republican on the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said he would have no comment on Tower's pledge The senator said he would be `` meeting with colleagues off and on during the day.'' <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> planned to meet with President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on Tuesday to discuss the nomination. Tower made his pledge against the alcohol in televised interviews Sunday, saying he would be `` obliged to resign'' if he broke the vow. At the same time, Sen. <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON>, D-Ga., said he might reconvene <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> confirmation hearings to hear testimony in public about the former <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> senator's drinking habits The committee chairman coupled his statement with a complaint that the White House was leaking information from the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>'s background report on Tower in a bid to rescue the nomination <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> also expressed concern about Tower's ties to defense consultants and the appearance of conflict of interest. Over a two-year period, Tower received more than $ 1 million in consulting fees from such industry giants as <ORGANIZATION> Rockwell </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Marietta </PERSON>. The <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> senator, in the <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> interview, noted that Tower served as a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> arms control negotiator in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> and then advised defense companies on arms control efforts on the weapons they build. `` It's a tough line to draw,'' <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> said. `` But I do believe that <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tower </PERSON> crossed that line.'' <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON>'s Democratic-controlled committee voted 11-9 along party lines last Thursday to recommend that the full <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> reject Tower's nomination, with the chairman citing allegations of excessive drinking by the nominee The comments today and Sunday were a prelude to an intense week of political maneuvering over the nomination, which the full <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> is expected to debate beginning at midweek. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> intends to take personal charge of the lobbying campaign for Tower, and has invited several Democrats to the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> to discuss the issue later in the week. But Tower was n't waiting for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to return home from his Asian trip. `` Noting the principal concern of Senator <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> and other members of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> relative to my confirmation as secretary of <ORGANIZATION> defense </ORGANIZATION>, namely the extent to which I may engage in excessive use of beverage alcohol, let me state that I have never been an alcoholic nor dependent on alcohol,'' <PERSON> Tower </PERSON> said in a statement he read on <ORGANIZATION> ABC-TV </ORGANIZATION>'s `` This Week With <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Brinkley </PERSON>'' and <ORGANIZATION> Cable </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Newsmaker Sunday. `` I hearby swear and undertake that if confirmed, during the course of my tenure as secretary of defense, I will not consume beverage alcohol of any type or form, including wine, beer or spirits of any kind,'' he said. Tower also vowed that if he broke his pledge not to drink, he would step down. `` I think I'd be obliged to resign if I broke the pledge. I've never broken a pledge in my life,'' said the former senator. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> called Tower's pledge `` very, very significant'' and urged Democrats and Republicans to reassess the nomination. `` My view is it ought to be a new ball game. We ought to sit down and try to work it out and spare any hard feelings,'' <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> said Tower's pledge `` is another factor to be considered.'' <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> had no comment on Tower's pledge, according to <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON> <PERSON> Punaro </PERSON>, a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> staff. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> begins courting undecided Democrats on Tuesday in hopes of capturing enough votes for Tower to win confirmation. Democrats hold a 55-45 majority in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, meaning <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> must pick up at least five Democrats to assure Tower's confirmation. Tower, in the interviews, also read from a letter from his doctor saying tests last month found that he had normal liver functions and there was no evidence of alcohol impairment or alcoholism. In the interview with <ORGANIZATION> CNN </ORGANIZATION>, Tower acknowledged that he was a heavy drinker during the 1970s but denied that he had a drinking problem. `` Drank to excess. I would n't say that I had a problem. That is to say, I was n't hooked on it; I was n't dependent on it. I did drink too much,'' he said. On the <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> program, the onetime chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> and former <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> arms control negotiator conceded that there was a point in his life when he changed his drinking habits. `` Twelve years ago, I gave up spirits. I used to be a pretty good scotch drinker. I have n't tasted scotch in 12 years. After that I had only wine, and perhaps an occasional martini, occasionally a little vodka with smoked salmon, caviar, something like that. That was just occasionally. `` I really essentially -LRB- have -RRB- been a wine drinker. Now my only consumption is wine at meals.'' Tower has been dogged by allegations of both excessive drinking and womanizing. Pressed by interviewer <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Donaldson </PERSON> about whether he would pledge not to see women, the former senator asked the <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> newsman to define womanizer in what became a heated exchange. `` Now, when allegations are raised that you're a womanizer, should you take a pledge not to go out with women?'' <PERSON> Donaldson </PERSON> asked. `` I'm a single man. I do date women,'' said the twice-divorced Tower.

<HEAD>Death Toll Triples Average in 1988 Earthquakes</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Earthquake deaths last year nearly tripled the world's annual average, largely as a result of the tragic Armenian tremor, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Geological </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Survey </ORGANIZATION> reported Monday. The year's loss of life in earth tremors was the worst in more than a decade and occurred despite a decline in the total number of significant earthquales reported during the year, Survey officials reported. The exact number of deaths remains unknown, but is likely nearly triple the average annual toll of about 10,000 fatalities worldwide. A year earlier, in 1987, only 1,100 lives had been lost in earthquakes. The 1988 toll is the most since 1976 when at least 250,000 people were killed in an earthquake in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. The Geological Survey said it is using a low estimate of 25,000 deaths in the Dec. 7 tremor in <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>. That figure is the Soviet government estimate. Some other reports have been much higher. The Armenian quake, with a magnitude of 6.8 on the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale, also injured 13,000 people and left more than a half-million homeless. The main shock was followed within minutes by a second tremor, measuring 5.8 on the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale, which estimates the energy released by a tremor. A quake of 5.0 can cause considerable damage, and the strength rises by 10 times for each whole number on the scale. Collapsing buildings were blamed for many of the deaths in <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> as the quake rattled concrete structures until they fell to the ground, according to subsequent analyses. Another quake in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, claiming about 1,000 lives, later struck in Soviet central <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>. That tremor occurred in January, however, and so does not count in the 1988 toll. The second most deadly quake of 1988 came on Aug. 20, when about 1,000 people died as a result of a tremor on the Nepal-India border. That quake measured 6.6 on the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale. It destroyed thousands of homes and injured many. On Nov. 6, a quake measuring 7.3 on the scale claimed 730 lives and injured about 4,000 people on the border between <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, the Geological Survey reported. And on the India-Burma border three deaths were reported in an Aug. 6 quake that caused landslides. The Survey said it recorded 61 significant quakes last year, 15 fewer than the year before. A quake is considered significant if it has a magnitude of 6.5 on the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale. Tremors of lesser magnitude are included if they cause casualties or considerable damage. Three significant quakes were recorded in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> last year including the strongest shock of the year. That tremor, measured at 7.6, occurred March 6 in the Gulf of <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> and resulted in only minor damage. The only <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> earthquake death last year was a heart attack following a quake measured at 4.8 in <LOCATION> Whittier </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, in February. The other significant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> quake occurred Dec. 3 in <LOCATION> Pasadena </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif </LOCATION>. It was measured at 4.6 on the scale but caused some injuries and property damage. A quake centered in eastern <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> on Nov. 25 was felt widely across that country and in the northeastern <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> as far south as <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, the survey reported. It had a magnitude of 5.7. Quakes in the eastern part of <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> tend to be felt over larger areas than tremors of similar strength in the West. <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> recorded three earthquake deaths last year when a tremor rated at 3.0 killed a group of miners in <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> on Sept. 2. In addition a tremor rated at 5.8 caused several injuries in <LOCATION> Albania </LOCATION> on Jan. 9. Injuries were also reported from two offshore quakes, one in the <LOCATION> Ionian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> near <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> Oct. 16 and another near the <LOCATION> Azores </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION> Nov. 21. In <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, eight persons working in a gold mine in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> died Jan. 5 in an earthquake rated at 5.2. And <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, usually very seismically active, recorded only one significant quake last year, the Survey reported. That tremor measured 5.4 and resulted in 10 injuries and minor damage in the <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> area.

<HEAD>American Psychiatrists to Examine Soviet Mental Patients</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARK J. PORUBCANSKY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A team of American psychiatrists is embarking on a two-week review of Soviet psychiatry including interviews with two dozen patients Western human rights activists suspect are being held for political reasons. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> says it has ended abuses and is interested in rejoining the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Psychiatry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, from which it withdrew in 1983 under pressure from Western countries that accused it of using psychiatry for political purposes. `` The purpose of our visit will be to assess, insofar as possible and in a limited period of time, changes in Soviet policies, laws and treatment practices in the field of forensic psychiatry,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Farrand </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official leading the 20-member team. He described the visit, which ends March 12, as unprecedented. Soviet human rights activists said recently that 20-30 mentally healthy people still are held in mental hospitals for political reasons. <PERSON> Loren </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Roth </PERSON>, head of the Law and Psychiatry program at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pittsburgh </ORGANIZATION> and the medical leader, said the group expects to interview 25-30 Soviets whose cases have been raised by Western human rights campaigners. `` These are the patients whose cases are perhaps best known,'' he said. <PERSON> Farrand </PERSON> told reporters Monday the Soviets are giving the group access to all the patients whose cases they asked to review, but delegation officials added there was no way they could ensure other people unknown to human rights activists are not being held for political reasons. Delegation members said they have been given medical records for most of the patients, and expect to receive more before they begin examinations. Patients will be given a choice of speaking only to the American group, or to have a Soviet psychiatrist present as well, they said. The American group includes five psychiatrists who are former Soviet citizens. They will conduct the interviews in Russian and screen out any cultural bias in the examinations, the group said. Patients will be tested for any drugs that are being administered, and the delegation has asked Soviet psychiatrists to present the patients as they normally live. The group eventually will issue a report on its findings, but wo n't identify the patients to protect their privacy. One official said the group planned to avoid publicity while in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> because `` the chemistry of this is very delicate.'' It also will visit two psychiatric hospitals that human rights activists say once held political prisoners and two that never have been so identified. Delegation officials said the visits to the latter would allow them to assess the general state of Soviet psychiatric care. Abuse of psychiatry in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has been a contentious issue between the superpowers for decades. As part of <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s reforms, some psychiatric hospitals were transferred from police control to control by the <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>. A new law made it a crime to commit a sane person to a mental hospital. Last month, <PERSON> Georgy </PERSON> <PERSON> Morozov </PERSON>, head of the Soviet psychiatric society, said there were no more people held in psychiatric hospitals for political reasons. Officials of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> delegation said their investigation was not directly aimed at <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s effort to be readmitted to the world association, but that the issue was likely to come up when the organization meets in October.

 President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s confrontation with the last <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON> man on the Politburo has ignited rising local opposition to stubborn old guard of the <LOCATION> Ukraine </LOCATION> `` For a long time, people's mouths were sewn shut,'' said <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON> <PERSON> Drach </PERSON>, a writer who heads the <LOCATION> Narodni </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rykh </LOCATION>, or <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION>. `` Now people in many situations are seeking to speak out.'' In a four-day campaign through the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s second most populous republic last week, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> ordered <ORGANIZATION> Ukrainian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> boss <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> Shcherbitsky </PERSON> and his political machine to start backing perestroika. The Ukrainian government responded with a crackdown on protesters, arresting human rights activists within hours of <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s departure. On Sunday, paramilitary police shoved 6,000 people from a downtown square when speeches at a cultural rally turned to politics. The <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> showdown coincided with a <LOCATION> Ukrainian </LOCATION> reform movement that in the last three months has shaken off 17 years of repression under <PERSON> Shcherbitsky </PERSON>. The Narodni Rykh, formed in November but not permitted to publish its program until 10 days ago, is one of several new organizations in <LOCATION> Kiev </LOCATION> calling for change. The new Ukrainian Language Society on Jan. 27 persuaded the republic's parliament to begin work on a law making Ukrainian the official language, a society seeking to reveal the crimes of dictator <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> is getting organized, and a <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elections </ORGANIZATION> is protesting the removal of certain candidates from balloting for the new parliament. As <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s calls for modernization in the <LOCATION> Ukraine </LOCATION> dominated Soviet TV news last week, <PERSON> Shcherbitsky </PERSON> was shown standing stone-faced behind the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> leader. `` We always had these ideas,'' said <PERSON> Boris </PERSON> <PERSON> Oliinyk </PERSON>, a reformer on the <ORGANIZATION> Ukrainian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. `` We just could n't work on them earlier. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> called reform leaders into a meeting of <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> officials and sided with the reformers. <PERSON> Shcherbitsky </PERSON> sat and listened, two elated reformers said afterward. The <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> leader also ordered <ORGANIZATION> Ukrainian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leaders to pay more attention to democratization, elected bodies and rank-and-file party members. He told workers on the streets of <LOCATION> Kiev </LOCATION> they should oust bosses who do n't perform well. Reversing local authorities, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> also promised that a controversial nuclear power plant would n't begin operations unless declared safe by American experts. In setting <LOCATION> Ukrainian </LOCATION> activists free to push for change, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> risks igniting nationalism. But his attempt to overhaul the nation's economy can not succeed without reform in the <LOCATION> Ukraine </LOCATION> _ the industrial and agricultural heart of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> himself brought up the danger of Ukrainian nationalism, warning miners in <LOCATION> Donetsk </LOCATION> that the country could not afford ethnic disturbances in a republic of 50 million people when strife in the smaller republics of <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION> was so damaging. <PERSON> Drach </PERSON> said <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> has allowed <PERSON> Shcherbitsky </PERSON> to remain in power this long because of this `` fear of stirring up the <LOCATION> Ukraine </LOCATION> to the boiling point.'' As a result, the <LOCATION> Ukraine </LOCATION> has seen virtually no glasnost, activists said. Crimes of <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> being examined by a Politburo commission and the national press are out of bounds for Ukrainian newspapers. Demonstrations that have met little or no resistance in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Baltics </ORGANIZATION> have been broken up in the <LOCATION> Ukraine </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Oles </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevchenko </PERSON>, head of the local <ORGANIZATION> Helsinki </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Watch </ORGANIZATION> group. Economic innovations such as private cooperatives and leasing have been rare, said writer <PERSON> Yuri </PERSON> <PERSON> Shcherbak </PERSON>. Environmental concerns about radiation from the <LOCATION> Chernobyl </LOCATION> nuclear power plant explosion have been ignored. Demonstrators in <LOCATION> Kiev </LOCATION> last week called for <PERSON> Shcherbitsky </PERSON>'s defeat in the upcoming election, although he is running unopposed. At the conclusion of Sunday's rally on the preservation of ancient <LOCATION> Kiev </LOCATION>, paramilitary police stormed the square after human rights activists announced their demonstrations had been canceled since <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s departure because of the arrest of protest organizers. Some in the crowd responded to the strong-armed tactics of the police with anger, screaming, `` Nazis!'' <PERSON> Shcherbak </PERSON> said the burgeoning populist movements have their roots in public anger over the Chernobyl disaster. Government secrecy about the resulting radiation sparked an environmental movement that won permission to hold a meeting in November that drew an estimated 20,000 people.

Where Ukrainians once were afraid to mention <PERSON> Shcherbitsky </PERSON>'s name, there now are open calls for his ouster. `` People lack faith in the old leaders, particularly <PERSON> Shcherbitsky </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Drach </PERSON> said. `` He is old, sick and he must go,'' said <PERSON> Shcherbak </PERSON>. `` I think he will go soon.

<HEAD>Head of New Veterans Department Sees No Additional Money</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GUY DARST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Cabinet status for the Veterans Administration does not automatically mean more money, the man designated to head the new department told the nation's largest veterans group Monday. `` We realize that with the budget problems facing this administration, we're not going to be the priority group,'' <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Derwinski </PERSON> told an <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Legion </ORGANIZATION> meeting. `` We do n't want any false expectations, any false hopes in the field.'' After his speech, <PERSON> Derwinski </PERSON> told reporters he does not believe he will be able to win extra money for the new department in the current fiscal year. It was his first such admission, though he earlier had said he had not won over the <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> to his view that the <ORGANIZATION> Veterans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> needs more funds. A Legion spokesman said supplemental funds were essential this year. The VA on March 15 becomes the Department of Veterans Affairs, the government's newest and second-largest Cabinet department. <PERSON> Derwinski </PERSON> is scheduled to go before the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Veterans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday for a closed hearing that is expected to delve into his admitted tipping off of the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> embassy in 1975 that a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Korean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> was about to defect. On Monday, <PERSON> Derwinski </PERSON> began his speech with the warning, `` The first thing we have to appreciate, and it is n't easy to accept, is that there is n't an automatic pot of gold at the end of the rainbow merely by being called a department,'' He returned to that theme several times. Though <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> intended to enhance the influence of the agency both inside and outside the administration through elevation to Cabinet status, he said, `` it is n't something that is going to happen overnight. It's going to take time, it's going to take salesmanship, it's going to take special effort.'' Speaking with reporters afterward, <PERSON> Derwinski </PERSON> said he was seeking an extra $ 520 million for the 1990 fiscal year beginning Oct. 1, almost all of it for medical care. `` If there is an'89 supplemental, which I doubt, we'll have a shot there,'' he said. Veterans Administration officials have said since fall the $ 10.8 billion budgeted for medical care this year is $ 600 million to $ 1 billion short, and the veterans committees of both houses have urged the administration to seek additional funds. Last week, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Veterans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> recommended to the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> additional spending this year of $ 520 million, 83 percent of it for medical care, and $ 1.3 billion more for next year, 85 percent of it for medical care. Total spending by the <ORGANIZATION> Veterans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> is budgeted at $ 29.77 billion in the current year. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> proposed $ 29.96 billion for 1990, of which $ 10.99 billion would be for medical care. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Hanson </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Legion </ORGANIZATION>, said when told that <PERSON> Derwinski </PERSON> did not expect a supplemental appropriation in the current fiscal year, `` I think we'd be terribly disappointed. It's essential. `` It's a terrifying thought that they'd start closing more beds'' in the 130 VA hospitals, <PERSON> Hanson </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Sparky </PERSON> <PERSON> Gierke </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Bismarck </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.D. </LOCATION>, national commander of the American Legion, exhorted <PERSON> Derwinski </PERSON> after the speech to be `` the strong voice of the veterans, and carry the water of the American veteran and not that of the Office of Management and Budget.''

 Federal agents apprehended 79 suspected illegal aliens today as an <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> flight from <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> made a stopover here. `` We believe this is one of the largest operations we've conducted that involves illegal aliens on board commercial aircraft here in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Fischer </PERSON>, district director of the <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> office of the Immigration and <ORGANIZATION> Naturalization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> `` This may be part of a massive alien smuggling operation,'' he said, adding that the <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> would continue to target such flights. <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> agents, acting on tips from confidential sources at <LOCATION> Hartsfield </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> and from undercover operations around <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, boarded the plane shortly after its arrival, said <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>. The plane was bound for <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` We had about 25 immigration agents on the case,'' <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION>' sources indicated it had been `` a regular occurrence'' for the past 30 days for illegal aliens to use the same flight, and he estimated that thousands of illegal aliens had been smuggled across the country on Eastern airliners. `` It appears at this point from our sources that it's almost a daily occurrence,'' he said. He said he did n't know how the aliens had gotten into the country. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> had been very cooperative in the investigation, adding, `` We do n't in any way connect <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> and do n't want to intimate that they were even remotely involved at this point.'' In <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> today, <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Virginia </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanchez </PERSON> said, `` All I know is that the <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> had told us they'd be monitoring a flight this week and, of course, we cooperated with them.'' Thirty-nine of the suspected aliens were from <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, 22 from <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION>, 13 from the <LOCATION> Dominican </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>, three from <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> and one each from <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ecuador </LOCATION>. They were to be transferred to <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> processing centers in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> for deportations, he said. They were among 179 passengers who boarded in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. `` We suspect that a smuggler assists them in boarding the aircraft in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> said, adding that the aliens likely are greeted in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> by relatives and another smuggler.

<HEAD>Prince Charles Back Skiing a Year After Fatal Avalanche</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KLOSTERS, Switzerland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Prince <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> began a Swiss skiing vacation Monday and passed the site of an avalanche that killed one of his close friends and seriously injured another a year ago. Shortly after arrival in this alpine resort, the prince's group rode a cable car up the same mountain where the snowslide struck March 10, 1988. He hardly appeared to look when the cabin passed near the spot. The party skied down the <LOCATION> Gotschna </LOCATION> mountain south of the accident site. Authorities listed a moderate avalanche danger for the region. The heir to the British throne was accompanied by <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Palmer-Tomkinson </PERSON>, who was skiing with the prince when the avalanche struck and whose wife, <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON>, suffered broken legs. Also along for the run Monday were <PERSON> Charles </PERSON>' ski teacher <PERSON> Bruno </PERSON> <PERSON> Sprecher </PERSON> and a Swiss policeman. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON>, 40, is expected to spend the week at the royal family's traditional winter holiday resort Princess <PERSON> Diana </PERSON> was not among the party. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> narrowly escaped injury in last year's avalanche, which roared down on a group of skiers he was leading on a steep run off marked trails.

 Along the wide and immaculately clean streets of <LOCATION> Pyongyang </LOCATION>, women with their heads wrapped in white scarfs and men bundled up against the winter morning cold trudge off to work. Most walk alone, their faces stern, their steps steady. Many wear a tiny enamel picture pin of President <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Il </PERSON> <PERSON> Sung </PERSON>, the omnipotent dictator who has ruled the Communist nation throughout its four decades of existence. <LOCATION> Pyongyang </LOCATION> is the capital of one of the world's most insular and repressive countries, which is frequently accused of terrorist activity and basic human rights violations. But this hermit of the world has begun to show stirrings of more contact with the outside world, particularly with its two main foes, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. The Korean peninsula was divided into a communist North and capitalist South after World War II. Although the two sides have yet to sign a peace treaty after their 1950-1953 war, they are engaged in cautious attempts to ease tension by talking about topics ranging from a non-agression pact to trade. Meanwhile, North Korean and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> diplomats recently met in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s capital, in a rare display of direct contact. In July, <LOCATION> Pyongyang </LOCATION> will play host to the 13th World Festival of Youth and Students, a gathering of communist and socialist youth groups that <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> expects will attract about 20,000 delegates from more than 100 nations. The city also is under consideration as site for the 1989 World Student Games. <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> eagerly awaits the 13th World Festival and hopes it will enhance the country's international stature, particularly after the humiliation of watching <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> capital, successfully stage the Summer Olympics last year. `` With the opening day of the festival approaching, our hearts are rushing to its venue,'' <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Dong </PERSON> <PERSON> Yong </PERSON>, head of a train passenger car workshop, wrote in a typically worded article in the official magazine, <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> Today. Colorful posters announcing the coming festival `` for anti-imperialist solidarity, peace and friendship,'' dot the otherwise drab landscape of <LOCATION> Pyongyang </LOCATION>. Tourists who come to the capital are shown the facilities under construction for the event, including the 150,000-seat Rungnado Stadium on an island in the <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Tae </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dong </LOCATION> and a 105-story building said to be the world's tallest hotel. What festival-goers will see when they visit <LOCATION> Pyongyang </LOCATION> is perhaps the world's ultimate Communist capital, unfettered by grand reminders of a non-communist past. While <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> has the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> has the imperial <LOCATION> Forbidden </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, modern <LOCATION> Pyongyang </LOCATION> was built from rubble after the Korean War. Today it is a city of 2 million residents, blocks of tall and uninspired apartments, and six-lane streets uncluttered by vehicles, leaving traffic police plenty of rest as they mechanically direct the occasional bus, truck, East European car or sleek Mercedes. Commuters descend into chandeliered stations to take the subway or patiently line up at bus stops. Pedestrians at major intersections use underpasses beneath the broad streets despite the dearth of traffic. Men in green military overcoats are visible on nearly every street, although some carry briefcases and appear heading to work. One carefully eyed a foreigner who bought a newspaper at a kiosk in the capital while another blocked a tourist from taking a picture of a dirty child at the border town of <LOCATION> Sinuiju </LOCATION>. The streets of <LOCATION> Pyongyang </LOCATION> are deserted at night, with only a dim glow coming from street lamps and apartments. All revolutionary monuments and statues, however, are bathed in lights. Socialist realism is the art style. Prime examples include a heroic statue of a table tennis player and an indoor mural of victorious communist forces, bloodied but not vanquished, smashing the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, which is reviled because it came to the aid of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> in the Korean War and since. A two-hour acrobatic performance viewed by a group of tourists included a skit about the downfall of a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military policeman, who was a caricature with blond hair, crooked nose and slightly hunched back. A North Korean farmer got the best of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> soldier by tricking him into pulling a snake from a straw basket. The snake bit the soldier until he fell unconcious. Placed on the fallen GI's back was the slogan: `` American soldiers go home.''

<HEAD>Officials Say Record Seizures Don't Mean Agents Winning War Against
Drugs</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Law enforcement agencies trumpet their seizure of more than 800 pounds of heroin, calling it the largest drug confiscation ever in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, but officials say that and other similar seizures do n't mean they're winning the war against drugs. Every year, the government set records in the amount of drugs confiscated, but seizures make `` just a dent'' in what's coming into the country or being produced here, says <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Maurice </PERSON> <PERSON> Hill </PERSON>. `` There's more of it now'' than there was three years ago, no matter how much is being seized, says <PERSON> Cornelius </PERSON> <PERSON> Dougherty </PERSON>, another <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman. They say drugs lost to government raids are seen by drug dealers as a mere cost of doing business. `` Historically, a manager of drug couriers gives up one courier who is body carrying -LRB- drugs -RRB- to take your attention away from four more,'' said <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Norsworthy </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> agent at the <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Paso </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. `` People walk away from a brand new aircraft after one load and consider that an expense of the trip,'' he said. `` The same goes for boats, automobiles, campers. They expect to pay a price.'' Law enforcement agencies repeatedly seize millions of dollars in drug profits that go unclaimed because to claim it would mean proving ownership and thus where the money came from, <PERSON> Hill </PERSON> says. A better way to assess how the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is doing in the war on drugs is to concentrate on the price and purity level of the drugs on the street, says Sen. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Biden </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, D-Del. `` For too long, when we've asked whether or not our drug strategy is working, the administration has cited record arrest and seizure data,'' said <PERSON> Biden </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> chairman. A check of price and purity of drugs on the streets, <PERSON> Biden </PERSON> said, shows `` cocaine and heroin on the streets are much cheaper and more potent than they were five years ago.'' In 1982, cocaine sold at the retail level at a range, nationwide, of $ 2,000 to $ 3,000 per ounce and was 50 percent to 60 percent pure, <PERSON> Dougherty </PERSON> said. In 1988, the street price of cocaine had dropped to $ 500 to $ 2,000 per ounce and it was 80 percent pure, said <PERSON> Dougherty </PERSON>, citing information from drug seizures, undercover drug buys, intelligence, and records seized. In 1985, a gram of heroin at 5.3 percent purity could be bought on the street for a minimum of $ 115, he said. By 1988, the cost of a gram at 6 percent to 8 percent purity was as low as $ 90. Drug busts gain a certain public popularity in part because there are very few solid numbers about anything involving the war on drugs, such as the level of illegal drugs in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. `` It's a quagmire,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> Lt. Cmdr. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON> of attempts to calculate the total amount of drugs confiscated. `` If you add them up, you'll find the government got 10 times what it actually seized. ... Everyone's trying to make themselves look good.'' <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON> invented a scenario in which the <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> provides the intelligence, an <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> radar locates the ship, a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> jet spots the ship, the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> tracks it and the final seizure is conducted by a local sheriff in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. `` Even if everyone was trying to do the right thing and no one was trying to cheat, it would still be a nightmare'' to sort out various claims over the seizure, even though the agencies attempt to note when they have assisted and when they have made a seizure alone, he said.

Fifty-five percent of the respondents in the Media General-Associated Press survey supported the use of nuclear power to generate electricity. But eight in 10 favored tougher federal safety regulations, and most opposed building new plants. Most also opposed starting up completed nuclear power plants that are not yet running. And while 48 percent said currently operating plants should stay open, 44 percent said they should be either phased out or shut down at once. The national survey of 1,162 adults had a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percent. It was conducted Jan. 4-12 in advance of the 10th anniversary of the accident March 28, 1979, at the Three Mile Island plant in <LOCATION> Middletown </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa </LOCATION>. Tighter federal regulation of the nuclear power industry resulted from the <ORGANIZATION> TMI </ORGANIZATION> accident, which destroyed one of the plant's two reactors. In the survey, 63 percent said they believed nuclear power plants are safer now. However, when asked to rate the chance of a serious accident at a nuclear power plant in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, 11 percent chose `` highly likely'' and 39 percent said likely, for a total of 50 percent. Thirty percent said a serious accident was unlikely and 14 percent said `` highly unlikely,'' for a total of 44 percent. The remaining 6 percent had no opinion. An overwhelming 79 percent said the federal government should be tougher in enforcing safety rules. And 62 percent said governors should have the power to shut down nuclear power plants in their states. Regulation aside, 56 percent said they believe it is impossible to safely store long-term radioactive waste from nuclear power plants. Just 27 percent called safe storage possible and 18 percent were n't sure. Support for nuclear power was markedly higher among men and Republicans. Two-thirds of those groups supported nuclear power generally, compared with half the <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> and independents and just 45 percent of the women polled. Six in 10 women and as many Democrats said an accident was likely, compared with four in 10 of the men and the Republicans. While 58 percent of the respondents with high school educations feared an accident, that fell to 37 percent of those with postgraduate schooling. Only a third overall said more nuclear power plants should be built in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>; of those who favored more plants, three-quarters said they would accept one within 10 miles of their home. No new nuclear power plant construction permits have been issued since 1979. Just two in 10 said nuclear power plants that have been completed but not yet licensed should be allowed to open. Such plants in <LOCATION> Seabrook </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.H. </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Shoreham </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, have been stalled in part by opposition from the governor in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and, in <PERSON> Seabrook </PERSON>'s case, the governor of neighboring <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>. Six in 10 said governors should have the authority to prevent a nuclear plant from opening in their states, and as many said governors should be able to shut down operating plants. Governors do not have such power now. Forty-eight percent said the nation's 108 fully operating commercial nuclear power plants should continue to operate, 35 percent said they should be phased out gradually, 9 percent said they should be closed immediately and 8 percent had no opinion. Of those who wanted the plants phased out, a third wanted it done within five years, about a third within 10 years and the rest would allow longer. <ORGANIZATION> Media </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a communications company based in <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, publishes the Richmond Times-Dispatch, the Richmond News Leader, the <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION> -LRB- <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION> -RRB- <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION> and the <LOCATION> Winston-Salem </LOCATION> -LRB- <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION> -RRB- Journal, and operates TV stations <ORGANIZATION> WXFL </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION>, WCBD in <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> WJKS </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Jacksonville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla </LOCATION>.

 This <ORGANIZATION> Media </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General-Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> poll is based on telephone interviews Jan. 4-12 with 1,162 adults in the continental <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Phone numbers were selected randomly and interviews were conducted with the adult in the household called who had the most recent birthday, a random phenomenon. The results were weighted to adjust for variations in the sample. The poll has a margin of error of plus or minus 3 points, meaning that if every adult American were asked the same questions, the results theoretically would be within three points of the poll's results, 19 times out of 20 The error margin is larger for subgroups _ four points, for example, for men. There are other sources of potential error in polls, including the wording and order of questions. These are the questions in this poll; because of rounding, sums may not total 100: 1.

 <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, 19, sat in the fading heat of an 86-degree <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> day when a car full of menacing young men cruised down Van Ness Avenue at 7:30 p.m. Shotgun blasts exploded from the car, and <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> fell dead in a crime known as a drive-by shooting. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> was not known to be a member of a gang. He may have just been in the way of shots aimed at someone else, police said, or he may have been wearing the colors of a rival outfit. `` A wrong look or wearing the wrong color in a certain neighborhood can get you killed,'' said <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Sheriff's Capt <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Gott </PERSON>. Of the 55 slayings in <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>' neighborhood this year, 15 are believed related to gangs wiping out competitors and protecting their turf. At least four gangs grossed $ 1 million a week each last year in cocaine sales, according to Police Commander <PERSON> Lorne </PERSON> <PERSON> Kramer </PERSON>. `` These urban terrorists are destroying hopes for a normal life,'' said <PERSON> Kramer </PERSON>.

 Similar battles are played out daily in every major <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> city where police fight drugs and crime, which often go hand in hand. On a given day, an average of 2,568 arrests are made for possessing, selling and making drugs, according to the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>. Half to three-fourths of the people arrested for serious crimes tested positive for illicit drug use, according to a 1988 <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> study. Drugs can lead to murder, assault, prostitution, theft, robbery and burglary. `` Crime and drugs are umbilically connected,'' said <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Bensinger </PERSON>, former director of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> and now a drug consultant in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. `` The impact is devastating our cities and our streets.''

 <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> fights the street-by-street war with a Tactical Narcotics Team, or TNT, a sort of special forces unit whose uniforms are filthy jeans and shabby sweat shirts rather than green berets. Steady rain did n't stop them from donning bulletproof vests and earphones connected to hidden walkie-talkies. `` A junkie does n't know rain, a junkie does n't know sleet or cold, a junkie just wants to get off,'' said Lt. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON>. Among the busts this day, an undercover officer got past a lookout and into a drug den, the basement of an abandoned building that reeked of urine and rotting garbage in the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bronx </LOCATION>. The officer bought heroin, and others waiting in an unmarked car moved in for the bust. Three arrests netted a fistful of heroin packets worth $ 100. A search of the dealer's office showed 170 of 400 heroin packets were sold before the raid. In one week, police arrested 125 people and seized 16 cars, two guns, $ 8,633 in cash and a cache of cocaine, crack, heroin and pot.

 With the temperature at 36 degrees, a 20-mph wind whipped through southeast <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, a tough neighborhood known by the cops as `` The Zoo.'' `` They should put a cage around the whole zone,'' said patrolman <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>. The cold slowed the drug trade to about one-third its usual pace. But <PERSON> Ricky </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> was arrested for alleged possession after a chase. Police found a leather pouch containing nine plastic bags, each holding a pea-sized fragment of crack cocaine. At one point, a reporter was advised to duck behind a trash bin if gunfire erupted.

 In <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, an undercover narcotics team made 14 arrests in assembly line fashion. One was a 16-year-old selling crack outside his apartment. Across the city that day, about 200 of an estimated 1,000 armed robberies, auto thefts and burglaries were believed to have been drug-related, said police spokesman <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Lang </PERSON>.

 In <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>, six men were face down on the floor of an abandoned, smoke-filled apartment while a few officers stood over them with guns drawn. `` This is a day-in, day-out battle,'' said Lt. <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Richie </PERSON>, who heads the evening crew at <ORGANIZATION> Dallas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s central division. If a crack addict has a $ 20,000-a-year habit, he must steal about $ 200,000 worth of goods to support it, according to Capt. E.R. <PERSON> Walt </PERSON> of the Narcotics Division. `` Most crack addicts do n't work and could n't afford it if they did,'' <PERSON> Walt </PERSON> said. `` So there's a lot of stuff stolen.''

 A 17-year-old <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> man was busted on his birthday Wednesday when police seized $ 1,500 in cash and $ 4,700 in drugs. Police saw him selling drugs the day before but could n't find his stash. `` Yeah, man, I'll be 17,'' he taunted officers. `` So they paid a visit to his house on his birthday,'' said Sgt. <PERSON> Leman </PERSON> <PERSON> Dobbins </PERSON>. `` If he's going to play in the grown folks' world, we're going to treat him like one.'' Police said six of the 14 crimes reported Wednesday were drug-related. `` We've run across some dope dealers -LRB- with -RRB- a <ORGANIZATION> Mercedes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Benz </ORGANIZATION> that's paid for in cash. But when you got to arrest him, he does n't even know how to spell his middle name,'' <PERSON> Dobbins </PERSON> said `` Whoever said crime does not pay is a fool.''

 The 52 drug arrests in <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION> on Wednesday included a federal fugitive wanted for allegedly helping a notorious drug kingpin arrange a multimillion-dollar heroin deal from his jail cell. Three other arrests followed a raid that netted $ 500,000 worth of cocaine and heroin. <PERSON> Roland </PERSON> <PERSON> Hines </PERSON>, 26, of <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION> was arrested at 8 p.m. He was one of five people indicted by a federal grand jury in November on charges of conspiring in the sale of 5 kilograms, or 11 pounds, of heroin to an informant in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>.

 In <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>, 24 of 75 arrests Wednesday were drug-related, police said.

<HEAD>Top Industrialist Says Country `Stinks' Because of Apartheid</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID CRARY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 One of the country's leading industrialists said Monday that apartheid `` has made <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> stink'' and urged the government to draft a long-term plan for reform. <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Oppenheimer </PERSON>, 80-year-old former chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Anglo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>, mining conglomerate, said in a speech the government must abandon its cautious, piecemeal approach to reform and stop trying to appease right-wing whites. He said foreign countries would respond favorably to `` a bold commitment to consistent, long-range reform.'' `` Disagreeable though it may be, we must admit that the racial policy which has been pursued here over the last 40 years has made <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> stink in the nostrils of decent, humane people around the world,'' he said. <PERSON> Oppenheimer </PERSON> said <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s disenfranchised black majority will reject the free enterprise system `` unless they are enabled to share to the full in the great benefits it can bring. That is certainly not the case today.'' `` The immediate need therefore is to open the economy in a fair and equal way to all <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africans </LOCATION>,'' he said. `` That calls, amongst other things, for the repeal of the Group Areas Act,'' which mandates racial segregation of residential areas. In other developments Monday: _ Lawyers and civil rights workers said about 80 detainees have been released in the 10 days since Law and Order Minister <PERSON> Adriaan </PERSON> <PERSON> Vlok </PERSON> held negotiations to resolve a widespread hunger strike. <PERSON> Vlok </PERSON> told anti-apartheid clergymen that a `` substantial number'' of the estimated 1,000 detainees held without charge would be freed within two weeks. Four hunger strikers who had been admitted to <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> were released Monday, but they told reporters they had been placed under restrictions barring them from political activity and requiring them to be in their homes at night. Most of the more than 300 hunger strikers suspended their fast pending an assessment of the government's response. But lawyers say some detainees in <ORGANIZATION> Natal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Province </ORGANIZATION> are continuing the strike, demanding to be freed or charged. _ Blacks living around the mining town of <LOCATION> Carletonville </LOCATION> began a boycott of white-owned shops to protest a resegregation campaign by the town council. Councilors of the extreme-right <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, which took power in a local election in October, have reinstated `` whites-only'' status at local parks and plan to build a fence to keep blacks off the town hall's lawn. White businessmen in <LOCATION> Carletonville </LOCATION>, worried about the effects of a boycott, met Monday to discuss ways of reversing the council's action <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> officials said they will not bow to pressure. _ In <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> members moved to condemn the government for creating `` a continued state of lawlessness'' by failing to evict non-whites living illegally in inner-city areas that officially are `` whites only.''

<TEXT>
 Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> billed Tuesday's nationwide municipal elections as a referendum on the <LOCATION> Arab-Israeli </LOCATION> conflict, saying gains for his right-wing <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> bloc would show the world <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> will never talk to the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> `` Every vote for <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> means that <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> wants no truck with the murderers of our sons who want to destroy <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> was quoted as saying Monday by the <ORGANIZATION> Jerusalem </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>. But leaders of the left-leaning <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> rejected <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s claim, saying local, not national, issues are at stake, and that the personalities of the candidates take precedent over ideology `` It's completely off the subject. We will focus on the issues that count, day-to-day municipal issues,'' said <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Eldar </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION>'s campaign manager. Two issues that played a role in the November general elections probably will spill over into the municipal voting: the religious-secular conflict and the nearly 15-month-old Palestinian uprising against <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> occupation of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Pro-Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> underground leaders of the uprising have urged the about 70,000 Arab voters in east <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> to boycott the elections, and called a general strike for Tuesday to enforce the order. At the same time, the army ordered the occupied lands sealed from midnight Monday to 10 p.m. Tuesday, barring <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> residents from entering <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. Political analysts, meanwhile, predicted gains for the religious parties similar to those in the November elections. In that vote, relivious parties increased their representation from 14 to 18 seats in the 120-member <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, alarming many secular Israelis. About 2.7 million Israelis, of them 400,000 Arabs, are eligible to vote in 147 municipalities, choosing mayors and 1,341 council members. There are 99 municipalities in the Jewish sector, and 48 in the Arab sector. In the 1983 elections, 55 percent of the voters cast ballots, and election officials expect a similar turnout this year. In the last general elections, turnout was nearly 80 percent. In 1983, <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> won in 54 municipalities, compared with 26 towns ruled by <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION>. The remainder of the towns are run by local political groups or religious parties. Each voter casts two ballots, one for mayor and one for a party slate. Parties are awarded seats in the City Council according to the number of votes won. Key contests are in the three largest cities: <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Haifa </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, Mayor <PERSON> Teddy </PERSON> <PERSON> Kollek </PERSON> is assured re-election to a sixth term, but his Labor-affiliated `` One <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>'' list might lose control of the 31-member <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> because of the Arab boycott and the growing strength of the religious parties. Working with a hostile council might force <PERSON> Kollek </PERSON> to make concessions to right-wing and religious parties, thus further escalating the <LOCATION> Arab-Israeli </LOCATION> and religious-secular conflicts dividing the city. In <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION>, the only major city run by <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION>, popular Mayor <PERSON> Shlomo </PERSON> <PERSON> Lahat </PERSON> is likely to win a fourth term. <PERSON> Lahat </PERSON> says he has turned <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION> into an international metropolis and promised secular voters to keep the city free from religious coercion. The religious parties insist on closing entertainment spots, including restaurants and movie theaters, on the <PERSON> Jewish </PERSON> <PERSON> Sabbath </PERSON>, the biblically mandated day of rest that lasts from sundown Friday to sundown Saturday. <LOCATION> Haifa </LOCATION>, a stronghold of the left for decades, has become a major battleground for the two big parties. `` We have red flags all over the country, and we would like to paint some of them blue -LRB- the color of <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> -RRB-,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION>'s campaign organizer, <PERSON> Nimrod </PERSON> <PERSON> Granit </PERSON> `` Taking <LOCATION> Haifa </LOCATION> would be like taking <LOCATION> Stalingrad </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Granit </PERSON> said, referring to the Soviet city in which the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> successfully withstood a German offensive during World War II.

<DATELINE>KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Prime Minister <PERSON> Sadek </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahdi </PERSON> said Monday he will resign in a week unless the army promises not to overthrow him and leaders of trade and professional unions pledge not to strike. Price riots and general strikes nearly four years ago prompted the army to oust President <PERSON> Gaafar </PERSON> <PERSON> Nimeiri </PERSON>, who had ruled <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION> for 16 years. <PERSON> Mahdi </PERSON>'s civilian government was elected a year later. <PERSON> Mahdi </PERSON>'s comments were made in a speech to <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> on Monday _ the deadline the military gave him a week ago for choosing a new Cabinet and trying to end the 6-year-old civil war in southern <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION>. Army officials did not say what they would do if <PERSON> Mahdi </PERSON> did not meet their conditions and had no immediate reaction to his speech, but sources in the military said privately the high command was assessing it. On their clandestine radio station, the rebels claimed to have captured <LOCATION> Torit </LOCATION>, a strategic garrison town in <LOCATION> Equatoria </LOCATION> province that had been under siege for months. <PERSON> Mahdi </PERSON> told Parliament the army ultimatum did not threaten a coup, then demanded assurances there would not be one. After the ultimatum was issued Feb. 20, a military spokesman said he would not describe it as a coup threat. The army made its demands after <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Minister <PERSON> Abdel-Meguid </PERSON> <PERSON> Khalil </PERSON> resigned. <PERSON> Khalil </PERSON> quit in protest of the government's refusal to endorse a peace agreement proposed in November by the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Unionist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, which was part of the government coalition at the time, and the rebel <ORGANIZATION> Sudan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>. After <PERSON> Mahdi </PERSON> refused to submit the plan to the Cabinet or <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, the Unionists left the government. Four gunmen opened fire Monday on the house of <PERSON> Syd </PERSON> <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Mirghani </PERSON>, whose brother, <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Osman </PERSON>, is the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Unionist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leader, and fled when guards returned the fire. No injuries were reported. <PERSON> Syd </PERSON> <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Mirghani </PERSON> heads the <ORGANIZATION> Sudanese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION>, a collective presidency, and is a member of <LOCATION> Khatmiya </LOCATION>, one of <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION>'s two principal Moslem sects <PERSON> Mahdi </PERSON> leads the other sect, <PERSON> Ansar </PERSON>. Three people were arrested later Monday and the van was found, the official <ORGANIZATION> Sudan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> reported. A similar attack was made on <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Osman </PERSON> <PERSON> Mirghani </PERSON>'s home in November, also with no injuries. <PERSON> Mahdi </PERSON> said Monday he would `` make efforts'' to form a broad-based government to create political unity and end the war. Rebels led by <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Garang </PERSON>, a former army colonel, seek more economic advantages for the south, most of whose people are black Christians or animists, and autonomy from the the overwhelmingly Arab and Moslem north. In its broadcast, the rebel radio said <LOCATION> Torit </LOCATION>, 750 miles south of <LOCATION> Khartoum </LOCATION>, was captured on Sunday. It said two senior army officers, a brigadier and a colonel, and the provincial commissioner were taken prisoner. There was no confirmation from the government.

<HEAD>U.S. Says Soviets Sent $515 Million in Weapons to Sandinistas in
1988</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE GEDDA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> exported about $ 515 million worth of military equipment to <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> last year, the second highest total since the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> began weapons deliveries in 1980, according to a new <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government report. The report says last year's delivery of 19,000 tons of equipment came during 68 ship visits to Nicaraguan ports, an average of about one every six days. The unclassified analysis, compiled by intelligence agencies, said the peak year for Soviet arms shipments was 1986 when the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> received $ 550 million worth of equipment. That was the last year <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> approved military aid for the Nicaraguan Contras. A year ago, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> suspended military aid to the Contras, and as the months passed, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration officials expressed deep disappointment that the Soviets did not reciprocate by cutting back on weapons shipments to the <LOCATION> Sandinistas </LOCATION>. The aid suspension was quickly followed by an interim cease-fire between the Sandinistas and the Contras in late March. Subsequently, about 11,000 Contras fled to camps in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> along the border where the rebels are sustained by a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> humanitarian aid program. The Sandinistas have contended that continued Soviet arms shipments were needed in the event the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> decided to resume military aid to the Contras. The <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> has said that it would suspend arms deliveries to the Sandinistas as part of an overall ban on outside arms shipments to <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, but the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has shown no interest in that proposal. The $ 515 million listed for 1988 is described in the report as a preliminary estimate which is subject to revision as new data become available. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials have estimated Soviet economic aid to <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> at about $ 500 million annually. A <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official, who asked not to be identified, said estimates of military aid were somewhat easier to make last year because a lack of storage space forced the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> to leave much of the equipment out in the open where it could be photographed by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> intelligence agencies. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> have shown an ability to work together on several regional conflicts, including <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Angola-Namibia </PERSON> and the Iran-Iraq war. But the superpowers remain deeply divided over <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> looks on the continuing Soviet arms deliveries as the most troubling aspect of Soviet involvement in that area. Former Assistant Secretary of State <PERSON> Elliott </PERSON> <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> said last month before leaving office that economic decline in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> has left the Sandinista government somewhat weaker but that the weapons deliveries have made it stronger militarily. The report said that the Sandinista army, including `` active duty and mobilized militia-reserves,'' totaled 80,000 at the start of 1989, the same figure as a year earlier. The Sandinista inventory also included 150 tanks, 250 other armored vehicles, 32 fixed-wing aircraft, 50 helicopters and six airfields, the report said. The type of equipment received by the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> in 1988 was not specified in the report.

 For a time Monday the most pressing question for some of the highest officials of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government was: Which ones are my shoes? The top poohbahs of the <ORGANIZATION> Bush </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> had to leave their shoes at the door when they lunched in the pleasant wooden surroundings of the Ever Spring House on the grounds of the <ORGANIZATION> Blue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, the fortified residence of Korean presidents. That's Korean tradition. No problem. But when lunch was over there they were, in a neat row, the nine pairs of nearly identical black slip-on shoes that clearly are favored by the upper crust of the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> team. Which were Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>'s and which were Chief of Staff <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON>'s? Which belonged to <PERSON> Brent </PERSON> <PERSON> Scowcroft </PERSON>, the temporarily shoeless national security adviser, and which to <PERSON> Gaston </PERSON> <PERSON> Sigur </PERSON>, the assistant secretary of state? With all the dignity they could command, they stood on the porch of the Ever Spring House, long-handled shoehorns in hand, figuring out which shoes belonged to which feet. They did it, and were shod in time for the formal ceremony ending <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s talk and lunch with President <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> <PERSON> Tae-Woo </PERSON>, the former four-star general who is <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s Korean counterpart. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had no problem with his shoes. The presidential shoes were the only ones of the American party that were laced, traditional black wingtips. It did n't even matter, hoever, since a Korean aide whisked <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s shoes inside at the last minute, sparing the president the need to put them on in public If shoes were a problem, so were legs, at lunch. The Ever Spring House is a handsome Korean building of 52 red pine pillars, and the meal served inside was equally traditional, including the sitting arrangements. Sitting was on seats that lack legs. The president, who stands 6-feet-2, did not know quite where to put his feet that lacked shoes. So he asked his host, <PERSON> Roh </PERSON>, `` Do you put your legs straight out or do you fold them up?'' The president of <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> showed the president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> how to fit his long legs under the low table. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was in <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> for a friendship stop on the way home from his trip to the funeral of Emperor <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and his visit to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. He talked and lunched with <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> _ pumpkin porridge, three kinds of fish, sliced marinated beef, dumpling soup, rice cakes and milky-white Korean rice wine. But mostly he posed for pictures duing his Korean visit of less than five hours. He posed at the airport, where Koreans waving paper flags held up signs reading: `` Great Regard for <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>.'' He posed with <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> upon arriving at the <ORGANIZATION> Blue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, and with <PERSON> Roh </PERSON>'s wife, and when he signed the guest book He posed during the talks, photographers being allowed in in relays, assembly line fashion. He posed before lunch in the Ever Spring House, with his shoes off. -LRB- The photographers were equally unshod. -RRB- He posed after lunch with <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> after both declared their talks a great success in remarks written before the session started. At the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> posed with the assembly speaker and the speaker's wife. Just a few more pictures at the airport with members of the American community and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was ready to head home. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> went by helicopter everywhere he traveled in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>. Parts of the city, including near the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> and the university, saw ugly police-demonstrator clashes, but the airborne <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> never laid eyes on an angry Korean.

 The governors of <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> agreed Monday to share the cost of a low-level nuclear waste site, said Gov. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Blanchard </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>. In January, <PERSON> Blanchard </PERSON> had halted site selection in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> until the other states in the <ORGANIZATION> Midwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Interstate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Low-Level </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radioactive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Waste </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Compact </ORGANIZATION> met demands designed to ensure <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> bore only its fair share of the financial burden. He ordered the site-selection process to resume after the states agreed to his terms. `` No one wants to be left holding the bag with the low-level waste issue,'' <PERSON> Blanchard </PERSON> said in announcing the agreement. <PERSON> Blanchard </PERSON> and the governors of <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> reached agreement on the waste site Monday after two days of conferences during the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Governors </ORGANIZATION>' Association winter meeting `` We support the party states sharing reponsibility and liability for those expenses not paid for by insurance or the funds established in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> statute, and that share be based on a prorated amount according to the amount of waste generated in each state,'' the governors said in a joint letter to <PERSON> Blanchard </PERSON>. The governors also agreed that each state would continue to pay its share of the disposal site's operation even if the state withdraws from the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> compact. The disposal plant would cost an estimated $ 300 million over its 20-year life, said <PERSON> J.D </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Snyder </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Blanchard </PERSON>'s aide dealing with environmental issues. With the agrement, <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>'s share could be less than one-third of that amount, <PERSON> Snyder </PERSON> said. Had the other states failed to agree to <PERSON> Blanchard </PERSON>'s terms, <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> would have had to pay the full cost of building and operating the plant. The state legislatures would need to approve spending on the site, <PERSON> Blanchard </PERSON> said, adding he foresaw no difficulty in obtaining the funding. <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> was selected as the site for the nuclear waste dump because it generates the most radioactive waste in the region. <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> generated about 27,000 cubic feet of low-level radioactive waste last year from nuclear plants, research institutions and hospitals. <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>'s nuclear waste now goes to sites in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, whose governors threatened to refuse to accept <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> waste unless <PERSON> Blanchard </PERSON> rescinded his order halting site selection.

<HEAD>U.S. Ambassador Says Swedish Texts Misrepresent America</HEAD>
<DATELINE>STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Swedish students are getting a distorted view of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in their schoolbooks, <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON> <PERSON> Newell </PERSON> said Monday. <PERSON> Newell </PERSON>, who is leaving <LOCATION> Stockholm </LOCATION> in June after three years as ambassador, said the American view of <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION> as a permissive and socialistic country also was inaccurate, and the two countries should get to know each other better. <PERSON> Newell </PERSON>'s complaint was based on a study of about 50 history books and other texts for the Swedish equivalent of high school and junior high. The results of the review were reported to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials said. Many of the books were outdated and written in a period when <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION> was outspokenly critical of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> involvement in the Vietnam War. In one book, the few sentences about <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> included the fact that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> planes dropped more bombs there than fell in World War II, said an embassy official who spoke on condition he was not identified. Newer books also gave too much stress to racial problems, poverty and homelessness, the official said. <PERSON> Newell </PERSON>, speaking on Swedish Radio, cited a series of texts he saw three years ago titled `` <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>.'' `` The picture and the facts were accurate but they were n't full. They talked about poverty levels, they talked about compassion lacking and the underprivileged of <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' he said. They made no mention of the creation of new jobs and the reduction of inflation, he said. `` Those sorts of things we do n't see treated in a balanced way That is our concern,'' <PERSON> Newell </PERSON> added.

 Soviet overtures to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> will be on the agenda when Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> meets next week in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> with Soviet Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> also will hold separate talks with the foreign ministers of the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> and participate in ceremonies marking the opening of new East-West arms control negotiations, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> announced Monday. The negotiations concern concentrations of <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact ground forces and tanks in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. The goal is to reduce them as a means of easing East-West tensions. Spokesman <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> would leave <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> for the Austrian capital on Saturday and return on March 7. The negotiations will open March 9 under a broad agreement between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> reached last year to supersede 15 years of futile discussions. The talks that failed dealt with Central <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. The new negotiations will cover the vast expanse of the continent _ from the <LOCATION> Ural </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountains </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> to the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>'s meeting with <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> was described by <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> as a `` get-acquainted'' session. The Soviet foreign minister has just completed a trip to the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> in which he offered a resumption of relations to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> if it would negotiate with the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, and has been to <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> spoke to the <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>, the spiritual leader of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, who proposed closer ties to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> to counter what the fundamentalist cleric called `` devilish acts of the West.'' <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> confirmed the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> were on <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>'s agenda for the <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> meeting. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration is in the midst of reviewing <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy toward the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said last week he foresaw only a limited role for the Soviets in the region and that he would not be `` stampeded'' into taking decisions as a result of the Soviet initiative. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> is due to report to the <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> foreign ministers, meanwhile, on how he views prospects for <LOCATION> Arab-Israeli </LOCATION> diplomacy. Several of them urged him during a trip to <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> earlier this month to take advantage of what they considered to be Palestinian moderation. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> remarked at the time that `` one has to till the ground carefully; one has to proceed cautiously and understand that if you push the level of discussion too high, too soon, and create too much international attention you might pre-empt opportunities.''

<TEXT>
 Former Mayor <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Boyle </PERSON>, ousted in a 1987 recall election, announced today that he will run again for the city's top job. In announcing his candidacy, <PERSON> Boyle </PERSON> said he decided to run because he loves politics and public service and because a surprisingly large number of people urged him to enter the race. `` I believe I have learned much from the mistakes that I made when I was mayor, that I have grown from those experiences and that I could provide seasoned and thoughtful leadership for the people of <LOCATION> Omaha </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Boyle </PERSON> said. Among <PERSON> Boyle </PERSON>'s opponents in the non-partisan primary is city Councilman <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Cleary </PERSON>, who gained prominence as leader of the <PERSON> Boyle </PERSON> recall movement in 1987 and later was elected to the city council. The primary is set for April 4, the general election for May 9. <PERSON> Boyle </PERSON>, 45, was elected mayor in 1981 and re-elected in 1985. But opponents began gathering petition signatures shortly after his second term started. They accused <PERSON> Boyle </PERSON> of abusing his power, meddling in police affairs, being soft on drunken driving and being disrespectful, citing an incident in which he allegedly threw pats of butter during a dinner-table argument. On Jan. 13, 1987, <PERSON> Boyle </PERSON> became the first mayor in <LOCATION> Omaha </LOCATION>'s history to be recalled with 56 percent of voters supporting the recall and 44 percent in favor or retaining <PERSON> Boyle </PERSON>. <PERSON> Boyle </PERSON> returned to a private law practice after the recall. Both <PERSON> Boyle </PERSON> and <PERSON> Cleary </PERSON> said the recall will not be an issue in the mayoral race. `` It's been over two years. I do n't think people want the recall revisited,'' <PERSON> Boyle </PERSON> said Sunday, before officially announcing his candidacy. Also in the mayoral race are Mayor <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Calinger </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Conley </PERSON>, former <LOCATION> Douglas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Commissioner <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> McCollister </PERSON> and real estate manager <PERSON> P.J </PERSON>. <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON>.

<TEXT>
 It's a likely combination for a book of memoirs. The editor, one of the most powerful in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> publishing, also writes potboilers and has Hollywood connections. The author, former President <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, is a powerbroker with a `` B'' movie past. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Korda </PERSON>, son of film art director <PERSON> Vincent </PERSON> <PERSON> Korda </PERSON>, certainly knows about power. He is editor-in-chief at <ORGANIZATION> Simon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Schuster, has written best-selling tomes including `` Queenie'' and the how-to `` Power!'' and has been editor for presidents and novelists. As <PERSON> Korda </PERSON>, 55, prepares to work on <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s memoirs, his own easy-to-digest novel `` The Fortune,'' about the shenanigans of a powerful and rich family, is appearing in bookstores. `` It can be argued I like to write about subjects that are flashy and glamorous. ... So does <PERSON> Jackie </PERSON> <PERSON> Collins </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Korda </PERSON> said during a recent stop here on a promotional tour. `` I guess I'm interested in the penalties that come with having too much,'' says <PERSON> Korda </PERSON>. <PERSON> Korda </PERSON> has worked with a varied group of authors that includes <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> <PERSON> Greene </PERSON>, <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Robbins </PERSON>, <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Burgess </PERSON>, <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Koch </PERSON>, <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> DeGaulle </PERSON>, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>, <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Kissinger </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> and the <PERSON> Collins </PERSON> sisters, <PERSON> Jackie </PERSON> and <PERSON> Joan </PERSON>. He has always moved easily in conservative circles although he is a Democrat. `` I'm a Kennedy Democrat _ an old <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, not the new one,'' he said, distinguishing between the late president and his brother, Sen. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>. It's too early to talk about what the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> book will be like, <PERSON> Korda </PERSON> said. No publication date has been set. `` I ca n't tell you what's going to be in the book.'' he said. `` But there are millions and millions of Americans who voted for him twice, who regard him as a great American hero. Forget whether you agree with him or not.'' <PERSON> Korda </PERSON> said he knows little of <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s writing plans, even whether the book will be composed on legal pad or computer terminal. He quotes <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s public statement that he wo n't employ a ghostwriter. <PERSON> Korda </PERSON> refuses to disclose the size of the deal with <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, saying that's the author's prerogative. Before the contract was announced Jan. 25, a literary agent guessed the book would bring more than $ 5 million. However <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> delivers his version of his life, <PERSON> Korda </PERSON> says any book by the best-selling president is sure to be a best-seller, too. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> is no stranger to <ORGANIZATION> Simon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Schuster. The publisher wanted a book by <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> even before he ran for governor of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Korda </PERSON> said. The subject then was to be <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s account of his time heading the Screen Actor's Guild during the 1950s era of McCarthyism. <PERSON> Korda </PERSON>'s editing technique is discreet and sideways. He wo n't tell the memoirist what to include, but he might nudge a little. Then there are <PERSON> Korda </PERSON>'s own ventures as an author, the novel `` Queenie'' based on the life of his actress aunt, the late <PERSON> Merle </PERSON> <PERSON> Oberon </PERSON>, and a memoir, `` Charmed Lives.'' He's also written how-tos, including `` Male Chauvinism! How It Works'' and `` Power! How to Get It, How to Use It.'' Those books responded to a time when people were most interested in taking and using power, he said. They preceded the excesses of the <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> administration, larger numbers of women in the workforce and the polarized wealth that resulted in more millionaires and more have-nots, he said. `` Today people are much more interested in money, domestic life, in happiness, in having a fulfilled and complete life,'' <PERSON> Korda </PERSON> said. Thus, his new book, `` The Fortune,'' concerns a family of billionaires fighting over sex and money. `` For eight years we've had relative prosperity, at least for middle-class white people. ... You've got a country on the whole that's not interested in civil rights. Even <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> does n't refer to the civil rights movement anymore We've written off the poor as a matter of interest.''

<HEAD>Business Economists See Recession by End of Next Year</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Economics Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The economy will slow substantially in 1989 with rising inflation and higher interest rates likely to topple the country into a recession before the end of next year, the nation's top business economists predicted Monday The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economists </ORGANIZATION> said a survey of its members found them slightly more optimistic about growth prospects for this year than they were three months ago. But by lopsided numbers, the economists were still predicting that the most likely date for the start of the next recession was 1990. Three out of four of the economists surveyed expected a new recession sometime in the next two years. However, the number predicting a downturn in 1989 dropped from 40 percent to 19 percent in the latest survey. <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Woodworth </PERSON>, president of the association, said that economists were more optimistic about 1989 in part because of signs that auto sales, retail spending and housing construction were holding up even with the increase in interest rates. `` The business economists feel that this expansion is not at the end of its string yet. We probably have another year or so to go,'' <PERSON> Woodworth </PERSON>, senior domestic economist at <ORGANIZATION> Bankers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, said at a news briefing. The new survey was taken before the latest round of credit-tightening on the part of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>. Last Friday, the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> boosted its discount rate, the interest it charges to make loans to financial institions, to 7 percent. A hike in the discount rate is the most dramatic signal the central bank can send of its intentions to push interest rates higher to dampen an overheated economy. The business economists expressed strong support for the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>'s inflation-fighting battle, with 70 percent expecting the board to boost interest rates further in the next six months <PERSON> Woodward </PERSON> said the inflationary pressures, if they do not start receding, would likely take their toll on the expansion, which has already lasted a peacetime record of six years. `` Inflation rates of 5 percent to 5.25 percent are too high to be consistent with long-term growth and over time they would send the economy into a recession,'' he said. The median forecast for growth this year, as measured by the gross national product, was 2.7 percent, up slightly from a 2.5 percent estimate made by the business economists three months ago. The economy grew at a four-year high of 3.8 percent last year. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration has based its first budget on an estimate that the economy will slow only modestly in 1989 to a growth rate of 3.2 percent, but this estimate is about one-half percentage point higher than most private forecasters. The administration is counting on faster growth to bring in more revenues and help it lower the budget deficit without resorting to higher taxes. On the question of interest rates, the business economists see short-term rates hitting a peak of 8.5 percent this year and then beginning to decline to 7.8 percent by the end of 1989. The administration is forecasting substantially lower rates for this year, a projection that also makes the deficit look smaller on paper because it lowers government borrowing costs. On other topics, the business economists said: _ Unemployment will show little change this year because of the generally sluggish outlook for growth The jobless rate should average 5.5 percent for the whole year, up slightly from the 5.4 percent unemployment rate recorded in January. _ Inflation will worsen this year with consumer prices climbing by 4.8 percent, compared to increases of 4.4 percent in both 1987 and 1988 _ The merchandise trade deficit, whicllion last year, will continue improving but at a slower rate in 1989, falling by 12 percent to $ 120 billion The business economists generally supported <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s stand that the budget deficit should be reduced primarily by cutting government spending. Only 15 percent of those surveyed said they believed tax increases should be emphasized over spending cuts although a larger group said they would be willing to accept a package of tax increases and spending cuts. A large majority of economists, 72 percent, singled out reductions in farm subsidies as the most fruitful place to look for savings, followed by cuts in military spending, favored by 55 percent, and reductions in cost-of-living increases fosupported by 47 percent of those surveyed. On the tax side, 71 percent of economists said they would favor an increase in the gasoline tax followed by 51 percent who said government user fees should be raised. The economic projections were based on a survey of 69 economists who make up the association's economic forecasting panel. The assessments of budgetary and monetary policy came from a broader survey of nearly 300 of the association's members.

 Organizers hope an exhibition opening Wednesday of 26 centuries of Chinese art will propel this central <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> city into the cultural major leagues. `` It's a major statement, showing that <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION> can back its cultural exhibitions,'' said <PERSON> Dorothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Brownley </PERSON>, who helped raise more than $ 3.3 million for the exhibit titled `` Son of Heaven: Imperial Arts of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>.'' The display of 225 pieces of Chinese art and artifacts dating to the 4th century B.C. runs through Sept. 4. Some say the fanfare surrounding the show could generate support for other, large-scale art exhibitions. `` This city is entering into a larger arena for the arts,'' said <PERSON> Merribell </PERSON> <PERSON> Parsons </PERSON>, the exhibit's director and head of the <ORGANIZATION> Columbus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Museum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Art </ORGANIZATION>. The show features objects from the palaces of 2,600 years of Chinese emperors and kings. They were lent mostly by museums in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> and eight Chinese provinces. Included are life-sized terra-cotta horses and warrior sculptures from the tomb of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s first emperor; 2,500-year-old cooking vessels and temple bells; delicate scroll paintings from the 15th century; and a 2nd-century jade burial suit. Some of the items were found in recent archeological digs in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, Ms. <PERSON> Parsons </PERSON> said. `` Son of Heaven'' was <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s term for its emperors, believed to be the human link to Heaven. `` It's a very, very important record of Chinese cultural history and its art,'' <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> art professor <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Thorp </PERSON> said recently. <PERSON> Thorp </PERSON> helped lead the collaboration of the Chinese government and a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> organizing committee that created the exhibit. The importance of `` Son of Heaven'' has n't been lost on <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION>. More than a week before the opening, about 85,000 tickets had been sold at $ 4.50 to $ 12.50, said exhibit spokeswoman <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Cramer </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION> schoolchildren were learning ancient <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> history to prepare for field trips, and <ORGANIZATION> Ohio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> added a series of `` Son of Heaven'' lectures to its continuing education curriculum. A downtown department store since last fall has devoted a section of its first floor to `` Son of Heaven'' sweatshirts, T-shirts and mugs. An empty downtown school was loaned by the city and converted for the show into a five-gallery, 40,000-square-foot exhibition hall. It even contains a cafeteria for visitors and a hospitality suite for donors. Not that the arts generally go ignored in <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION>, a city of slightly more than half a million that supports a professional orchestra, ballet company, opera company and theater troupe. But this exhibition has been compared to the `` Treasures of Tutankhamun,'' the ancient Egyptian collection that drew millions of vistors during a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> tour that included <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> more than a decade ago. The success of `` Tut'' may have helped generate support for later, major exhibits in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, including a display of Pompeiian art at the <ORGANIZATION> Art </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> and another Egyptian show that opened at the Field Museum of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> last November, said that museum's Egyptian consultant, <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Yurco </PERSON> The Field Museum sold 47,000 new memberships during `` Tut's'' four-month stay there in 1977, said spokewoman <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Scott </PERSON>. Organizers in <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION> hope to capitalize on a similar wave of public interest to draw at least 500,000 visitors to `` Son of Heaven.'' Proceeds must meet an estimated $ 6.35 million in expenses, they say. About 500,000 people saw `` Son of Heaven'' last year in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> _ the show's only other stop in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. As for future projects in <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION>, who knows? The Columbus Museum of Art is toying with the idea of trying to raise $ 60 million to $ 80 million for an expansion by the year 2000. `` It's possible,'' Ms. <PERSON> Parsons </PERSON> said. `` After this -LRB- exhibit -RRB-, I really think it's possible.''

 The judge in <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s Iran-Contra trial abruptly adjourned the proceedings today during a dispute over the use of classified information during cross examination of witness <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Owen </PERSON>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Gerhard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> sent the jury home for the rest of the day and cleared the courtroom to hold a closed hearing on the classified information at issue. The adjournment came after a heated bench conference during which the judge was overheard telling prosecutors, `` my ruling is the name must come in,'' indicating the dispute involved disclosing the name of a secret source. The dispute arose as <PERSON> Owen </PERSON>, who was North's courier to <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, was being questioned about a 1985 trip he took to <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION> to view the site of an airfield for rebel resupply operations. `` Ladies and gentlemen,'' a clearly angry <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> told jurors, `` I am going to excuse you for the day and try to get this roadblock straightened out.'' The dispute arose before the noon lunch break when defense attorney <PERSON> Brendan </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> proposed introducing a document into evidence as part of his cross-examination of <PERSON> Owen </PERSON>. The judge asked to see the document over the lunch hour. When the trial reconvened, <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> apparently ruled during a bench conference that the information was relevant to the case, prompting a half-hour recess while prosecutors consulted with government security experts. Another bench conference ensued when court reconvened after the recess. <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> spoke to prosecutor <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Keker </PERSON> so angrily that his voice could be heard at times in the rear of the courtroom. `` I have offered you an opportunity to withdraw the witness,'' the judge was overheard telling <PERSON> Keker </PERSON>. Later he told <PERSON> Keker </PERSON>: `` I am willing to try to help you get a stipulation'' to facts that would be brought out in defense cross-examination. Earlier in the day, <PERSON> Owen </PERSON> said that as <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> was cutting off aid to the Contras, <PERSON> North </PERSON> called himself the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration's `` point man'' for helping the Nicaraguan rebels and its `` fall guy'' if things went awry <PERSON> North </PERSON> said `` he was to be, in essence, the point man,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Owen </PERSON>, who ferried intelligence reports, tacital advice and money from the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> aide to the Contras. The conversation occurred in the spring of 1984 when <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> banned military aid to the Contras, <PERSON> Owen </PERSON> said. `` He was to be the one responsible for keeping the Nicaraguan Resistance alive,'' <PERSON> Owen </PERSON> told jurors as the second week of testimony in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION>'s trial got under way in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Court. <PERSON> North </PERSON> told him `` he was going to be the one to take responsibility, in essence, to protect those who were higher than he in the government,'' <PERSON> Owen </PERSON> said under questioning by defense attorney <PERSON> Brendan </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>. <PERSON> Owen </PERSON> quoted <PERSON> North </PERSON> as saying `` ` the scenario had been arranged and OK'd through my superiors in the government' and I believe he said <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Casey </PERSON>'' _ the late <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> director North, a retired <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> lieutenant colonel and former <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> aide, faces 12 felony charges stemming from his involvement in the Iran-Contra affair. The charges, which carry a maximum penalty of 60 years' imprisonment upon conviction, include allegations that <PERSON> North </PERSON> lied to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> about his covert support of the rebels when such aid was banned by the so-called <ORGANIZATION> Boland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Amendments </ORGANIZATION>, first enacted in 1984 To blunt charges that <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s conduct was illegal, the defense is trying to show that he acted at all times with the express authority of top administration officials, including President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. <PERSON> Owen </PERSON> said that throughout their two-year association, <PERSON> North </PERSON> would often consult with <PERSON> Casey </PERSON>. He said that during visits to the Old Executive Office Building he would, on occasion, see <PERSON> Casey </PERSON> emerge from <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s office as he was going in. North would talk on the telephone with <PERSON> Casey </PERSON> and other <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> officials while he was in the office, <PERSON> Owen </PERSON> said. `` My name was never mentioned, but there were discussions about what he was doing,'' <PERSON> Owen </PERSON> said. These discussions with <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> officials included obtaining intelligence maps and the possible reassignment of someone involved in the resistance movement, he added. <PERSON> Owen </PERSON> said the maps he carried to the Contra rebels came from `` across the river'' _ the euphemism used by <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> officials for the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Owen </PERSON> said he made an agreement with independent counsel <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> to cooperate with the investigation and receive immunity from prosecution even though he did n't think he had broken any laws helping the Contras. `` I would n't suggest I intended to be a witness in this case but I certainly signed the agreement,'' <PERSON> Owen </PERSON> said, expressing his support for North.

 <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> accused its <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> pact ally <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> of grave human rights violations and said Monday it will join Western countries calling for the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> to investigate the situation. It is believed to be the first time a communist country urges the world body to investigate alleged abuses in another <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc state. `` We are concerned that human rights and fundamental freedoms are, in our judgment, gravely violated in <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> and this judgment is shared by many other countries,'' Hungarian Deputy Foreign Minister <PERSON> Gyula </PERSON> <PERSON> Horn </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. `` We are convinced that meeting the requirement of respect for human rights is irrespective of a country's belonging to a system of alliance and its social system,'' he told the 43-nation commission. <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s proposals to deal with the problem bilaterally with <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> had brought no results, so the country is ready to co-sponsor a resolution initiated by <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION> that urges the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> to appoint a special investigator into <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>'s human rights situation, <PERSON> Horn </PERSON> said. He cited alleged violations ranging from the demolition of villages and destruction of cultural and historic values to forced assimilation of minorities and curbs on religious freedom. At a news conference after his address, <PERSON> Horn </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> did not consult the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> or its other communist allies before making its decision. In December, <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> became the first communist country to ratify a key human rights protocol allowing citizens to address individual complaints of alleged rights violations to a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> panel. <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> also was the first communist state to decide Friday to ratify a 1951 convention defining rights of refugees. According to Hungarian statistics, about 15,000 Romanians have sought asylum in neighboring <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, most of them illegally crossing the border. <PERSON> Horn </PERSON> said 85 percent of refugees are ethnic Hungarians, although arrivals include members of German and other minorities, as well as Romanians. Some stretches of the 186-mile border are virtually unguarded, while guards are posted every 100 yards at other areas, he said. <PERSON> Horn </PERSON> was asked about the fate of refugees who are caught. `` There are some who never reappear,'' he said. `` They are those who are heavily beaten. There are all kinds of punishments.'' But he added he was not aware of any shooting. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> journalist <PERSON> Sue </PERSON> <PERSON> Lloyd-Roberts </PERSON> said she and colleague <PERSON> Vivian </PERSON> <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> were arrested four times for clandestinely photographing areas of <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> allegedly wrecked by President <PERSON> Nicolae </PERSON> <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON>'s modernization plans. She smuggled out her footage, broadcast Monday in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, by hiding it in her underwear. The footage showed empty, brick-strewn fields where three villages had stood until last fall. `` <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON> wants to create his ` Communist Man,' and he has to destroy the Romanian village because that's where the opposition to communism is total,'' said Romanian emigre leader <PERSON> Ion </PERSON> <PERSON> Rativ </PERSON>. The report said people spoke of villagers being killed resisting eviction. The demolitions are part of <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON>'s plan to raze 7,000 of <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>'s 13,000 villages and resettle people in so-called agro-industrial centers. An unidentified woman was shown describing what happened: `` They destroyed everyone's home. My house was knocked to the ground. They've made us live in new blocks. Everything is wretched and miserable. What can be done?''

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dvorine </LOCATION>, an optometrist who was the first <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> to develop a test for colorblindness, has died. He was 89. <PERSON> Dvorine </PERSON>, who practiced optometry in the <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION> area for more than 40 years, died Friday. He never graduated from high school, but after working in an optical lab he attended the <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> College of Optometry where he earned a doctor of optometry degree in the late 1920s. <PERSON> Dvorine </PERSON> was most noted for the design and publication of a set of `` pseudo-isochromatic plates,'' charts with a series of colored dots used to test for colorblindness.

 Student radicals with firebombs battled riot police Monday in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> and five other cities to protest President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s visit to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. No serious injuries were reported, but dissidents said about 70 people were detained. A major clash broke out in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> when about 700 radical students and dissidents, throwing rocks and firebombs, battled riot police around <ORGANIZATION> Dongguk </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. `` <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> go home!'' and `` Down with military dictatorship!'' protesters shouted, as they began a march to the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION>, three miles away. The protesters, carrying red and blue flags, tried to march into the streets after a rally on campus, where they burned effigies of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and South Korean President <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> Tae-woo. Marchers beating drums led the procession. `` Drive out the imperialist <ORGANIZATION> Yankees </ORGANIZATION> and their military regime!'' a radical leader screamed. Protesters applauded and took up the chant. Other radical leaders denounced <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, charging that <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> keeps troops in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> to enforce a colonial-style rule. About 42,000 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops are stationed in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> under a mutual defense treaty. Dozens of protesters surged from the pack and hurled firebombs at riot police, touching off vicious fighting that lasted 45 minutes. Several officers were set afire after being hit by firebombs, but the flames were extinguished quickly. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> for a brief visit on his way home from <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, moved around the capital by helicopter and was not near the violence. The government mobilized 20,000 riot police in central <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> to block protests. Anti-Americanism was a casual subject in the conversation between <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> before they started formal talks, and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> asked why even a small number of Korean students staged violent protests, officials said. <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> replied there is a small group of radicals who subscribe to communist ideology and class struggle, the officials said. There also is a group of people who believe <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> is subservient to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, they said. In the southern city of <LOCATION> Kwangju </LOCATION>, hundreds of radicals fought with riot police firing tear gas. Clashes also were reported in <LOCATION> Kunsan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Taegu </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pusan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Chongju </LOCATION>. Police broke up an attempt by prominent dissident leaders to march to the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> to deliver a letter addressed to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> demanding an end to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military presence in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. About 15 dissident leaders shouting slogans and carrying pictures of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> with red crosses drawn through them were hauled away after trying to assemble about a block from the embassy in downtown <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>. `` No <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> visit!'' the small band shouted before they were overwhelmed by charging police, who kicked and punched some of the protesters. Minutes after the protest, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s helicopter passed overhead on its way to the presidential mansion, the <ORGANIZATION> Blue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, to meet <PERSON> Roh </PERSON>. Hundreds of riot police ringed the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> and other <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> facilities because of radicals' threats to hold anti-American protests. Police stepped up street checks on pedestrians downtown. The letter to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, released by the nation's main dissident alliance, called for the withdrawal of all <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces from <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> and charged that <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> ruled the nation like a colony. `` U.S.A. is the source of all suppression and sorrow to <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> people since the division of the <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> peninsula,'' the letter said. The letter accused the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> of dividing the <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> peninsula and keeping troops in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> to prevent its reunification with <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. It also denounced <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> for seeking greater access for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> imports to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. Radicals say <PERSON> Roh </PERSON>'s government is a military dictatorship controlled by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Radical students have little public support because of their violent and extreme views, but they can assemble thousands of activists and often clash with riot police.

<HEAD>Priest Offers $100 Bounty For Handguns</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOE WHEELAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A priest who announced at Mass that he would pay $ 100 for every handgun turned in at his church said Monday that calls are pouring in and he has four guns in hand already. Three of the four people who acted on Sunday's offer have turned down the $ 100, the Rev. <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> <PERSON> Gourley </PERSON> added. This is <PERSON> Gourley </PERSON>'s second effort to rid his flock of firearms. Last year, he urged his parishioners at <LOCATION> Our </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lady </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Guadalupe </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Church </LOCATION> in north <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> to turn in their handguns, and had 12 takers from the parish of 1,800 people. This time, he thought a financial incentive might make the program more successful. `` One of the things people mentioned a year ago is that people had made a financial investment in their guns and asking them to simply give them up might be asking too much,'' <PERSON> Gourley </PERSON> said. So he set aside more than $ 2,000 donated to the church recently by a parishioner who had told him to use the money for something other than church repairs or the church budget. `` It seemed maybe we could turn the money given to us for use as fertilizer and maybe have the tree produce more fruit,'' he said. <PERSON> Gourley </PERSON> said his Roman Catholic parish has held about one funeral a month for gunshot victims over the past year, but it was two recent funerals _ for a shooting victim and a suicide _ that prompted him to offer money for guns. Over the years, <PERSON> Gourley </PERSON>'s parish also has sheltered Central American refugees, the homeless and victims of abuse. `` Anything that strikes at human dignity is something we try to address,'' he said. `` Guns certainly meet that criterion. The suffering they inflict on people certainly strikes at human dignity and the very value of life itself.'' <PERSON> Gourley </PERSON> made his pitch at four Masses on Sunday, saying the Holy Spirit had moved him to offer money for guns. `` Some people were a little surprised,'' he said. `` Not everyone was in agreement with our reaction to the whole menace of guns in our society. But there are a great many people who are supportive, too.'' Four handguns were turned in Sunday, with only one person accepting the $ 100. `` And from telephone calls in the last half hour, three or four more are on the way,'' <PERSON> Gourley </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Gourley </PERSON> said the handguns will be turned over to police to be destroyed. `` We have enough money now to buy 20 or 25 guns,'' he said. `` When we get to the point where we do n't have any money, we'll see if we can find money, or go down to the mall and sing and dance and take up a collection.'' `` I will ask for donations from gun shops and funeral homes. They have been making a lot of money lately.'' One parishioner asked <PERSON> Gourley </PERSON> if people might not `` go out and dig up guns just to get the $ 100. `` I said, ` Fine, take advantage of me. That's one less gun. Is a human life worth $ 100? Are the bitter tears of a mother worth $ 100?'''

 Subway gunman <PERSON> Bernhard </PERSON> <PERSON> Goetz </PERSON>'s last hope of cutting short his jail term ended Monday when the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> upheld his gun possession conviction in the shooting of four teen-agers on a subway. `` It looks like this is the end of the line,'' said <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, <PERSON> Goetz </PERSON>'s co-counsel. `` Hopefully, he'll get early parole and that'll be the end of the criminal matter. <PERSON> Goetz </PERSON>, 41, becomes eligible for parole Sunday after serving 51 days of a one-year sentence stemming from the Dec. 22, 1984, shootings, said <PERSON> Ruby </PERSON> <PERSON> Ryles </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Correction </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, without comment, rejected arguments that <PERSON> Goetz </PERSON> was denied a fair trial because a judge told jurors they `` must'' _ rather than `` may'' _ convict him if they found that the illegal possession charge had been proved beyond a reasonable doubt. <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> McKelvey </PERSON>, a spokesman for <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> District Attorney <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Morgenthau </PERSON>, said the prosecutor would not comment. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said he had spoken with <PERSON> Goetz </PERSON> last week, and <PERSON> Goetz </PERSON> had anticipated the ruling would go against him. <PERSON> Goetz </PERSON>, who also was fined $ 5,000, began serving his sentence at <LOCATION> Rikers </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> on Jan. 13 and also spent time in prison upon his arrest. Supporters portrayed <PERSON> Goetz </PERSON> as a hero while detractors labeled him a vigilante and a racist. <PERSON> Goetz </PERSON> is white. The four teen-agers he shot are black. <PERSON> Goetz </PERSON> was acquitted of attempted murder, assault and reckless endangerment in 1987, and convicted on just a single weapons possession count.

 The `` gumbo'' clay of central <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> is wearing out the brakes on the new $ 25,000 all-terrain vehicles the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> is buying to replace the venerable jeep. Army posts around the world are using the new High Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicle, but the brake problem appears unique to those used at <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Polk </LOCATION>, said post spokesman <PERSON> Orina </PERSON> <PERSON> Fulton </PERSON>. About 10 percent of the post's 700 HMMWVs are showing premature wear on the brake pads, <PERSON> Fulton </PERSON> said. The vehicles were delivered in July and brake trouble showed up in December, he said. He blamed the thick gumbo clay _ so called because of its soft, sticky consistency _ that is common in <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>. `` If you're familiar with <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Polk </LOCATION> and the surrounding areas, it looks like sand on top, but underneath you've got soft, red clay,'' <PERSON> Fulton </PERSON> said. `` The soil gets onto the brake pads and is staying there.'' Jeeps had no trouble with the clay because they had enclosed drum brakes. The new vehicle, described as a larger, wider version of the jeep, has exposed disc brakes, <PERSON> Fulton </PERSON> said. The vehicle, nicknamed the Hummer, is manufactured in <LOCATION> Mishawaka </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ind. </LOCATION>, by <ORGANIZATION> AM </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, a division of the <ORGANIZATION> LTV </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Missiles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Electronics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>.

 The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Monday that the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> `` can not escape responsibility'' for an attack by three guerrillas on <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers and <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> militiamen in southern <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. Spokesman <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> administration would `` convey this message'' at its next meeting with <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> representatives in <LOCATION> Tunisia </LOCATION>. The guerrillas were from the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> for the <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION>, which claimed three <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers and two Christian militiamen were killed. Israeli authorities said the guerrillas' mission was a raid on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and that there were no fatalities before they were gunned down The group is considered a radical faction, but <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> stressed it is part of the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>, which would be held accountable by the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government. `` The <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> can not escape responsibility for the actions of its constituent elements,'' the spokesman said. <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> added: `` We have made it clear to the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> that these kinds of operations have a negative impact on the U.S.-PLO dialogue and on the atmosphere necessary for a positive <LOCATION> Palestinian-Israeli </LOCATION> dialogue. We do not condone this type of activity.'' The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman and then Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> were also harshly critical of the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> for an earlier clash involving two other <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> factions in southern <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. But there is no indication the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration will break off talks with Chairman <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s organization. Begun last December by the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration, the talks were based on a pledge by <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> to renounce terrorism and accepting <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s right to exist. Several <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials, including <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON>, then the assistant secretary of state for <LOCATION> Near </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> affairs, said the dialogue would be suspended if the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> engaged in terrorism. But <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said on Feb. 11, after the first incident, `` we are not prepared at this time to say this constitutes action by the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> to cause us to break off the dialogue.'' At the same time, he said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Pelletreau </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassador to <LOCATION> Tunisia </LOCATION>, had informed <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> officials that `` actions such as this _ directed against civilian or military targets, inside or outside of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> _ were something that gave us trouble.'' <PERSON> Pelletreau </PERSON> has had four meetings with <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> representatives since the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration ended a 13-year ban on dealing with the <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> organization. `` There is going to be a meeting on that subject, but as for timing, I really do n't have anything yet,'' <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said, referring to the incident last Thursday about a mile north of the Israeli border. Meanwhile, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Quandt </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> analyst who is now a scholar with the <ORGANIZATION> Brookings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institution </ORGANIZATION>, said the talks with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> had fallen short of <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> expectations and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> promises. <PERSON> Quandt </PERSON>, who met recently with <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> and other <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> officials in <LOCATION> Tunis </LOCATION>, said they were `` a bit frustrated and disappointed with the virtual non-existence of the U.S.-PLO dialogue.'' He said at a news conference: `` They had been promised at the time the dialogue began there would be substantive talks. There have been virtually none.'' Asked about <PERSON> Quandt </PERSON>'s account, <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said he `` could n't speak to someone else's expectations.'' The spokesman said the decision to talk to the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> `` was made at the end of the previous administration, and we're now in the early stages of a new administration. But beyond that, I do n't really have any way to interpret somebody else's expectations.'' On another subject, <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> offered the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s `` warmest congratulations'' to <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> on the signing Sunday of agreements on <LOCATION> Taba </LOCATION>, a tiny beach enclave on the <LOCATION> Red </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> had taken control of <LOCATION> Taba </LOCATION> when it defeated <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> in the 1967 Six-Day War and captured the <LOCATION> Sinai </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peninsula </LOCATION>. All of the territory except for the 750-yard-long resort had been returned as part of the 1979 peace treaty between the two countries. <PERSON> Redman </PERSON>, reading from a statement, said the agreements udner which <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> is yielding <LOCATION> Taba </LOCATION> and a hotel it built there were `` a tribute to the serious and statesmanlike approach adopted by the two parties.'' He said the agreements also proved that negotiations worked between parties of good will.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> has been authorized to buy an additional 2 million metric tons of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> wheat at subsidized prices, the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Monday. Acting Undersecretary <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldberg </PERSON> said the wheat will be available to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> under the department's Export Enhancement Program, or EEP. A metric ton is about 2,205 pounds and is equal to 36.7 bushels of wheat. Under EEP arrangement, private exporters can sell <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> commodities at reduced prices in order to meet foreign competition in selected overseas markets and then collect free government surpluses of grain or other commodities as bonuses, or subsidies. The subsidies have ranged from less than $ 20 to more than $ 40 per ton of wheat, or in the range of 54 cents to $ 1.09 per bushel. Under previous <ORGANIZATION> EEP </ORGANIZATION> authorizations, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> has bought more than 7.4 million tons of wheat for delivery in 1988-89. Only 10,000 tons remained in the previous authorization issued on Dec. 30. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> is the biggest foreign customer of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> wheat farmers this year, and also expected to be the world's largest single importer of wheat in 1988-89. According to <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> projections, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> may import about 15 million tons of wheat from all foreign sources, while the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> is expected to import 13 million tons. The Soviets, as of Feb. 23, had bought about 3 million tons of wheat from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, compared with the 7.4 million tons by <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. All of the 1988-89 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> wheat sales to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> have been subsidized.

 The government said Monday it resented the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> having invited a leading dissident to a banquet given by President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, and regretted that a fuss was made when police barred him from attending. Chinese intellectuals, meanwhile, said the action against <PERSON> Fang </PERSON> <PERSON> Lizhi </PERSON> was `` stupid,'' `` neolithic'' and `` unacceptable.'' <PERSON> Fang </PERSON>, an internationally respected astrophysicist who has criticized Marxism and called for democratic reform in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, was invited to the banquet along with his wife, <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Shuxian </PERSON>. But dozens of police converged to block his car and bar him from entering the hotel where the Texas-style barbecue was held Sunday. Police then refused to allow him to ride in a taxi and made a bus driver pass a stop where he was waiting. `` All the arrangements concerning President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s stay in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> had been agreed upon by both sides beforehand,'' the official <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said, quoting an unidentified <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman. `` The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> side, without consulting the Chinese side, invited <PERSON> Fang </PERSON> to attend the dinner, which was especially in honor of Chinese leaders. Therefore, the Chinese side resented this,'' the spokesman said. Visiting world leaders generally hold banquets for their <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> hosts, but it would be highly unusual for them to submit the guest list for Chinese approval `` Some people'' are trying to `` make an issue'' of <PERSON> Fang </PERSON>'s absence, said the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman `` We feel sorry that such a thing should happen,'' <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> quoted the spokesman as saying. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told Vice Premier <PERSON> Wu </PERSON> <PERSON> Xueqian </PERSON> at the airport he regretted the actions that kept <PERSON> Fang </PERSON> away. At <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s direction, <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> Winston </PERSON> <PERSON> Lord </PERSON> met with Vice Foreign Minister <PERSON> Zhu </PERSON> <PERSON> Qizhen </PERSON> later and `` reiterated the regret that the president had expressed,'' said <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> McKinney </PERSON> <PERSON> Russell </PERSON>. <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> said <PERSON> Lord </PERSON> also asked for `` clarification of what the circumstances were.'' <PERSON> Fang </PERSON> told reporters Monday that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s statement of regret was `` a beginning'' but added: `` I hope they -LRB- the Americans -RRB- say something more in the next few days.'' `` Regarding the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> I have a principled criticism: I want it to adopt a single standard toward human rights and not a double standard,'' he said. `` I think there are indeed some double standards'' in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>' open criticism of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s human rights record but not <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s. But <PERSON> Fang </PERSON> added, `` Of course, we Chinese must win our own human rights for ourselves.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> did not raise human rights issues during his two days of meetings with Chinese leaders. However, senior leader <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaoping </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> General Secretary <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> <PERSON> Ziyang </PERSON> stressed that domestic stability is more important now than democratic reform. <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> said dissident demands for `` multiparty and parliamentarian politics'' in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> are unrealistic under current conditions and will only undermine efforts to reform the nation's central planning economic system. However, <PERSON> Fang </PERSON> said, `` Only after democracy is achieved can the reforms be carried out. People must independently supervise the government.'' `` I ca n't change my views because of fear,'' he said, pledging to continue speaking out. He said many fellow intellectuals telephoned him Monday to express support. <PERSON> Bei </PERSON> <PERSON> Dao </PERSON>, a poet, said he was worried that the incident could be the prelude to a political crackdown after a period of relative cultural freedom. `` I was all ready to go back to my work and forget about politics,'' he said. `` But if this is how they are openly interfering in human rights, then I must fight back.'' <PERSON> Bei </PERSON> is the author of a recent open letter signed by 100 others who called for the release of political prisoners. The letter echoed an earlier one, written by <PERSON> Fang </PERSON> in January. <PERSON> Dai </PERSON> <PERSON> Qing </PERSON>, a leading journalist who attended the banquet, said she was shocked by the news. `` Their methods are neolithic,'' she said. `` Our government has changed so much for the better, it was pitiful for them to do this now.'' <PERSON> Fang </PERSON> gained fame in 1986 with eloquent speeches to college students in which he called for democracy and human rights. Authorities blamed him for a nationwide wave of student demonstrations in the winter of 1986-87 and expelled him from the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. They barred him this year from traveling to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to attend a scientific conference and teach.

<HEAD>Army Says Warrant Officer to Face Court-Martial</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 An Army warrant officer accused of spying for the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact has waived his right to a grand jury-type proceeding and will face an immediate court-martial starting next week, the service said Monday. The case has been referred to trial as a `` non-capital case,'' however, meaning if convicted the maximum punishment would be life in prison, the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> added. Warrant Officer <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hall </PERSON>, 30, of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, was arrested Dec. 21 near <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ga. </LOCATION>, after allegedly admitting to an <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> undercover agent that he had been passing classified intelligence information to the Soviets and East Germans for the past six years. On Jan. 4, <PERSON> Hall </PERSON> was formally charged with 10 counts of espionage, attempted espionage and failing to obey regulations. The Army has asserted that Hall, an intelligence analyst with a top secret security clearance, delivered exposed film and documents dealing with `` communications intelligence, a means of defense or retaliation against large-scale attack, war plans and military satellites.'' At the time of his arrest, <PERSON> Hall </PERSON> was assigned to the 24th Infantry Division and worked as an intelligence analyst in the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>'s G-2 intelligence section. He joined the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> in September 1976 and spent most of his career working in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> as an analyst of intercepted radio and telephone traffic and coded messages. Legally, <PERSON> Hall </PERSON> could have insisted the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> conduct a so-called Article 32 hearing _ a proceeding that resembles a civilian grand jury hearing to determine if a court-martial is warranted. The soldier decided to waive that hearing, however, `` and the court-martial of Warrant Officer Hall will convene on March 6, 1989, at <ORGANIZATION> Fort </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> McNair </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> added. `` It is anticipated that <PERSON> Hall </PERSON>, as is his right, will request to be tried by judge alone. He will be tried by Military Judge Col. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Eggers </PERSON>, the chief of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> States </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION>.'' It was not immediately clear why the case against <PERSON> Hall </PERSON> was being referred to trial as a non-capital case. Under a revision to the Uniform Code of Military Justice approved by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> several years ago, the most serious espionage cases can be tried as capital cases with the death penalty as maximum punishment. The <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> said Monday that much of the proceeding involving Hall would be closed to the media and public because of the classified nature of the evidence.

 <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Owen </PERSON>, who shuttled from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> with help for the Contra fighters, said in a 1986 memo that rebel leader <PERSON> Adolfo </PERSON> <PERSON> Calero </PERSON> surrounded himself with second-rate people who `` are liars and greed and power motivated.'' The six-page memo from <PERSON> Owen </PERSON> to <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON> was introduced into evidence Friday at <LOCATION> North </LOCATION>'s trial and released by the court on Monday. It was from `` TC'' to `` BG'' _ pseudonyms <PERSON> Owen </PERSON> used for himself, `` The Courier,'' and <PERSON> North </PERSON>, `` Blood and Guts.'' `` Perhaps <PERSON> Adolfo </PERSON> <PERSON> Calero </PERSON> is the man to lead <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> back to democracy,'' <PERSON> Owen </PERSON> wrote North on March 17, 1986, when <PERSON> North </PERSON> was a <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> aide. `` He is a creation of the USG -LRB- <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government -RRB- and so he is the horse we chose to ride. Have no problem with this, as long as we know and understand his shortcomings.'' The best way to do that, <PERSON> Owen </PERSON> said, was to look at the people <PERSON> Calero </PERSON> trusted. `` Unfortunately, they are not first rate people; in fact they are liars and greed and power motivated. They are not the people to rebuild a new <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Owen </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, headed by <PERSON> Calero </PERSON> `` has done a good job of keeping competent people out of the organization.'' <PERSON> Calero </PERSON> testified in the trial last week, praising <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s efforts on behalf of the Contras. Later in his memo, <PERSON> Owen </PERSON> told <PERSON> North </PERSON> that a coalition of Contra groups called <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nicaraguan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Opposition </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> UNO </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- `` is a name only'' and `` there is no substance.'' `` I care and believe in the boys and girls, men and women who are fighting, bleeding, dying,'' <PERSON> Owen </PERSON> said, contending that few of the leaders of the movement did. `` This war has become a business to many of them; there is still a belief the Marines are going to have to invade, so let's get set so we will automatically be the ones put in power,'' he wrote. At the end of the memo, <PERSON> Owen </PERSON> said he would like to `` move on'' and get involved in counterterrorism. `` I will continue in whatever position you recommend,'' he concluded. `` You have been my Godfather through this.''

 <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Haggerty </PERSON> lost to city hall, lost in state court and on Monday lost in the highest court in the land, but he vowed he'll continue his $ 50,000 fight _ over the size of his mailbox. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> on Monday let stand, without comment, a lower court ruling that <PERSON> Haggerty </PERSON>'s mailbox _ or at least the 15-foot-high structure it was part of _ had to go. <PERSON> Haggerty </PERSON>, a towing service mechanic, said from his home the decision was expected. `` Let no one wonder why respect for the legal system is collapsing,'' he said. `` But it's not over until I give up, and I have n't given up yet.'' He said he would consult his attorneys about further action. At the city attorney's office, <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON> <PERSON> Delegal </PERSON>, the latest in a string of lawyers who handled the case, said she hoped the decision ends the matter. `` We're pleased, to say the least,'' Ms. <PERSON> Delegal </PERSON> said. `` The bottom line was that the structure, which was much bigger than a mail box, was on public property. The city just felt very uncomfortable with it.'' The structure was built in front of his house in the spring of 1982, and within a few months had aroused the wrath of local officials. Anchored by two subterranean truck engine blocks, two water pipes rose 15 feet in the air. The mail receptacle was attached to a horizontal bar about three feet above the ground. A second horizontal bar several feet above the receptacle served as the base of a flagpole. The structure, about six feet wide at its widest point, contained an old bed frame, part of a golf cart and was topped off by a model airplane with an `` air mail'' designation. About nine months after <PERSON> Haggerty </PERSON> completed it, city officials told him the mail box violated a city ordinance barring obstructions in the public right-of-way portion of his property. <PERSON> Haggerty </PERSON> said he was initially accused of blocking traffic _ despite the fact that he lives at the end of a dead-end street. <PERSON> Haggerty </PERSON> lost a first round in court, and the city removed the structure. He won on appeal, and built another one _ this time 22 feet tall _ to take its place. The city won round three, and <PERSON> Haggerty </PERSON> was forced to remove the second structure. He then sought help from the nation's highest court. His appeal contended, among other things, that the city ordinance is violating his freedom of expression. Lawyers for the city urged the justices to reject <PERSON> Haggerty </PERSON>'s appeal, arguing that he is free to express himself somewhere else on his property, off the public right-of-way

<HEAD>Sheriff's Deputy Charged With Slaying Three Prostitutes</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A sheriff's deputy was charged with three counts of murder Monday in the slayings of three prostitutes, and officials said special circumstance allegations could mean the death penalty if he is convicted. <PERSON> Rickey </PERSON> <PERSON> Ross </PERSON>, 40, a <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> deputy, was arrested Thursday for investigation of murder in the slayings in the gang-infested south-central area of the city. <PERSON> Andy </PERSON> <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON>, a spokesman for the prosecutor, said the special-circumstance allegations were for multiple murder. Under <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> law, a convicted murderer also found guilty of special circumstance allegations can be put to death rather than sentenced to life imprisonment. <PERSON> Ross </PERSON>, a narcotics investigator with the department for 18 years, was arrested for investigation of three killings, but published and broadcast reports have said police are investigating as many as 12 deaths of the south-central district's `` strawberries,'' the street name for prostitutes who sell sex for drugs. Attorney <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaffe </PERSON>, who spoke to <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> on Sunday, said he hoped police had not rushed to arrest <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> in reaction to criticism of the department's tactics in investigating the series of prostitute deaths. `` I hope that he is not the scapegoat for what appeared to be public pressure brought on the police department to come up with a suspect,'' <PERSON> Jaffe </PERSON> said. Some sheriff's department officials had said Sunday that a gun found in <PERSON> Ross </PERSON>' car, reportedly a 9mm semiautomatic pistol, was so badly rusted that ballistics experts were having problems positively linking the weapon to the one used to kill the prostitutes. `` This case is going to be made or broken on the ballistics, and from what we hear, the ballistics are pretty shaky,'' one law enforcement officer told the <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>. But the Times quoted another unidentified police investigator who said a `` positive comparison'' had been made of bullets fired from the gun taken from the car trunk and those recovered from the bodies of the three prostitutes. `` We would n't put an active-duty sheriff's deputy in jail for homicide on an ` iffy' make,'' he said. <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> was stopped in the south-central district while driving in a department car, sitting with an alleged prostitute at his side, authorities said Friday. The woman told police she and <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> had been smoking rock cocaine.

<TEXT>
 The attorney for `` Night Stalker'' murder defendant <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramirez </PERSON> is suffering from trial-related nervous exhaustion, the judge said Monday, and the prosecutor said they might have to start the trial over. `` Probably the chances of a mistrial are good,'' Deputy District Attorney <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Halpin </PERSON> said. `` We ca n't keep this jury hanging around indefinitely.'' A mistrial would mean a new jury would need to be selected in the 3 -LCB- - year-old case <PERSON> Ramirez </PERSON>, 28, is charged with 13 murders and 30 related felonies in a series of grisly nighttime attacks that terrified <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> in the summer of 1985. Testimony began Jan. 30 after six months of jury selection. A doctor's report submitted to the judge said attorney <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON> is suffering from stress-related nervous exhaustion resulting from his participation in the long-delayed trial. The doctor recommended psychological counseling and said recovery could take six weeks. `` The doctor feels he is not presently able to function effectively as trial counsel,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Tynan </PERSON>, who declined to disclose the doctor's name. Jurors had been excused since <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON> called in sick Tuesday. `` This is a novel experience for the court,'' said <PERSON> Tynan </PERSON>, adding that he would hold hearings before he decides on a remedy for the situation. He ordered <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON> and his former co-counsel, <PERSON> Arturo </PERSON> <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON>, no relation, to be in court Wednesday for an inquiry on the state of <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON>' health and the trial's future. <PERSON> Arturo </PERSON> <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON> disappeared from the case without public explanation during jury selection. He remains a counsel of record in the case, but <PERSON> Halpin </PERSON> said it was unlikely that he would be ordered to take over for his ailing colleague. During the 1985 crime spree, an intruder entered homes at night through unlocked windows or doors, then raped women, killed men and women with gunshots to the head, and stole jewelry and other valuables. One victim's eyes were gouged out, and the killer often left behind drawings of pentagrams, inverted five-pointed stars associated with devil worship. The press dubbed the killer the `` Night Stalker,'' and people in the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> area shut their windows at night despite a heat wave. Terror spread through the state as related crimes were reported in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Orange </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, where charges against <PERSON> Ramirez </PERSON> are pending. <PERSON> Ramirez </PERSON> was arrested after he was chased and beaten by an angry mob in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> during the 1985 Labor Day weekend, when his picture first appeared in newspapers as the prime suspect in the crime wave. During his 1985 arraignment, <PERSON> Ramirez </PERSON> yelled `` Hail Satan!'' and flashed a picture of a pentagram drawn on his palm. Several women testified at his 1986 preliminary hearing that after their husbands were murdered, they were raped and ordered to `` Swear to Satan.''

 A retired four-star <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> admiral has reimbursed the government $ 3,400 for using military personnel to help him move files and other possessions from <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION> to begin his retirement, the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> said Monday. The service, in a brief statement, said retired Adm. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A </PERSON>. `` Ace'' <PERSON> Lyons </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> `` was requested to reimburse the excess costs incurred by the government'' and has `` voluntarily paid'' $ 3,420.94 to the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Lyons </PERSON> made the payment after <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ball </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> `` determined that some of the benefits received by Adm. <PERSON> Lyons </PERSON> upon his retirement exceeded entitlements.'' <PERSON> Lyons </PERSON>, the former head of the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fleet </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>, left his job on Oct. 1, 1987 on short notice not long after <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lehman </PERSON> resigned as <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> secretary. <PERSON> Lyons </PERSON>' departure also came soon after he publicly complained about the manner in which the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> was overseeing operation of warships assigned to the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>. According to the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>, an anonymous complaint shortly after the admiral stepped down from active duty alleged that <PERSON> Lyons </PERSON> had improperly shipped personal property on a military plane. The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> said that <PERSON> Lyons </PERSON> had shipped some personal property on a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> plane when he left <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION>, but that those aircraft flights had not been ordered just for <PERSON> Lyons </PERSON>' benefit and the `` additional costs were minimal.'' He was asked to reimburse the $ 3,400, however, because the investigation also found that <PERSON> Lyons </PERSON> had asked `` four military personnel'' to help him in traveling from <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> to start his retirement. <PERSON> Lyons </PERSON> has said he had only a week's notice to prepare for retirement and that he did, in fact, ask four servicemen to help him move his files and other possessions from <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 The judge in <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s Iran-Contra trial adjourned court abruptly Monday to clear up a `` roadblock'' created by an apparent defense attempt to reveal a name the government wants to keep secret. It was the first serious disruption of the trial on national security grounds since the jury was sworn last Tuesday. The dispute arose over introduction of a document during cross-examination of <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Owen </PERSON>, who had acted as <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s courier shuttling maps, money and tactical advice to the rebels fighting the Sandinista government at a time official <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid was banned Arguments over use of classified information put the start of the trial in doubt for weeks, and some or all of the charges could still be dropped if the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration declares there must be no disclosure of information that the judge says is needed for North to have a fair trial. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Gerhard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> did not call the jury into court after the lunch break, but instead held a 15-minute conference with lawyers at the bench. He then adjourned court for a half hour, held another bench conference and declared the trial ready to proceed. But then prosecution lawyer <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Keker </PERSON> objected again. `` Ladies and gentlemen, I'm going to excuse you today; I'm going to get this roadblock straightened out,'' the judge told the jury, obviously angry. Afterward, he met behind closed doors with lawyers in the case for more than an hour. A spokesman for the court said <PERSON> Owen </PERSON> would be back on the witness stand when court opens at 9:30 a.m. Tuesday. During one bench conference the judge was overheard telling prosecutors: `` My ruling is the name must come in'' _ indicating the dispute involved disclosing the name of a source the government wants to keep secret. He offered the prosecution a chance to avoid disclosure, saying <PERSON> Owen </PERSON> could be withdrawn as a witness. That would mean <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> would have to instruct jurors to ignore <PERSON> Owen </PERSON>'s testimony all day Friday and Monday morning. The dispute started before the noon break. <PERSON> Owen </PERSON> was being questioned about a 1985 trip he took to <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION> to view the site of an airfield for rebel resupply operations. North lawyer <PERSON> Brendan </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> attempted to introduce a document and question him about it. A private bench conference followed and the judge sent the jury to lunch early. When the trial reconvened, <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> apparently ruled at a second bench conference that the defense was entitled to use the information. The ruling triggered a recess while prosecutors consulted with administration security experts. In the post-recess bench conference, <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON>'s agitated voice could be heard at times in the rear of the courtroom. `` I have offered you an opportunity to withdraw the witness,'' the judge told <PERSON> Keker </PERSON>. Later he said: `` I am willing to try to help you get a stipulation.'' A stipulation is an agreement by both sides to a fact or set of facts, without having to introduce particulars. Earlier Monday, <PERSON> Owen </PERSON> testified that <PERSON> North </PERSON> declared in 1984 he would be the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration's `` point man'' helping the Nicaraguan rebels after legal <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid was cut off. `` He was going to be the one to take responsibility and in essence protect those who were higher than he in the government,'' said <PERSON> Owen </PERSON>. `` He said, in essence, this scenario had been arranged and OK'd through my -LRB- North's -RRB- superiors And I believe he said <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Casey </PERSON> knew about this,'' <PERSON> Owen </PERSON> said, referring to the late <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> director. `` He said he would be the point man to keep the Nicaraguans alive and if things became public, when they went wrong, he would be the fall guy _ he used those words _ for the administration,'' <PERSON> Owen </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Owen </PERSON>, testifying under immunity from prosecution, said he was in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION>'s office in the White House complex several times when <PERSON> Casey </PERSON> either came in or was leaving. North's defense to many of the 12 criminal charges against him is that his actions in supplying aid and advice to the Contras _ after <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> forbade aid by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> intelligence agencies and the military _ were with the knowledge and approval of higher ups, including then-President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. On Monday, <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> and the lawyers tiptoed around references to the names of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and foreign officials whose identities could not be disclosed for national security reasons. `` He was a senior official,'' <PERSON> Owen </PERSON> said of one man from <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> headquarters he met in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jose </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION>. `` Your honor,'' said <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>, `` I do n't believe the name is classified. Could I give him the first letter of the last name to see if it's the same person we are talking about.'' The judge told <PERSON> Owen </PERSON> to write the name on a piece of paper. He summoned lawyers to the bench to look at it and after five minutes told <PERSON> Owen </PERSON>: `` Just refer to this name as ` CIA One.''' That was joined later by `` Costa Rica No. 1'' and his deputy, `` Costa Rica No. 2.'' <PERSON> Owen </PERSON> said that he and the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> station chief in <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION> toured a site for a rebel resupply airfield and that their trip was known to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassador there. That testimony, elicited by <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> under cross-examination, was an example of the defense's attempt to distribute knowledge of North's dealings among higher officials at a time when <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid was banned. <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> station chief <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON>, known as <PERSON> Tomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Castillo </PERSON>, was indicted on charges he illegally helped <PERSON> North </PERSON> set up the airfield in <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION> and lied to his superiors. That indictment was dismissed on procedural grounds, but independent counsel <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> has indicated he will bring the case anew.

 Snow driven by wind blasts of more than 110 mph shut down a pumping station on the trans-Alaska oil pipeline and halted the flow of oil in the line for several hours during the weekend, an official said. `` It cost some people a lot of sleep,'' said <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Alyeska </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pipeline </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co </ORGANIZATION>.

One of three pumps at Pump Station One failed Saturday when snow got into its ventilation system, melted and caused an electrical short, he said. The station's other two pumps failed that night when air intakes froze shut on their booster pumps, he said.

<HEAD>Canadian Insurer Pays Death Benefits To Terminally Ill Patients</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 An insurance executive doing volunteer work in an AIDS hospice in <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION> last year asked a dying man what he could do to help, and the patient said he could help him `` die with a little more dignity.'' The volunteer, <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Barbaro </PERSON>, president of the Canadian branch of <ORGANIZATION> Prudential </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, soon found a way for his company to pay death benefits to the dying, a program being hailed by AIDS support groups. `` Here was a situation where this young man's parents were in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, and he was alone,'' <PERSON> Barbaro </PERSON> recalled during a recent telephone interview with the <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jose </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION>. `` When he died there would be a fair amount of money _ $ 20,000 or $ 25,000 _ and yet he had nothing right now.'' <PERSON> Barbaro </PERSON> could do little to help the young man before he died. But <PERSON> Barbaro </PERSON>, 56, `` vowed that I would find a way to give some living benefits from our industry'' to other terminally ill patients. Working with company lawyers, actuaries and underwriters, he came up with the first policy to give terminally ill patients _ whether dying of AIDS or other causes _ part of their benefits before they die. `` We have been looking for a long time to see some leadership from the insurance industry -LRB- in the AIDS crisis -RRB-, and I think this is very creative and a tremendous step forward,'' said <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> <PERSON> Graff </PERSON>, legal director of <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gay </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advocates </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. He said he thought `` it's a very generous and caring thing for them to do.'' In the past year, hundreds of thousands of dollars have been paid out, with benefits ranging from 40 percent to 70 percent of the total benefit depending on the circumstances. The remainder of the benefits are paid to the beneficiary when the patient dies. <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Haims </PERSON>, an insurance analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Seidler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Amdec </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, said the move was not only a humanitarian gesture, but it `` makes good dollars and cents, too.'' `` This is something <ORGANIZATION> Prudential </ORGANIZATION> can really capitalize on,'' said <PERSON> Haims </PERSON>. `` Can you imagine the appeal in terms of advertising? Not only would you have an immediate following among gay and lesbian communities, but every humanitarian out there will be impressed by it. I'm impressed by it.'' <PERSON> Barbaro </PERSON> said he has received many inquiries from other insurance officials in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` They're looking very seriously at it, because there's no downside,'' said <PERSON> Barbaro </PERSON>, noting that insurance companies do n't lose money by making payments in advance. `` Conventional wisdom has always been that you do n't pay a claim until somebody has died,'' he said. `` But my question was, why not, if the numbers work out?'' <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Vecchione </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Prudential </ORGANIZATION>'s vice president for public relations in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, said the payments are not being made to policyholders in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> because `` there are many legal difficulties in this country which would have to be resolved.'' `` Canadian laws are different and our attorneys there feel we can proceed,'' he said. `` We will take a close look at what ensues in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Schatz </PERSON>, director of the group's <ORGANIZATION> AIDS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Project </ORGANIZATION> and a member of the AIDS advisory committee of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commissioners </ORGANIZATION>, called <ORGANIZATION> Prudential </ORGANIZATION>'s policy `` unique in the insurance industry'' and said it shows `` profits and compassion do not necessarily have to conflict.'' `` We have seen depressingly few creative health approaches coming out of the insurance industry,'' said <PERSON> Schatz </PERSON>. `` It's nice to see an exception.''

 The Pentagon is inching closer to several deadlines for important policy decisions as <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tower </PERSON>'s nomination to become defense secretary founders on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>. Foremost among those decisions are several involving the 1990 budget. While the four military services have prepared recommendations to achieve the spending cuts promised by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, officials would normally be receiving guidance from a defense secretary by now. `` If this drags on much longer, I do n't know when we're going to get a budget,'' observed one official who works in the financial arena and who spoke only on the condition of anonymity. Tower's nomination comes before the full <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Wednesday. The <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> recommended by an 11-9 vote last week that he not be confirmed. `` Is the department functioning? Sure,'' observed one source who insisted upon anonymity. `` We are awarding contracts every day and training people to fight every day. `` But, without a secretary of <ORGANIZATION> defense </ORGANIZATION>, we do n't have any kind of new team in the top bureaucratic positions. And that means months of delays down the road in having people geared up to deal with budget and policy matters.'' Beyond the budget problems, the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration is facing deadlines for policy decisions and debates have begun without the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> really being represented, said several sources, all of whom spoke on the condition they not be named. For example, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is scheduled to report Wednesday his view of a proposal to develop a limited Star Wars defense system known as the Accident Launch Protection System. On March 15, the president is to provide a study of how a new nuclear arms treaty with the Soviets would affect the structure of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> nuclear forces. By early May, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has promised completion of a special 90-day national security policy review. And at some point soon, he must advise <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> whether he wants to develop the single-warhead Midgetman missile or a rail-car version of the huge MX missile. Finally, the administration has pledged to oversee reform of the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>'s weapons-buying process in the wake of the continuing federal fraud investigation. `` We need somebody in the job,'' said one official. `` You ca n't muddle through forever.

 President <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Napoleon </PERSON> <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON>'s proposal to postpone the presidential election as demanded by leftist rebels was rejected Monday by the opposition-controlled legislature In a nationwide television address Sunday, <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON> proposed a cease-fire and direct negotiations with the insurgents on Tuesday in <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION>. He also called for postponing the March 19 election to April 30 _ a date the rebels have rejected as too early. The unicameral <ORGANIZATION> Legislative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> is controlled by the rightist <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nationalist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION>, or Arena. The rightists are favored to win the presidency from <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION>, and adamantly have rejected any postponement of the vote. <PERSON> Ricardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Alvarenga </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> and an Arena leader, said at a news conference that `` the election date is set, and it must be fulfilled. It is not by altering the constitutional order that problems are resolved.'' Rebel leader <PERSON> Salvador </PERSON> <PERSON> Samayoa </PERSON> said in an interview that <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON>'s `` proposal has problems and evident loopholes, but we will put out a constructive response, not a negative one. His group, the <ORGANIZATION> Farabundo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marti </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, had originally called for elections in September, but then said it would accept a vote in July. <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON>'s term expires June 1. The 63-year-old <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON>, who is suffering from terminal liver cancer, is expected to survive until then. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> had hailed <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON>'s proposal. `` In our judgment, this is potentially the most significant opportunity ever for peace in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, particularly the commitment of the government of <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> to undertake a cessation of hostilities if the <ORGANIZATION> FMLN </ORGANIZATION> agrees within 48 hours,'' <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON> acknowledged Sunday there would be constitutional problems with delaying the election, but suggested they could be resolved either through an accord involving the three branches of government, or by a plebiscite. The <ORGANIZATION> FMLN </ORGANIZATION> said in January if the election were postponed a significant time period, it would take part and respect the outcome. That was seen as a major turnabout by the Marxist-led rebels, who have boycotted and condemned the five previous national elections this decade. <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON> originally rejected the guerrilla proposal as insincere. He also had said postponement of the election past March 31 would be unconstitutional. He did not explain Sunday why April 30 could be considered a legal date. The constitution says elections must be held at least two months before the end of the incumbent's term. <PERSON> Alvarenga </PERSON> opposed the plebiscite proposal. `` Why have a plebiscite? The presidential election is a plebiscite, a consultation of the popular will, and it must be carried out as scheduled,'' he said. He said the legislature must analyze <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON>'s proposal. Leaders of the Democratic Convergence, a leftist alliance the guerrillas would support if they took part in the vote, said <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON>'s proposal had good and bad points. Convergence leader <PERSON> Ruben </PERSON> <PERSON> Zamora </PERSON> said at a news conference that direct talks could be productive, but that an April 30 election date `` is not acceptable and does not contribute to peace.'' The 7,000-member guerrilla army has been fighting the government's armed force of 56,000 for nine years. The civil war has ravaged the country and an estimated 70,000 people, most of them civilians, have been killed.

 <LOCATION> EL-BIREH </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Occupied </LOCATION> <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- _ A <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> teen-ager stabbed an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldier Monday and then was shot in the head and wounded as troops chased him through a crowded market, the army said. Radio reports said the assailant was injured with rubber bullets. Also Monday, a previously unknown Arab group claimed it was holding a paratrooper missing for 12 days. In clashes in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, soldiers shot and wounded 10 Palestinians, according to <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> reports and hospital officials. The military commander of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> town of <LOCATION> El-Bireh </LOCATION>, about 10 miles north of <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, said a Palestinian youth twice stabbed an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldier who was the last man in a routine patrol passing through a crowded market. The commander, a paratrooper colonel indentified only as <PERSON> Chai </PERSON>, said the soldier shouted `` I'm wounded!'' and ran with other troops after the 18-year-old attacker. As the assailant ran into the market, two soldiers fired and hit him once in the head and in the neck, <PERSON> Chai </PERSON> said. A border police soldier, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the wounded soldier tried to hit his attacker as the two lay side by side on stretchers, but soldiers separated them. The army identified the soldier as <PERSON> Ratib </PERSON> <PERSON> Subakh </PERSON>, a member of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> <PERSON> Druse </PERSON> minority. He was stabbed in the shoulder and was reported to have suffered minor to moderate wounds. His assailant was identified only as being only from <LOCATION> Ramallah </LOCATION>. His condition was not reported. The attack came three days after a paratrooper was killed in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> city of <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION> when a large concrete block was dropped on his head. Seventeen Israelis, including six soldiers, have been killed in violence since December 1987 when Palestinians began their uprising against the Israeli occupation. At least 386 Palestinians have been killed. The kidnap claim came in an anonymous call to the <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> news agency Agence France-Presse. A man who spoke Arabic said the <ORGANIZATION> Palestinian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> had kidnapped Sgt. <PERSON> Avi </PERSON> <PERSON> Sassportas </PERSON>, 21, and would detail its demands and release a videotape of the paratrooper later. The caller said his group was not affiliated with the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Sassportas </PERSON> disappeared Feb. 16, after leaving his base in southern <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to return to his home city of <LOCATION> Ashdod </LOCATION>. Army officials disclosed that a similar claim was made five days ago by the radical <ORGANIZATION> Marxist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> faction Democratic Front for the Liberation of <LOCATION> Palestine </LOCATION>. In clashes in the occupied lands Monday, nine people were wounded in the crowded <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> refugee camps of Shati and Jabaliya. One man was reported shot when troops opened fire to disperse a protest in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> town of <LOCATION> Halhoul </LOCATION>. In nearby <LOCATION> Bethlehem </LOCATION>, Palestinian youths went house to house warning residents to heed a strike ordered by the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Leadership </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Uprising </ORGANIZATION> and boycott <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s municipal elections Tuesday, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> reporters said. A warning written on a <LOCATION> Bethlehem </LOCATION> wall said: `` The strike forces will be watching for all those who will not observe the strike.'' The army announced the occupied lands will be closed off during the elections and that Palestinians will not be permitted to enter <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio said. Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> has called on Israelis to vote for his right-wing <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> bloc in the local elections as a sign that <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> rejects any dialogue with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>. Israeli newspapers reported the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> for the Liberation of <LOCATION> Palestine </LOCATION> issued a statement in <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>, saying it would not abide by <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s pledge to end attacks on Israeli targets on the Lebanese border. The Front will continue its `` just struggle against <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> occupation,'' the newspapers quoted the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> faction as saying. Israeli officials already charge that the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>'s renunciation of terrorism is an empty promise.

 Thousands of illegal aliens may have been shuttled across the country on a daily <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> flight from <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, an official said Monday after 79 people were apprehended. Agents of the <ORGANIZATION> Immigration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Naturalization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> apprehended the suspected illegal aliens shortly after Eastern Flight 80's arrival for a stopover at <ORGANIZATION> Hartsfield </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlanta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airport </ORGANIZATION> `` We believe this is one of the largest operations we've conducted that involves illegal aliens on board commercial aircraft here in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Fischer </PERSON>, district director of the <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> INS office `` This may be part of a massive alien smuggling operation,'' he said, adding that the <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> would continue to investigate. Investigators believe illegal aliens had been aboard the same Eastern flight nearly every day for the past 30 days, said <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> spokesman in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>. `` It appears at this point from our sources that it's almost a daily occurrence,'' he said. He estimated that thousands had been moved across the country on Eastern airliners. He said authorities did not know how they entered the country. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> said Eastern had cooperated fully in the investigation. `` We do n't in any way connect <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> and do n't want to intimate that they were even remotely involved at this point,'' <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> said. In <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Virginia </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanchez </PERSON> said: `` All I know is that the <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> had told us they'd be monitoring a flight this week and, of course, we cooperated with them.'' The suspected aliens taken off Monday's flight included 39 from <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, 22 from <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION>, 13 from the <LOCATION> Dominican </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>, three from <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> and one each from <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ecuador </LOCATION>. They were to be transferred to <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> processing centers in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> for deportations, <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> said some of the aliens paid smugglers up to $ 4,000 for a package deal, although authorities do n't know what that deal included other than air fare from <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` We do n't know if that was out of the country to get into the country ... to get set up in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>,'' he said, adding that the package could have included living arrangements, phony documents and a job. One-way coach tickets on the plane Monday cost from $ 433 to $ 577, including taxes, according to a travel agent. One alien was <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> La </PERSON> <PERSON> Cruz-Rodriguez </PERSON>, 34, who said he wanted to make money to send to his wife and three young sons in the <LOCATION> Dominican </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>. He told The <ORGANIZATION> Atlanta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION> that a smuggler in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> helped him and about a dozen others cross the border, then arranged to have them transported by flatbed truck to <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. He said he sold his truck to raise part of the money and gave the smuggler almost $ 1,000. He held up a quarter and said: `` That's all I have left.'' `` I always had the image of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> having a lot of money and a lot of wealth, and that I could find work without any problem,'' he said, adding that he will do whatever he can to stay here `` because if I go back, they'll put me in prison.

 Echoes of the 1988 presidential campaign reverberated at a meeting of the nation's governors Monday when former <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> nominee <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> challenged the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration's commitment to dealing with urban problems. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>, President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s new secretary of housing and urban development, gave the governors an enthusiastic presentation of his plans to attack poverty and homelessness and to help reinvigorate the nation's cities. When the former <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> congressman finished, the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor who was the 1988 Democratic presidential nominee said `` I applaud'' <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>'s goals. `` On the other hand,'' he went on, `` as I look over the president's budget there is a yawning gap between what you're saying and what's in there.'' <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>, who was one of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s rivals for the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> presidential nomination, cited federal budget problems but also pledged, `` I can assure you that I am going to do everything I can to make sure that there is adequate funding for those programs that work.'' The housing secretary also said, `` I'm going to be tenacious and, indeed, audacious in looking for programs that are not working as well, and where we can save some money.'' `` The budget does need some reworking,'' said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, who carried only 10 states in the November election. He cited the administration's proposal to cut back the <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Block </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Grant </ORGANIZATION> program, which he said local governments use to attract private investment in housing and other development projects. Attorney General <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> and <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s choice to lead the government's anti-drug efforts, also appeared before the governors, telling them the administration is committed to dealing with the drug problem `` To achieve what President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has expressed as a goal of a kinder and gentler <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, we're going to have to get rougher and tougher with some Americans,'' said <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON>. `` Those who are engaged in drug trafficking and drug-related violence are going to have to be focused on if we are going to have safer streets and safer communities.'' <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>, the former secretary of education, said, `` In some places the problem is nothing short of ferocious.'' But, he went on, `` we have seen a remarkable shift in public attitudes.'' That shift has shown that the public `` is very serious about this issue'' and prepared to accept strong measures to combat drugs, said <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Reilly </PERSON>, the new director of the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, told the governors that enforcement of environmental laws and regulations `` is at the heart of the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> mission. It gives vigor, effectiveness and vitality and reality to all else that we do. It will have our highest priority.'' On a matter of particular concern to governors who have nuclear weapons facilities in their states, <PERSON> Reilly </PERSON> said his agency would direct enforcement at governmental facilities as well as at private industry. He also told the governors that dealing with pollution `` is going to require changes, in habits, in lifestyle choices, from all households in the country eventually, I think.'' He cited programs under way in some communities that require people to separate waste to help in recycling. At a discussion on caring for children, the governors heard from a panel of teen-agers from <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION>. When Gov. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Clinton </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION> asked their views on how to reduce teen-age pregancies, two of the young people recommended more education while rejecting proposals for distributing birth control materials. Then <PERSON> Jerrold </PERSON> <PERSON> Culp </PERSON> from <ORGANIZATION> Lee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in <PERSON> Marianna </PERSON> drew laughter from the governors when he said, `` In my area I think we just need something else to do.'' On the problem of school dropouts, <PERSON> Courtney </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Sheridan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in <PERSON> Sheridan </PERSON> told the governors that `` schools need to be more personalized.'' `` Some students feel isolated; some students feel detached,'' she said. `` Students' lives have to be touched.''

<HEAD>Female Marine Captain Says She Wanted to Face Accusers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CAMP LEJEUNE, N.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> captain facing possible dismissal for associating with lesbians said Monday she wanted a court-martial instead of the board of inquiry that ruled against her. `` I wanted to see my accusers,'' Capt. <PERSON> Judy </PERSON> <PERSON> Meade </PERSON> said in a telephone interview. `` Instead -LRB- the prosecutor -RRB- put in statements. -LRB- The witnesses -RRB- made many statements but -LRB- prosecutors -RRB- just took what they wanted to put in.'' A board of five colonels recommended Sunday that Ms. <PERSON> Meade </PERSON> receive an `` other than honorable'' discharge after concluding that her association with lesbians constituted conduct unbecoming an officer. Ms. <PERSON> Meade </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> Vaughn </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>, criticized the proceedings during the five-day hearing last week, saying it did not allow for the defense to cross-examine witnesses. The board of inquiry differs from a court-martial in that five Marine officers hear the government's presentation and then rule. The board has a legal adviser available to them. Ms. <PERSON> Meade </PERSON> said she was not allowed to subpoena witnesses. Maj. <PERSON> Stuart </PERSON> <PERSON> Wagner </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Camp </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lejeune </LOCATION> spokesman, said there was n't enough evidence to have a court-martial for a criminal charge `` It is n't a crime -LRB- to associate with a lesbian -RRB- and this was not a criminal procedure,'' <PERSON> Wagner </PERSON> said. `` This was an administrative procedure ... akin to an employer deciding if an employee had further service. ... I think what was in question was her judgment and the effect that that judgment had with her personal relations and her Marine Corps relations.'' Professor <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Nakell </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carolina </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION>, a civil rights specialist, said he thought Ms. <PERSON> Meade </PERSON>'s choice of friends should be constitutionally protected by the right of freedom of association `` My position would be that as long as there is nothing about the ... friendships that would compromise security and there is nothing to show what her sexual preference is, it should be constitutionally protected,'' he said. But <PERSON> Wagner </PERSON> said a question of leadership was involved. `` I do n't think the question at any time was whether Capt. <PERSON> Meade </PERSON> was a homosexual,'' <PERSON> Wagner </PERSON> said. `` The question was whether her relationship and the consequences of that relationship affected her ability to be an effective <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> officer and remain in the <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> is a way of life.'' Ms. <PERSON> Meade </PERSON> said she hopes for an honorable discharge for her 12 years of service. The final decision will be made by the secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>. Ms. <PERSON> Meade </PERSON>, 36, a military police officer, said she is angry over the treatment she has received, but also said she would not criticize the corps. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> is a good organization. I'm never going to put the <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> down. It's not the organization, it's just some individuals in it,'' she said. Most of the allegations against Ms. <PERSON> Meade </PERSON> stemmed from a February 1988 visit she made to the home of <PERSON> Paula </PERSON> <PERSON> Berry </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Beaufort </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION> Government witnesses said they saw Ms. <PERSON> Meade </PERSON> in Ms. <PERSON> Berry </PERSON>'s bed with her then. Both Ms. <PERSON> Berry </PERSON> and Ms. <PERSON> Meade </PERSON> acknowledged during the hearing that Ms. <PERSON> Berry </PERSON> is a lesbian, but denied that the two ever had sexual contact. Ms. <PERSON> Berry </PERSON> said they slept in the same bed once when Ms. <PERSON> Meade </PERSON> fell asleep watching television. The board also said Ms. <PERSON> Meade </PERSON> had failed to report suspected lesbian activity, and had misled her superior officers by withholding information that Ms. <PERSON> Berry </PERSON> was a lesbian. It also said Ms. <PERSON> Meade </PERSON> frequented a bar which was `` known by her to have a questionable reputation.'' Ms. <PERSON> Meade </PERSON> said she plans to pursue a career in security or law enforcement.

 A woman who was arrested after she was found wandering around the home of television talk show host <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Letterman </PERSON> was released Monday. <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Ray </PERSON>, 36, was released on her own recognizance at an arraignment hearing in <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. But Judge <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Levitt </PERSON> also suggested that <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> re-enroll in the psychiatric program at <LOCATION> Fairfield </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>. She had been released from the state hospital last fall. <PERSON> Ray </PERSON>, who was caught driving <PERSON> Letterman </PERSON>'s car and breaking into his house last year, was arrested again Friday night when she was found wandering around the foyer of his home in southwestern <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>, police said. She was charged with one felony count of first-degree trespass and one misdemeanor count each of possession of marijuana and possession of drug paraphernalia, police said. <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> was scheduled for another court appearance Friday to enter a plea, according to her attorney, <PERSON> Anita </PERSON> <PERSON> Cason </PERSON>. On May 22, 1988, <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> was arrested on the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> side of the <LOCATION> Lincoln </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Tunnel </LOCATION> as she was driving into <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> in <PERSON> Letterman </PERSON>'s 1988 Porsche with her 3-year-old son. The toll collector thought it was suspicious that a woman driving an $ 80,000 automobile did not have the $ 3 toll. Police said <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> identified herself as <PERSON> Letterman </PERSON>'s wife and introduced her son as <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Letterman </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>. After the incident, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canaan </LOCATION> police discovered that someone had broken a living room window to enter <PERSON> Letterman </PERSON>'s three-bedroom home Police said <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> apparently had moved into the house with her son and lived there for a couple of days while <PERSON> Letterman </PERSON> was out of town. Although <PERSON> Letterman </PERSON> refused to press charges against <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> for the first incident, <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> was arrested by <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canaan </LOCATION> police three days later after she took a taxi to <PERSON> Letterman </PERSON>'s house. In September, <PERSON> Levitt </PERSON> ordered <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> to give up contact with <PERSON> Letterman </PERSON> except through the mail and to remain at <LOCATION> Fairfield </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION>, where she had been undergoing psychiatric treatment since August 1988.

 The Philippine government on Monday sold for $ 3.7 million a <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> condominium said to have been purchased by then-President <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> with money looted from his nation's treasury It was the second piece of Marcos-linked real estate in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> sold by the <ORGANIZATION> Philippine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> on Good Government. The first, a house in <LOCATION> Princeton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, was sold in 1987 for $ 1 million. <PERSON> Teresa </PERSON> <PERSON> Roxas </PERSON>, a commission official, said the seven-bedroom apartment on the 43rd floor of the Olympic Towers, a glass tower next to <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Patricks </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cathedral </ORGANIZATION> on Fifth Avenue, was purchased for $ 3.675 million as a home for a buyer who asked not to be identified. The apartment was surrendered to the <LOCATION> Philippine </LOCATION> government in 1986 by a <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> associate, <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Floirendo </PERSON>, as part of a deal to avoid prosecution. It was among several properties allegedly owned by <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> through fronts. <PERSON> Roxas </PERSON> said two other such residences are on the market _ Lindenmere, an estate on <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, with an asking price of $ 4.5 million, and a home in <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION>, for $ 2.5 million. The commission is fighting in court to gain title to four commercial buildings in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> that are worth an estimated $ 400 million. The <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> holdings allegedly were purchased with some of the $ 10 billion that the <LOCATION> Philippine </LOCATION> government alleges <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> and his associates embezzled before he was ousted and fled to <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> in 1986. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' wife, <PERSON> Imelda </PERSON>, has pleaded innocent in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> to federal racketeering charges and is free on $ 5 million bail.

<HEAD>Guidelines Issued by FDA</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The Food and Drug Administration on Monday issued standards for expectorants in nonprescription cough-cold medicines that allow only one proven active ingredient to remain on the market. <PERSON> Guaifenesin </PERSON> was the only ingredient found by the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> to be safe and effective in increasing sputum or phlegm volume and making it easier to cough up. It is the most wiely used active ingredient used in expectorants and is contained in the major brands of cough-cold medicines, the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> said. About 20 other expectorant ingredients were found not to be useful and products using these ingredients will have to be reformulated or taken off the market within one year. The <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> said eight products listed in the <ORGANIZATION> Handbook </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nonprescription </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drugs </ORGANIZATION> would fall into this category. Among the 20 ingredients are ammonium chloride, a plant extract called horehound, pine tar, spirits of turpentine and squill, the dried inner scales of a flowering plant. The <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> standards were developed as part of a review of all nonprescription drugs that began in 1972. The standards will let expectorant products using guaifenesin claim on their labels that they `` help loosen phlegm -LRB- sputum -RRB- and thin bronchial secretions to rid the bronchial passageways of bothersome mucus, drain bronchial tubes and make coughs more productive.'' However, the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> said these products will not be able to claim that they `` relieve irritated membranes in the respiratory passageways by preventing dryness through increased mucus flow.'' This claim was not supported by studies, the agency said. Labels for expectorant products must contain two warnings, the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> said. _ Do not take this product for persistent or chronic cough such as occurs with smoking, asthma, chronic bronchitis or emphysema, or where cough is accompanied by excessive phlegm unless directed by a doctor _ A persistent cough may be a sign of a serious condition If cough persists for more than one week, tends to recur, or is accompanied by fever, rash or persistent headache, consult a doctor.''

<TEXT>
 Dr. <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>, apparently heading for confirmation as health and human services secretary, repeated his opposition to abortion and fielded a broad range of questions on other topics from a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> committee Monday. The abortion issue, which has dogged the <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> doctor since his nomination was announced, got only brief mention at the hearing before the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, as it did before the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> last week. In his opening statement, <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> said that `` abortion is wrong and that it is inconsistent with the best of family values.'' He said that, like President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, he opposes abortion except in cases of rape, incest or danger to the life of a mother, and is against federal funding of abortions except to save a mother's life. Later, Sen. <PERSON> Orrin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hatch </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Utah </LOCATION>, asked <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> to restate his views on abortion, which the doctor did, adding that he has never performed the procedure. In response to subsequent questions from <PERSON> Hatch </PERSON>, <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> also said he would welcome a <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> decision overturning its 1973 ruling that legalized abortion. He said he supported the <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s position that family planning funds should not be used for abortions. <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>, however, again sidestepped the question of whether the federal government should pay for research that uses tissue from aborted fetuses. He said he would not state a position on the issue until he had read the recommendations of an advisory committee. <PERSON> Hatch </PERSON>, a fervent opponent of abortion, said he was satisfied with <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>'s views and fully supported his nomination. The <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> last week recommended full <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> approval of <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>'s nomination on a 19-0 vote, and Sen. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, D-Mass., chairman of the labor committee, predicted a unanimous <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> vote for <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> on Tuesday Both committees have jurisdiction over department programs, but the <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> is the panel that recommends action on the nomination to the full <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>'s committee will not vote separately on the nomination. His committee covered much of the same ground that the <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> did, devoting little time to abortion, the issue that has caused <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> the most problems. Last week, he apologized to Sen. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Packwood </PERSON>, R-Ore., saying he `` misspoke'' in private remarks on the subject He was quoted earlier in an interview with The <ORGANIZATION> Atlanta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Constitution </ORGANIZATION> as supporting a woman's right to abortion. On Monday, senators focused more attention on President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s fiscal 1990 budget proposal that would trim anticipated <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> spending by $ 5 billion and the effects of soaring medical costs on the federal budget

<HEAD>Lawmaker Clarifies Statement On Minimum Wage, Admits It Was `Terrible'</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 State Rep. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Clymer </PERSON> admitted Monday he reached `` the wrong conclusions'' when he suggested <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>'s minimum wage was adequate because minorities, slow learners and students take home the paychecks But some black legislators labeled <PERSON> Clymer </PERSON>'s remarks `` racist'' and rooted in `` a slave mentality.'' `` It's sad, really sad,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Hardy </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, a black Democrat from <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>. `` His reasoning has no place in our society. What he's saying is that he wants to underpay a whole class of society.'' <PERSON> Clymer </PERSON>, a five-term Republican from a largely rural, predominantly white district in <LOCATION> Bucks </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, made the statements about lower-wage earners in a survey of state lawmakers by The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. Answering a question about the state's $ 3.70 hourly minimum wage, which was boosted 35 cents in February, he responded: `` The 35-cent increase is adequate. Remember, the people earning minimum wage are minorities, slow learners, students and part-time employees.'' <PERSON> Clymer </PERSON> went on to say that the federal government should be setting the minimum wage, and that any further increases at the state level would send a negative signal to business. In an interview Monday, <PERSON> Clymer </PERSON> admitted his statements appeared `` terrible,'' but he denied that any malice was involved. `` I just did n't put it right,'' he said. `` I thought it through, but the conclusions I wanted to draw were not there. They were the wrong conclusions. It's unfortunate I did not take more time; what I should have done is take more time.'' <PERSON> Clymer </PERSON> said he had been trying to explain that the minimum wage sometimes provides the only employment opportunities for workers in areas with high unemployment or where jobs are scarce. The minimum wage `` would give them a chance. This does n't mean that they should n't be making more money,'' he said. <PERSON> Clymer </PERSON> stopped short of apologizing for the remarks, saying he meant no harm and had simply misstated his position. But <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said the remarks showed `` a slave mentality'' and were `` very racist.''

 The <ORGANIZATION> Pratt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Whitney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Division </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technologies </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> on Monday won the largest share of the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>'s fiscal 1990 jet engine business, beating out the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> for the third straight year. The <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>, in a brief announcement, said <ORGANIZATION> Pratt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Whitney </PERSON> would be asked to build 64 percent of the basic jet engines now used in its fighters during the year starting next Oct. 1, while <ORGANIZATION> GE </ORGANIZATION> would produce the remaining 36 percent. The service said it planned to acquire 109 of those engines during fiscal 1990. The 64-36 split would give <ORGANIZATION> Pratt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Whitney </ORGANIZATION> 70 of those engines and <ORGANIZATION> GE </ORGANIZATION> 39. And in another major coup for <ORGANIZATION> Pratt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Whitney </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> said it would split its first buy of new `` increased performance'' engines for the 1990s by a 56-to-44 percent margin in favor of <PERSON> Pratt </PERSON>. Current plans call for the purchase of 122 of the more powerful engines in fiscal 1990. Sixty-eight of them will be purchased from <ORGANIZATION> Pratt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Whitney </PERSON> and the remaining 54 will come from <ORGANIZATION> GE </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> said. All told, <ORGANIZATION> Pratt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Whitney </PERSON> will build 138 basic and increased performance engines in fiscal 1990, while <ORGANIZATION> GE </ORGANIZATION> will build 93 of its basic and increased performance engines. The <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> said it would award the final contracts for the basic engines being purchased in fiscal 1990 soon. Until that happens, however, the service declined to estimate their values. The contracts for the increased performance engines, though, were awarded Monday. They total $ 146.4 million to <ORGANIZATION> Pratt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <LOCATION> Whitney </LOCATION> and $ 126.8 million to <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> launched what has been called the `` great engine war'' in 1983 when it decided to stage annual competitions for the right to supply engines for its two front-line fighters, the F-15 Eagle and the F-16 Fighting Falcon. Until that point, <ORGANIZATION> Pratt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Whitney </PERSON> held a monopoly on providing the high-performance engines. During the first round of the competition, <ORGANIZATION> GE </ORGANIZATION> shattered <ORGANIZATION> Pratt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Whitney </PERSON>'s monopoly by winning the right to produce 75 percent of the engines in fiscal 1985. <ORGANIZATION> Pratt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <LOCATION> Whitney </LOCATION> rebounded in fiscal 1986 by winning 46 percent of the total, but <ORGANIZATION> GE </ORGANIZATION> still won the majority of the business. GE then managed to increase slightly its share of the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>'s business for fiscal 1987 by winning 56 percent of the award to <ORGANIZATION> Pratt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Whitney </PERSON>'s 44 percent But <ORGANIZATION> Pratt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Whitney </PERSON> finally reclaimed the top spot in fiscal 1988, winning 55 percent of the business compared to <ORGANIZATION> GE </ORGANIZATION>'s 45 percent, and then held on to win the same percentage split in 1989. The <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> has described the competition as producing lower bid prices and much-improved warranties from the two manufacturers. With the fiscal 1990 split included, <ORGANIZATION> GE </ORGANIZATION> has now won contracts to produce 833 of its basic F110 engines, while <ORGANIZATION> Pratt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Whitney </PERSON> has won contracts to manufacture 768 of its F-100-220 engines. If the split is included for the new increased performance engines, <ORGANIZATION> GE </ORGANIZATION> has won awards for a total 887 engines and <ORGANIZATION> Pratt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Whitney 836. The F-15 and F-16 are the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>'s top-line fighters and are made by <ORGANIZATION> McDonnell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dynamics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, respectively.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Salman </PERSON> <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> is a `` heretic and a renegade'' who blasphemed Islam in his novel `` The Satanic Verses,'' Moslem theologians said Monday, but they did not endorse <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s decree that he be killed After a conference in <LOCATION> Mecca </LOCATION> sponsored by the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Moslem </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION>, the theologians said the British author, born in <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> to Moslem parents, and his publishers should be tried by `` relevant courts.'' <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> was not represented at the meeting. <PERSON> Abdullah </PERSON> <PERSON> Naseef </PERSON>, secretary-general of the league, issued a conference statement urging the 46-member <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> to pursue that goal and to boycott publishing houses that promote the book. The statement, distributed by the official <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> news agency, said <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>'s public apology was insufficient. It said he must confess that what he wrote about <ORGANIZATION> Islam </ORGANIZATION>, the prophet <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> and his wives, and the prophet <PERSON> Abraham </PERSON> was `` pure lies and fabrication.'' Diplomatic sources said privately it would be left to the <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> to seek a trial either in the British courts or in absentia in an Islamic country. <ORGANIZATION> Al-Sharq </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> al-Awsat </ORGANIZATION>, a Saudi daily, said Wednesday that the meeting in <LOCATION> Mecca </LOCATION>, the holy city of <LOCATION> Islam </LOCATION>, would demand <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> be tried in an Islamic state and would ask the conference to start legal proceedings in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. Islamic law condemns heretics to death, but only after they are tried and refuse to repent. The conference at the World Moslem League headquarters in <LOCATION> Mecca </LOCATION> ended Sunday with a brief statement naming several theological issues debated. It said `` The Satanic Verses'' was discussed and relevant recommendations would be made to Islamic states. <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>'s supreme theologian, <PERSON> Sheik </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdel-Aziz </PERSON> <PERSON> bin </PERSON> <PERSON> Baz </PERSON>, was chairman of the conference. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> is a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION>, whose annual meeting of foreign ministers is scheduled for March 13-16 in <LOCATION> Riyadh </LOCATION>. The conference has demanded that member nations prevent circulation of the book, ban newspapers and magazines from carrying excerpts, and blacklist the publishers.

<TEXT>
 The doctor whose opinion on the health of <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tower </PERSON>'s liver has become a key to the defense secretary-designate's last-ditch effort to rescue his nomination said he did n't know how the information would be used Dr. <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> <PERSON> Lichliter </PERSON>, who is not Tower's primary physician, said he was unaware until notified by reporters Sunday that the opinion had become a weapon in Tower's new offensive for the post. Tower, on <ORGANIZATION> ABC-TV </ORGANIZATION>'s `` This Week with <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Brinkley </PERSON>'' and <ORGANIZATION> CNN </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Newsmaker Sunday,'' launched a campaign Sunday to overcome last week's 11-9 rejection by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> when his appointment comes before the full <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> On both shows, Tower read portions of a letter from <LOCATION> Lichliter </LOCATION>, who is on the staff of <ORGANIZATION> Baylor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> here, saying that an examination after Tower's recent colon surgery showed `` no evidence at all of alcoholic impairment or alcoholism.'' Tower then issued a pledge to swear off alcohol if he is approved as defense secretary. <PERSON> Lichliter </PERSON> said he did n't see the shows. `` I'm just finding out about all this,'' he told the <ORGANIZATION> Dallas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Lichliter </PERSON> said he prepared the statement only because Dr. R.D. <PERSON> Dignan </PERSON>, who removed a benign lump from Tower's colon in January, was out of town when <ORGANIZATION> Tower </ORGANIZATION>'s staff called, asking for the letter to be sent by facsimile machine. <PERSON> Lichliter </PERSON> said he routinely takes calls in <PERSON> Dignan </PERSON>'s absence. <PERSON> Dignan </PERSON>, Tower's primary physician, released a statement earlier this month saying tests `` indicated no abnormalities within organ systems that might be involved with alcohol abuse.'' <PERSON> Lichliter </PERSON> said he spoke Sunday with <PERSON> Dignan </PERSON> about his letter, and said <PERSON> Dignan </PERSON> backed it `` 100 percent.'' Phone calls to both doctors' offices Monday were referred to <ORGANIZATION> Baylor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Habgood </PERSON>, who said neither Lichliter nor <PERSON> Dignan </PERSON> would have any further comment. `` Both have indicated that their previous statements stand as is,'' <PERSON> Habgood </PERSON> said.

 Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> ended a visit to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> on Monday that he said forged closer relations despite `` ideological differences.'' <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>'s official <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> reported that <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> also said in meetings with President <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Khamenei </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hashemi </PERSON> <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> speaker, that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> naval forces should withdraw from the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> was the highest Soviet official to visit <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> since <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>'s fundamentalist Islamic revolution overthrew the late <PERSON> Shah </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Reza </PERSON> <PERSON> Pahlavi </PERSON> in February 1979. `` We believe relations between <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> have been substantially transformed,'' he said before leaving for <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> renewed an invitation to <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> to visit <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> and the speaker accepted. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION>, the official Soviet news agency, said the two governments can `` constructively cooperate'' on many international problems. With <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> confronting the West over <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>'s order that <PERSON> Salman </PERSON> <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> be killed for his novel `` The Satanic Verses,'' which many Moslems say blasphemes Islam, Soviet-Iranian relations are at their best since the revolution. <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> and <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> met Sunday, but Iranian reports indicated they did not discuss the <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> controversy despite <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s request to the Soviet foreign minister that he bring it up. After meeting <PERSON> Khamanei </PERSON> on Monday, <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> conferred with Foreign Minister <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Akbar </PERSON> <PERSON> Velayati </PERSON> and signed political and cultural agreements, <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION> reported. The agreements underscored `` new horizons in political ties between <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> was quoted as saying. His success in bolstering Soviet-Iranian relations climaxed a 10-day, five-nation <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> tour aimed at widening the Soviet role in a region that has long been considered a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> preserve. <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION> did not quote <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> as saying what differences remain between <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, but the communist bloc's state atheism is anathema to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s fundamentalist Moslem leaders. The Soviets were the main arms suppliers to <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> during the war with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. Many Iranian leaders, while prepared to bolster ties with the Soviets, remain wary of their giant northern neighbor who briefly occupied part of their country after World War II. The Soviet withdrawal from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s eastern Islamic neighbor, has eliminated a major source of friction. `` We have come to the conclusion that it is a must to acknowledge others' beliefs and respect them,'' <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> said. `` In our opinion, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> enjoys high international prestige.'' He said the Soviets would push for progress in the <LOCATION> Iran-Iraq </LOCATION> peace talks, which have been stalled since the Aug. 20 cease-fire. <PERSON> Khamenei </PERSON> called on the Soviets to pressure <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> to stop its alleged stalling in the negotiations so that a peace treaty can be signed. <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> reiterated his call in <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION> for the withdrawal of foreign forces from the gulf. He had said in <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION> that <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> was willing to withdraw its ships. `` We have explicitly announced to the American president that we condemn the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military presence in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>, and will continue this policy until the Americans withdraw their troops from the region,'' he said. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has 23 warships in and around the gulf. The Soviets have seven to nine. Most European warships have left. The major powers either sent warships into the gulf or increased their naval squadrons to protect merchant ships from Iranian attacks launched in retaliation for Iraqi air raids. <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION> said that <PERSON> Khamenei </PERSON> told <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> that `` <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> must be pressured'' to break the deadlock in the peace talks, `` and we think your government can exert this pressure more than anyone else.'' The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has a friendship treaty with <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION> and is believed to be one of its largest creditors. <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> radio broadcast excerpts of the meeting between <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> and <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> was the first foreign official to talk to <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> at his home. <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> seldom meets foreign dignitaries, and it was the first he had been heard speaking publicly in months. <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> agreed to meet <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> because he wanted to hear a response to a message he sent to Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> in January. <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> said <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>'s message, praising <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s reforms and urging him to accept <ORGANIZATION> Islam </ORGANIZATION>, had received a `` good response'' from <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> leaders who read it, although they did not agree with all of it <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> stressed the importance of `` the expansion of strong ties in various dimensions in confronting the devilish acts of the West,'' <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> radio said. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Majlis </ORGANIZATION>, or parliament, votes Tuesday on a bill to sever relations with <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> for publishing `` The Satanic Verses'' and leading European nations in recalling their senior diplomats from <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> to protest the <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>'s `` kill <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>'' religious decree. <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> newspapers Monday supported severing ties. <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION> quoted <PERSON> Qorban-Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Saleh-Abadi </PERSON>, a member of parliament, as predicting relations will be broken off. `` God willing, we will approve this bill tomorrow,'' he said. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> recalled its diplomats from <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> and asked <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s to leave <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> after <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> issued his execution order Feb. 14. Fourteen other Western nations have withdrawn their top diplomats from <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> in the furor over <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>'s death sentence.

<HEAD>FCC Eases Requirements for Phone-Installation Help</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The government on Monday said low-income applicants for subsidized telephone service no longer will have to show they've had no phone for the previous three months or that they've received no federal phone aid for two years. The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> said those requirements for `` Link Up <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'' aid were denying service to 15 percent of all applicants. The year-old federal assistance plan is designed to encourage low-income households to obtain telephone service by helping pay for installation. Qualifying households may receive up to $ 30 to help defray such costs. <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Brock </PERSON>, chief of the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION>'s common carrier bureau, said there were 385,000 people in 37 states, the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION> in the program. <PERSON> Brock </PERSON> said the commission decided to loosen the requirements when it was shown it would not cost the government very much. `` We are finding that it has been an effective program but it has not been so well used that the financial requirements were overwhelming,'' <PERSON> Brock </PERSON> told reporters. `` That's one of the reasons why we put more restrictions on at the beginning.'' In another action Monday, the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> ruled that radio equipment used to provide phone service to remote areas will be considered as belonging to the telephone companies, and consumers will not have to buy it. The commission made its ruling on a petition filed by the <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> consulting firm of <ORGANIZATION> Tallon </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cheeseman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION> regarding the <ORGANIZATION> Basic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telecommunications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. The commission said the antenna and radio equipment located on or near the premises of users of the service should be treated as regulated network equipment and is eligible for federal and state programs designed to assist telephone companies that provide service in high-cost areas. The company estimated the cost of this equipment to range from $ 2,200 to $ 2,400, the commission said. The ruling means the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> will increase the federal assistance available to rural phone companies and their customers to install such equipment, and the users will pay the same basic service charges as regular phone users in the area.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> will not call a halt to the uprising on the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> before <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> agrees to negotiate, a group of scholars who met recently with <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> said Monday. The 15-month uprising could be `` notched up a bit or notched down'' as part of the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>'s strategy for drawing <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> into negotiations, former <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> official <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Quandt </PERSON> said. However, recounting recent talks in <LOCATION> Tunis </LOCATION> with <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> and other <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> officials, <PERSON> Quandt </PERSON> said they did not offer to call off the `` intefadeh,'' in which 386 Palestinian Arabs and 17 Israelis have died, if <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> yielded. <PERSON> Quandt </PERSON>, who was an analyst on the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, was accompanied to <LOCATION> Tunis </LOCATION> for the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> meetings by former Assistant Secretary of State <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Saunders </PERSON> and <PERSON> Helena </PERSON> <PERSON> Cobban </PERSON>, a scholar. They are now at the <ORGANIZATION> Brookings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institution </ORGANIZATION>, a private research group. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> has refused to negotiate with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>, accusing it of terrorism and citing a provision in the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> covenant calling for the destruction of the Jewish state. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> last December opened talks with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>. However, <PERSON> Quandt </PERSON> said the talks had fallen short of <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> expectations and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> promises. He said he found <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> and other <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> officials `` a bit frustrated and disappointed with the virtual non-existence of the U.S.-PLO dialogue.'' The former <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> administration official added: `` They had been promised at the time the dialogue began there would be substantive talks. There have been virtually none.'' Asked about <PERSON> Quandt </PERSON>'s account, <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Redman </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, said he `` could n't speak to someone else's expectations. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official said the government decision to talk to the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> `` was made at the end of the previous administration, and we're now in the early stages of a new administration. But beyond that, I do n't really have any way to interpret somebody else's expectations. On a related subject, <PERSON> Saunders </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> envisioned a two-state solution to its dispute with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, with no <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> Wall or barbed wires in between. `` Amyone who commits a terrorist act against <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> would be punished,'' <PERSON> Saunders </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> leaders told the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> delegation they had hoped in the past to create a single secular state, <PERSON> Saunders </PERSON> said. But they said in <LOCATION> Tunis </LOCATION> `` we are transformed'' and are prepared to live in permanent peace alongside <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, he said. <PERSON> Saunders </PERSON> said <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> envisioned open borders and full diplomatic relations with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, plus economic relations with <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON> as well.

 The SR-71 Blackbird, a futuristic-looking spy plane whose speed records have never been broken and which can photograph a license plate from 17 miles up, will retire after nearly 25 years of service, the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> said Monday. The black, twin-engine jet was the original stealth aircraft and was never armed because it can easily outrace enemy missiles and fighters, <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> officials said. Exact figures are classified, but the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> reportedly will save up to $ 300 million a year by retiring the SR-71 squadron on Oct. 1. Defense budget priorities are forcing the SR-71 fleet into mothballs and satellites will take over its duties, a <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said. `` We will rely on existing reconnaissance capabilities, which I ca n't be real specific about, but you can assume that it is mainly satellite capability,'' <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> Lt. Col. <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Purka </PERSON> said in a telephone interview. Although still largely shrouded in secrecy, some details of the elusive photo reconnaissance plane have been made public and it was even featured in a 1984-85 television series, `` Call to Glory,'' about an <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> family. Despite its age _ the first one was delivered in 1966 _ it still holds world records for jet-powered speed and altitude, set in 1976 with a speed of 2,193 mph and an altitude of 85,000 feet. In September 1974, a Blackbird flew from <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> in 3 hours, 47 minutes, or, taking into account the time zones it crossed, four hours before it left. <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> pilot Lt. Col. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Orcutt </PERSON> says the jet carries considerable mystique despite its vintage. `` It looks like something from outer space,'' <PERSON> Orcutt </PERSON> said recently. `` The SR-71 excites the boy in all of us who love to fly.'' At peak altitude, pilots can view the curvature of the <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>, and when they look straight up they see the blackness of space. The Blackbird's speed of more than 2,000 mph is three times the speed of sound, or 33 miles a minute, faster than a rifle bullet. It can survey 100 square miles an hour, he said. The <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> tried to retire the Blackbird squadron last year, but was overruled by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee staffer <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Waters </PERSON> said no such move has been made in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> so far, but could n't predict whether <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> would fight the planned retirement. `` It's a very costly system to operate, but there are people, both in the military and in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, that want to keep it around,'' Waters said. Nine or 10 <ORGANIZATION> Blackbirds </ORGANIZATION> reportedly remain from the original lot of about 30. The SR-71 squadron is headquartered at <ORGANIZATION> Beale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> Base near <LOCATION> Marysville </LOCATION> in northern <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. Its support facilities are at <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Plant </ORGANIZATION> 42, about 50 miles north of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Palmdale </LOCATION>. Plant 42 is the site of the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>'s stealth research and development, which began with Blackbird's sleek design and radar-evading capabilities, officials said. The supersecret plane built by <ORGANIZATION> Lockheed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> as a successor to the U-2 was officially acknowledged by then-President <PERSON> Lyndon </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> on July 24, 1964. Development began in February 1963, and the first model was delivered in January 1966, <PERSON> Purka </PERSON> said. Operated under the <ORGANIZATION> Strategic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION>, the SR-71s also operate out of bases in <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, said <ORGANIZATION> SAC </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman Maj. <PERSON> Suzanne </PERSON> <PERSON> Randall </PERSON>.

 Troops and tanks moved into <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION> province Monday, while ethnic Albanian miners ended their eight-day sit-in deep in a mineshaft after three provincial <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> party leaders resigned as the strikers demanded. However, the miners said they would not work until their other demands were met, including the abandonment of planned constitutional changes that would give <LOCATION> Serbia </LOCATION> more control over the province. At another mine, workers from the province's Slavic minority began a strike in support of the party officials. The official <ORGANIZATION> Tanjug </ORGANIZATION> news agency said the government put emergency measures into effect immediately in <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION>, an autonomous province of the Serbian republic, but did not describe them. Air force jets flew over the provincial capital <LOCATION> Pristina </LOCATION> several times in a show of might by the federal government, which is trying to end a wave of protests by ethnic Albanians in <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION> that began with the miners' strike. Tanks were parked in front of the army barracks. Military vehicles loaded with soldiers headed toward <LOCATION> Titova </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mitrovica </LOCATION>, where the miners were occupying the <ORGANIZATION> Trepca </ORGANIZATION> lead and zinc mine. The miners began leaving the mine after the resignations of the three officials, who are ethnic Albanians but are seen as supporters of the Serbian Communist party. The state <ORGANIZATION> Tanjug </ORGANIZATION> news agency said that `` the first of the 1,300 ethnic Albanian miners were taken out of the mine shaft on stretchers'' at about 21:30 local time -LRB- 3 p.m. EST -RRB- and that the others followed. <LOCATION> Belgrade </LOCATION> television showed a film clip with weakened miners coming out of the pit leaning on each other and supported by medical staff who shielded their eyes from the TV light. <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION> is adjacent to <LOCATION> Albania </LOCATION> and its population of 1.8 million is 90 percent ethnic <PERSON> Albanian </PERSON>. Minority Slavs often complain of discrimination in the province and martial law was imposed briefly in 1981 after bloody riots between ethnic Albanians and security forces. <PERSON> Rahman </PERSON> <PERSON> Morina </PERSON>, the provincial party chief, resigned Monday and <LOCATION> Belgrade </LOCATION> radio quoted him as saying, in a comment directed at the <ORGANIZATION> Trepca </ORGANIZATION> miners: `` I am deeply shaken that you consider me responsible for your lives and health. It is only for this reason that I am submitting the resignation.'' <PERSON> Husamedin </PERSON> <PERSON> Azemi </PERSON>, party chief of <LOCATION> Pristina </LOCATION>, cited `` moral considerations and ... blackmail'' for resigning. Serb and Montenegrin members of the <LOCATION> Pristina </LOCATION> party leadership threatened to quit if <PERSON> Azemi </PERSON> left his post. <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Sukrija </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION>'s member in the country's policy-setting <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, also stepped down. At another lead and zinc mine, 800 members of <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION>'s Slavic minority occupied their pits and said they would continue the strike if the three leaders resigned. <ORGANIZATION> Tanjug </ORGANIZATION> said thousands of Slavs staged protest meetings in different regions of <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION> Monday to protest the resignations. Some 100,000 Slovenians and ethnic Albanians in <LOCATION> Slovenia </LOCATION>, the most developed and liberal Yugoslav republic, signed a petition protesting the introduction of emergency measures in <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Tanjug </ORGANIZATION> said. About 300 ethnic Albanians marched in the Slovenian capital of <LOCATION> Ljubljana </LOCATION> in support of the <ORGANIZATION> Trepca </ORGANIZATION> miners, <LOCATION> Belgrade </LOCATION> radio reported. On Saturday, the nine-member federal presidency ordered tighter internal security in <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION>. More soldiers and police than usual were on <LOCATION> Pristina </LOCATION>'s streets Monday, many guarding official buildings and army installations. The national <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leadership appealed to the <ORGANIZATION> Trepca </ORGANIZATION> miners to end the strike and cooperate in `` urgent, open, democratic consideration'' of their demands. Many stores, schools and universities in the province closed in sympathy strikes, but several ethnic Albanian merchants were seen opening their stores Monday afternoon. In <LOCATION> Slovenia </LOCATION>, the legislature called for an immediate session of the national parliament to consider the <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION> situation. <LOCATION> Slovenia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Croatia </LOCATION> oppose attempts by <PERSON> Slobodan </PERSON> <PERSON> Milosevic </PERSON>, the ambitious leader of <LOCATION> Serbia </LOCATION>'s League of Communists, or Communist party, to gain more control over <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Vojvodina </LOCATION>, another autonomous province in the republic.

<DATELINE>BATON ROUGE, La. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The governor and a former <PERSON> Ku </PERSON> <PERSON> Klux </PERSON> Klan grand wizard recently elected to the state legislature locked horns Monday over setting aside some state highway contracts for black-owned companies. `` We have a very clear process of racial discrimination going on in this bill,'' Rep. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Duke </PERSON> said during an appearance before the House Appropriations Committee. Gov. <PERSON> Buddy </PERSON> <PERSON> Roemer </PERSON>, also making an appearance before the committee, said he did not believe the minority set-asides would be a permanent fixture in awarding highway contracts. `` They are only a transition,'' the Democrat said. <PERSON> Duke </PERSON>, a Republican from suburban <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>, was elected to the state legislature Feb. 18 after a heated campaign in which he drew opposition from President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, former President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, and most of the area's political elite. He is not a member of the appropriations panel. Like the governor, he appeared to testify about the set-aside programs. For <PERSON> Duke </PERSON>, it was one of the first opportunities to address a campaign pledge to oppose special treatment for blacks. The committee voted 12-3 against <PERSON> Duke </PERSON> and for the governor, sending the bill to the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> floor for debate. Under set-asides, a portion of government contracts are reserved for minority-owned companies as a remedy for past discrimination. <PERSON> Roemer </PERSON>, who wants a $ 1.5 billion program for highways, airports and ports financed by an additional 4-cent tax on gasoline, said the bill would `` make sure the entire state moves together in economic development.'' The governor said his administration wanted to limit such programs to 10 percent of the total. But <PERSON> Duke </PERSON>, elected after campaigning against set-aside programs, said the bill would discriminate against white contractors. He claimed <PERSON> Roemer </PERSON>'s transportation program could cost up to $ 200 million more if set-aside programs were used, he said. <PERSON> Duke </PERSON>, a 38-year-old Republican from suburban <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>, quit the <ORGANIZATION> Klan </ORGANIZATION> in 1980 in a leadership dispute, and set up his own organization, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> for the Advancement of White People. Rep. <PERSON> Sherman </PERSON> <PERSON> Copelin </PERSON>, a black Democrat from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>, said the bill had been drawn with the help of the Associated General Contractors, the state's largest contracting group. According to the bill, the governor would be required to have a study committee determine whether black contractors have been discriminated against. The Legislature would be in charge of drawing up guidelines for the set-aside program if the study found discrimination. If lawmakers did not act by June 30, <PERSON> Roemer </PERSON> could impose guidelines by executive order. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> earlier this year struck down a <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, plan to set aside 30 percent of the value of public works projects for companies at least half-owned by minorities because the city could not prove minority contractors were being discriminated against.

<HEAD>NASA Heat Sensors Find Buried Spanish Mission</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BLAND, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Archaeologists have begun unearthing the remains of a 17th-century Spanish mission that they located in a pasture with the help of an airborne heat sensor developed by <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION>. `` It's fantastic,'' says <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Milanich </PERSON>, curator in archaeology at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Museum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Natural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> History </ORGANIZATION>. `` I never saw anything so magical in my life,'' he said of the computer-generated map that revealed the outlines of what little is left of the <ORGANIZATION> Mission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Santa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> de </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Toloco </ORGANIZATION>. In the past few weeks, teams headed by <PERSON> Milanich </PERSON> have unearthed what they are convinced are the outlines of the mission's three main buildings: the kitchen, the priests' residence and the church. They also have found the mission's cemetery. These relics have been hidden since 1702, when British soldiers and their Indian allies burned and looted the century-old <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fe </LOCATION> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Toloco </PERSON>. Soon, ruins were plowed into the soil or covered by natural soil buildup. On Christmas Eve 1986, a field crew headed by graduate student <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> stumbled across pottery, spikes and clay near the <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fe </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Alachua </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, north of the school's campus in <LOCATION> Gainesville </LOCATION>. Using Spanish documents, they were able to narrow the location of <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fe </LOCATION> <LOCATION> de </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Toloco </LOCATION> to within 10 miles. <PERSON> Milanich </PERSON> and researchers contracted with the Space Remote Sensing Center, a National Aeronautics and Space Administration-supported research center in <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>. Last April, a plane outfitted with a heat-sensing scanner flew over the site. Computers analyzed the site's radiated heat to differentiate surrounding soil from clay and other early construction materials, which absorb heat differently. They then created a color image which can show differences in heat of as little as a half degree. The instruments will revolutionize archaeology, <PERSON> Milanich </PERSON> said, noting they saved at least $ 10,000 in this instance and as much as five years of work. Once the imagery pinpointed parts of the mission's remnants, digs could focus on specific areas and avoid damaging important sections of the site, he said. During the latter half of the 16th century and all of the 17th century, more than 40 mission outposts dotted <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, the name given the entire known North American continent during the two centuries <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> dominated the area. One chain of missions stretched from <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Augustine </LOCATION> north to coastal <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, while another extended west across the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Panhandle </LOCATION>. One remnant of the trails that connected them is a dirt alley between homes on the west side of <LOCATION> Gainesville </LOCATION>. The indigenous Indians were eventually wiped out by <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> soldiers and diseases; Seminoles from the north took their place. The missionaries abandoned their attempt to bring Christianity to the natives.

 Authorities ordered about 2,000 people to stay away from their homes Monday as firefighters helplessly stood watching a butane fire that started when a train derailed and a tank car exploded. Police asked residents of 1,500 homes within a half mile of the derailment to evacuate after 21 <ORGANIZATION> CSX </ORGANIZATION> cars jumped a <ORGANIZATION> Conrail </ORGANIZATION> track south of downtown near the <ORGANIZATION> B.F. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Goodrich </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION> Plant Sunday evening. The fire spread briefly to the <PERSON> Goodrich </PERSON> loading dock, prompting the evacuation of workers. No one was seriously injured, officials said. The <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Akron </ORGANIZATION> as well as <LOCATION> Akron </LOCATION> public and parochial schools were closed Monday, and metropolitan bus service was canceled because the city bus garage is near the derailment. Businesses in the area of the explosion shut down. A <ORGANIZATION> CSX </ORGANIZATION> crew used a crane to begin pulling derailed cars upright, but Fire Chief <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Romanoski </PERSON> said firefighters could do nothing about the exploded tank car except to let it burn out on its own. Fires that started at a valve on an adjacent car and beneath a third car were out, he said. <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Noble </PERSON>, 83, who was awakened by her landlord and a police officer as she slept Sunday in her <LOCATION> Akron </LOCATION> apartment, waited patiently but nervously in a school cafeteria Monday as two small fires continued to burn. `` I'm calm now, but inside I'm worried,'' she said. <PERSON> Cathy </PERSON> <PERSON> Miglin </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Kenmore </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> employee who was helping the evacuees, heard the blast from her home two miles west of the derailment. `` I heard the explosion and all the sirens, and the dog next door was howling, so we knew something was up,'' she said. `` And then we saw that the sky was all lit up. `` The flames shot at least 500 feet in the air, just like a big mushroom going up. And the sirens just started coming from everywhere.'' Thirteen people were treated at <LOCATION> Akron </LOCATION> <LOCATION> General </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>, most suffering from inhalation of smoke and fumes. R.L. <PERSON> Leckie </PERSON>, spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> CSX </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Jacksonville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, said nine of the derailed cars were carrying butane. One of the tankers was ruptured by the derailment and immediately caught fire, he said. <PERSON> Claire </PERSON> <PERSON> Austin </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Railroad </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, said <ORGANIZATION> Conrail </ORGANIZATION> last inspected the track on Feb. 23. The FRA last checked in late February 1988. No problems were found last week and `` only minor variances'' were found in the 1988 inspection, Ms. <PERSON> Austin </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Conrail </ORGANIZATION> is required to inspect the track twice a week. Ms. <PERSON> Austin </PERSON> said the five FRA inspectors and <ORGANIZATION> FRA </ORGANIZATION>'s regional director at the scene have spoken with the engineer. Alcohol and drug tests have been conducted, but the results were not immediately known. `` There did n't seem to be any problem with that from what they saw,'' she said. `` The cause of the derailment remains unknown.'' Evacuees were sent to the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Akron </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rhodes </PERSON> <PERSON> Arena </PERSON>, and many went to stay with relatives and friends, officials said. <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> said many of the derailed cars carried non-hazardous materials, including vegetable oil, clay and sand. One car carried butadiene, which may produce hazardous smoke when burned, but it was too far from the burning cars to cause concern, Mayor <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Plusquellic </PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Lukens </PERSON> said Monday he was set up and solicited for money in connection with an alleged sexual incident involving a teen-age girl. In an interview at his district office in this western <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> city, <ORGANIZATION> Lukens </ORGANIZATION> denied the charge of contributing to the unruliness and delinquency of a child, a 16-year-old girl. A grand jury in Columbus indicted the 58-year-old Republican on the misdemeanor charge Thursday. `` I was approached for money on the basis of the general allegation,'' he said. `` I said, ` Hey, I'm not going to pay any money. Nothing happened.''' <ORGANIZATION> Lukens </ORGANIZATION> said he was asked for money more than once, with the threat that those involved would go to police and the news media if he refused. He questioned why police were not immediately notified following the alleged incident. `` I believe that I was set up, and I know for a fact because I was the person they asked for money,'' <ORGANIZATION> Lukens </ORGANIZATION> said. He would not specify who approached him for money, adding that there are some things he ca n't discuss because they will be the basis of his defense. In an interview with a <LOCATION> Dayton </LOCATION> television station, <ORGANIZATION> Lukens </ORGANIZATION> denied having sex with the girl. `` Did you have sex with -LRB- the girl -RRB-?'' the interviewer asked. `` No,'' <ORGANIZATION> Lukens </ORGANIZATION> replied. <ORGANIZATION> Lukens </ORGANIZATION>, who is divorced, did not deny he knew the girl and said he met her on occasion. <ORGANIZATION> Lukens </ORGANIZATION> made his remarks during interviews with reporters following a meeting with local supporters and constituents in <LOCATION> Greenville </LOCATION>, which is about 40 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Dayton </LOCATION>. Earlier Monday, <ORGANIZATION> Lukens </ORGANIZATION> met with supporters at a private residence in <LOCATION> Middletown </LOCATION> and gave interviews to newspapers in <LOCATION> Hamilton </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Eaton </PERSON>. They were his first public appearances in his district since the investigation was revealed nearly a month ago. `` I'm back at work,'' <ORGANIZATION> Lukens </ORGANIZATION> said, promising to complete his two-year congressional term, which expires in 1990. <ORGANIZATION> Lukens </ORGANIZATION> charged that the news media assumed he was guilty and failed to investigate the moral character of the people involved. He also accused <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION> television station <ORGANIZATION> WSYX </ORGANIZATION> of delaying broadcast of a videotaped meeting he had with the girl's mother for five weeks to take advantage of a ratings week. WSYX News Director <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Twentier </PERSON> denied the charge. <ORGANIZATION> Lukens </ORGANIZATION> said he has not seen the secretly recorded videotape, which shows him meeting with <PERSON> Anna </PERSON> <PERSON> Coffman </PERSON> last November in a <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION> fast-food restaurant.

 The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> ethics committee Monday began an exhaustive review of a special counsel's investigative report on alleged ethics violations of Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, and members said they would be in no rush to finish. The panel's closed-door deliberations are being held in strict secrecy and committee Chairman Rep. <PERSON> Julian </PERSON> <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON>, D-Calif., said he expects no announcement of any results until the week of March 13 `` I think everyone's getting their questions answered,'' said Rep. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Myers </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, the panel's senior Republican, after seven hours of deliberations. `` We are dealing with very sensitive matters here _ people's careers.'' The committee is scheduled to meet again Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday, and panel members have been asked to keep their calendars clear next week as well. <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON> said the special outside counsel hired to investigate the <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> matter, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Phelan </PERSON>, is presenting his findings count by count. Members can then ask questions and <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s lawyer, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Oldaker </PERSON>, can comment on the evidence, he said. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, is alleged, in a six-count resolution, to have abused his office for personal financial gain. The charges include using a congressional aide to help compile a book on which <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> earned some $ 55,000 in royalties and using a condominium in his hometown of <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION> without paying full market value. He also is alleged to have improperly lobbied federal officials on behalf of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> savings and loan institutions and lobbied for a gas venture in which he had a financial stake. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> has steadfastly denied violating any law or rule of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, although he has conceded he might have done some things differently if he had them to do over. The committee has spent nearly $ 1 million on the probe, which began in June, most of it for <PERSON> Phelan </PERSON>'s legal fees. His report to the committee runs about 450 pages and includes only findings of fact on the six allegations against <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, but no recommendations on whether the facts warrant disciplinary action, said one committee source, speaking only on condition of anonymity. The source said <PERSON> Phelan </PERSON> has used the broadest possible interpretation of each of the six counts, and has in some cases divided them into sub-categories. That enabled <PERSON> Phelan </PERSON>, for example, to go into <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s financial dealings with <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION> business partner <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mallick </PERSON> under the heading of looking into the condominium, which was owned by <PERSON> Mallick </PERSON>'s son. <PERSON> Myers </PERSON> said the presence of <PERSON> Oldaker </PERSON> was unusual. But he added: `` We're just trying to be as generous as we can.'' Committee rules provide that a member who is the subject of an investigation can be given a chance to comment on the allegations. The process `` is adversarial in the sense that both sides will represent their points of view,'' <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON> said. `` The facts are always subject to interpretation.'' <PERSON> Oldaker </PERSON> had no comment on the probe as he entered the hearing room, except to say: `` The process has gone on for a long period of time. We hope for an early resolution.'' The committee's current deliberations are the culmination of a process known as a preliminary inquiry, the panel's equivalent of a grand jury investigation. <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON> said the committee will hear the presentations of the two lawyers and discuss the findings, then decide whether to take the next step in the process _ issuing a statement of alleged violation, which is akin to an indictment. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> has not been given a copy of <PERSON> Phelan </PERSON>'s report and was not scheduled to attend the deliberations, <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Ag Officials Say Food Supply Safe from Aflatoxin Health Threat</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT LEE ZIMMER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHAMPAIGN, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Public health is not threatened by aflatoxin, a cancer-causing substance found in part of the nation's corn supply, agricultural leaders said Monday Directors of agriculture from key farm states said recent reports that corn containing aflatoxin had escaped detection and gotten into food products were misleading. `` Consumers need not be afraid that tainted products are in the food chain,'' said <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> Cochran </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> secretary of agriculture. `` Yes, I'm quite convinced ... that the supply is being checked quite carefully.'' The heat and drought of 1988 provided ideal conditions for development of the fungus that produces aflatoxin, which has been linked to the development of liver cancer in laboratory rats. The <ORGANIZATION> Wall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Street </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION> reported last week that aflatoxin-tainted corn is moving through the nation's food supply. The newspaper, which conducted a five-month-investigation, reported that inadequate sampling and unreliable testing of corn after the harvest contributed to the distribution of tainted grain. But <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> agriculture director <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Werries </PERSON> said tests by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> showed no aflatoxin contamination of finished food products in his state. <PERSON> Werries </PERSON> said his own agency's tests of milk samples also showed no contamination. Dairy cattle are fed corn, and he said that should be `` the first place it shows.'' The limit for aflatoxin is 20 parts per billion for corn that will be used in food production or will be fed to dairy cattle, said <PERSON> Werries </PERSON>. Under current regulations, corn with higher levels of aflatoxin may be fed to meat-producing animals such as cattle and hogs. So even if a farmer sold corn with more than 20 parts per billion of aflatoxin, `` the elevator likely has an outlet for it,'' said <PERSON> Werries </PERSON>. `` In my opinion, the system works,'' he said. <PERSON> Cochran </PERSON> said tests by his agency in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> showed 98 percent of the milk samples were safe. Milk from three farms was tainted, so it was not distributed and other milk sales by those farms was stopped, he said. <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>'s director of agriculture, <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Kruse </PERSON>, said there probably was no greater problem with aflatoxin in his state this year than in some previous years. `` There is a greater awareness ... than perhaps there was five or 10 years ago,'' said <PERSON> Kruse </PERSON>. `` There is certainly more testing going on now.'' The Journal said some experts do not believe the government or the grain industry can deal adequately with the aflatoxin outbreak of 1988. `` There is just no way of policing a massive system of commerce and trade,'' plant pathologist <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Georgia </ORGANIZATION> told the newspaper. Officials at the world's largest cereal mill _ <ORGANIZATION> Quaker </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oats </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Cedar </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rapids </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> _ say they test incoming corn for aflatoxin. `` It's the most serious thing we look for,'' plant manager <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Dykes </PERSON> told the Journal. `` I do n't think farmers and elevators do screen for aflatoxin.'' But <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Wentworth </PERSON>, an <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> farmer and president of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Growers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, said there is extensive aflatoxin testing by both the government and private industry. And he said it was misleading to suggest that farmers are ignorant of the problem or are willing to try to sell corn that exceeds federal limits for aflatoxin. `` Farmers are consumers and want the nation's food supply to be as safe as possible,'' <PERSON> Wentworth </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Bush's Remarks As He Returns From Trip</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Here is a transcript of President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s remarks Monday at <ORGANIZATION> Andrews </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> as he returned from his trip to <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> Well, let me just say that it is great to be back home again at the conclusion of a productive and rewarding trip to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, a trip which underscored that <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> is and will remain a <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> power. There were important symbols. I'll never forget that solemn moment when we paid our nation's respect to the late emperor of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>; the warm and genuine handshakes between old friends in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hall </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> the </LOCATION> <LOCATION> People </LOCATION>; the opportunity for the freely elected leader of a 200-year-old nation to address the freely elected legislature of a blossoming democracy, <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> But, we laid out an important substantive course, thoughtful and candid conversations with world leaders, over 20 of them, leaders from <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>: <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, and the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>; and our allies from <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>: <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>; and meeting leaders from the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>: <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON>, and the presidents of <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nigeria </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Zaire </LOCATION>. And, so, I return tonight pleased with the progress made toward lasting and mutually beneficial relationships with our allies and friends. Of course differences remain. Work is yet to be done; opening foreign markets to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> competition, continuing to encourage the growth of democracy and human rights and strengthening of our alliances. But, common ground was found. In <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, we have our most important Asian ally and one of our largest trading partners. Our discussions there emphasized the responsibilities we share in the field of defense. But, we also spoke of ways in which the world's strongest and most innovative economies can cooperate more closely to fuel growth not only at home, but also in the developing world. In <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, I talked with the leaders that I'd known nearly 15 years ago when I served as chief of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liaison </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>. And, it is clear from my trip that <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> approaches its thaw with the Soviets with caution and realism. We agreed that the Soviets must be judged not by their rhetoric, but by their actions. Such as whether the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> actually draws down its military forces along <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s border and persists in encouraging <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> to completely withdraw from <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>. We also agreed that after <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> has achieved a genuine end to <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s occupation, free elections should be held under a coalition government, led by <PERSON> Prince </PERSON> <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON>, with whom I met in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> remains committed to a result that precludes a return to power by the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> and the Chinese leaders appreciate our concern and are willing to work toward a peaceful coalition. On the final leg of my journey, I went to <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, where I saw both democracy and economic liberty work in a country whose security is assured by our joint efforts and vigilance. Thirty years ago, such progress was unimaginable and it stands as a testament to the <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> people and our commitment to them. From these four days of intensive discussions, I return with one especially vivid impression. The world looks to <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> for leadership, not just because we're militarily strong, not just because we have the world's largest economy, but because the ideas we have championed are now dominant _ freedom and democracy, openness and the prosperity that derives from individual initiatives in the free marketplace These ideas, once thought to be strictly American, have now become the goals of mankind all over <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>. The success of our nation's foreign policy is the responsibility of the president, with the counsel and support of the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. And this important trip has only underscored for me what can be achieved through a strong and bipartisan working relationship between the White House and <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. I'm anxious to sit down with congressional leadership to brief them on details of these critical visits. And together we must ensure that this initial success is only a first step down a long path of peace and understanding with our friends and allies. If common ground can be found halfway around the world in the shadow of <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fuji </LOCATION>, in the historic Great Hall of the People, or the Garden of <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Blue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, surely it can be found at home among men and women of common purpose. We must respect each other and join together as one in pursuing a foreign policy that ensures the security of our country, its economic opportunity and freedom and individual rights around the world. It's great to be home. God bless the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. Thank you all very much.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> returned home Monday night from a five-day <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> voyage that he pronounced a `` productive and rewarding'' journey and moved to take personal command of the struggle to win confirmation for <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tower </PERSON> as defense secretary. In a prepared statement he read at the foot of the ramp to Air Force One, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said his trip to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> demonstrated that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> `` is and will remain a <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> power.'' `` It's great to be home. God bless the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said in the chilly darkness at <ORGANIZATION> Andrews </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> in suburban <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>. Vice President <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> was on hand to welcome the new president back from his first overseas voyage. In his brief statement, the president said he had held `` thoughtful and candid conversations'' with world leaders, including the several he met with in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, where he attended the funeral of Emperor <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>. From there he went to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> for two days, followed by a five-hour stopover in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>. `` I return tonight pleased with the progress made toward lasting and mutually beneficial relationships,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. He said work remains to be done toward encouraging the growth of democracy, working for human rights, strengthening international alliances and opening foreign markets to <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> goods. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> made no direct reference to the Tower nomination in his airport statement. But in comments to reporters just before his plane touched down, he said, `` No one has challenged his qualifications to head the Pentagon.'' `` I do n't have any predictions nor do I plan to except to say I have n't wavered one iota and I do n't intend to,'' he said. In assessing his trip, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also addressed relations between <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, although he did n't mention <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s springtime visit to <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. `` <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> approaches its thaw with the Soviets with caution and realism. We agreed that the Soviets must be judged not by their rhetoric but by their actions, such as whether the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> actually draws down its military forces along <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s border and persists in encouraging <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> to completely withdraw from <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also said he agreed with the Chinese that free elections should be held in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> after <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> occupation ends `` under a coalition government led by <PERSON> Prince </PERSON> <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON> ... The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> remains committed by a result that precludes a return to power by the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> and the Chinese leaders appreciate our concern and are willing to work toward a peaceful coalition,'' he said. Tower has been plagued by allegations of drinking and womanizing, as well as possible conflicts of interest stemming from the hundreds of thousands of dollars he received as a defense industry consultant in recent years. Asked whether Tower's weekend vow of alcohol abstinence would help his chances, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> laughed and said, `` I do n't know.'' White House Chief of Staff <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> was meeting with <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> senators to discuss the nomination shortly after <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> One landed in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. Aides said the president intended to spare no effort in a bid to prevail in the first high-stakes political struggle of his administration. He invited <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> to the White House for breakfast on Tuesday, the first of several planned sessions with Democrats whose votes will be crucial to Tower's chances. Tower's appointment was rejected 11-9 in a party line vote last week by the <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, and the full <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> is expected to take up the appointment beginning on Wednesday. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> planned to meet at the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> with 12 Democratic senators beginning shortly after 8 a.m. Tuesday morning in a bid to get them to `` keep an open mind'' and build support for Tower, said <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>. The president's aides say they are hopeful that Tower's unusual weekend pledge to abstain from drinking alcohol if confirmed would help boost his chances. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said that `` should take care of the drinking situation'' that many senators said was bothering them. But prospects for confirmation still appeared difficult. Defense was also the main subject in <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s speech earlier Monday to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>. The president vowed to keep <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops stationed there so long as they were requested by the government to preserve stability. On another subject, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> voiced concerns over the <LOCATION> U.S.-South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> trade imbalance, both in his speech to the lawmakers and after a meeting with President <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> <PERSON> Tae-Woo </PERSON>. He suggested that <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> do more to lower its barriers to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> goods. `` <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> has benefited from the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> open markets ... We must expect fair access to the markets here,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said after the meeting with <PERSON> Roh </PERSON>. <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> voiced support for free markets throughout the world. He said he and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> agreed to work on problems `` resulting from the rapid expansion of economic relations between our two countries.'' Returning to the West, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> left a volatile climate in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, with anti-American protesters and police clashing in the streets of at least six cities. In <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>, about 700 radical students shouting `` <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> go home!'' threw firebombs and rocks at police around <ORGANIZATION> Dongguk </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in an abortive attempt to march on the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> about three miles away. Students burned effigies of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> Tae-woo at a rally on the school grounds, and leaders charged that <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> keeps troops in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> to enforce its rule. Police arrested about 15 prominent dissidents shouting `` no <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> visit'' who had tried to assemble near the downtown embassy. The anti-American violence prompted tight security for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s brief visit, and his trip from a military airfield to town for his meetings was made by helicopter

 Two scholars think King Arthur's men gathered in <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>, not southwest <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, and believe they were knights of the round room, not the round table, the publisher of <PERSON> Burke </PERSON>'s Peerage said Monday <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Brooks-Baker </PERSON>, who presides over the directory of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s aristocracy, said <PERSON> Norma </PERSON> <PERSON> Goodrich </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Claremont </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> are convinced by their research in the area that the knights assembled near <LOCATION> Stirling </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION> <PERSON> Brooks-Baker </PERSON>, in a press statement, said the scholars believe what became known as the round table actually was a rotunda and the mistake was made in translating the word `` roonde'' _ apparently early French _ as an adjective rather than a noun meaning rotunda. The stones are believed buried near the river <PERSON> Carron </PERSON>, where they were used to repair a dam in 1743, and one was found at the time to have been carved, said the publisher, who offered few specifics to support his case. King <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON>, Guinevere, Sir <PERSON> Galahad </PERSON> and Sir <PERSON> Lancelot </PERSON> are part of a story that developed in the 12th century, apparently based on a <LOCATION> Roman-British </LOCATION> leader who fought <PERSON> Saxon </PERSON> invaders in the 6th century. <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON>'s legend was embroidered through the ages and immortalized by writers Sir <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Malory </PERSON> and T.H. White and the poet <PERSON> Tennyson </PERSON>. Many say the heroic king was buried in <LOCATION> Glastonbury </LOCATION>, southwest <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>. The village of <LOCATION> Tintagel </LOCATION>, also in the southwest, has a long association with Arthurian legend. An archaelogical site at <LOCATION> Yeovil </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Somerset </LOCATION>, southwest <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, is suggested as a possible Camelot, the capital of <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON>'s kingdom, so if <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> really lived in <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION> it's a sharp change of direction. Test drilling has been done at the Stirling site and excavation will cost more than $ 260,000, <PERSON> Brooks-Baker </PERSON> said. In October, Ms. <PERSON> Goodrich </PERSON> said research by <PERSON> Brooks-Baker </PERSON>'s publishing house proved one of <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON>'s forts was at <LOCATION> Ayr </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>, which <PERSON> Burke </PERSON>'s said was known as Camelot Ayr is 55 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Stirling </LOCATION>. Ms. <PERSON> Goodrich </PERSON> is described as the author of the books `` Merlin'' -LRB- named for <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON>'s sorcerer -RRB- and `` King Arthur.'' <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> is described as having conducted extensive research on the subject for more than six years.

 The head of a <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> chemical company suspected of helping <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> build a poison gas plant will resign at the end of next month, the company announced Monday night. <PERSON> Juergen </PERSON> <PERSON> Hippenstiel-Imhausen </PERSON> will leave his post as director of the <ORGANIZATION> Imhausen-Chemie </ORGANIZATION> company of <PERSON> Lahr </PERSON>, spokesman <PERSON> Moritz </PERSON> <PERSON> Hunzinger </PERSON> told reporters. <PERSON> Hippenstiel </PERSON> did not appear at the news conference and has not been seen in public since mid-January, when suspicions mounted that his firm organized construction and outfitting of a chemical weapons plant in <LOCATION> Rabta </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>. No charges have been filed against anyone at <ORGANIZATION> Imhausen </ORGANIZATION> or other West German firms said to have played a role in building the plant, which Libyan officials say is intended to produce medicines. <ORGANIZATION> Imhausen </ORGANIZATION> officials said last month that <PERSON> Hippenstiel </PERSON> fled with his family after receiving death threats, but he is believed to have since returned to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. His resignation, effective March 31, appears to be the result of pressure from the <ORGANIZATION> federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>, which refused to pay the firm for three projects it has under contract with <ORGANIZATION> Imhausen </ORGANIZATION> as long as <PERSON> Hippenstiel </PERSON> remained in charge. The local parliamentary representative and business council also demanded that <PERSON> Hippenstiel </PERSON> step down. Federal authorities have been investigating <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> allegations that <ORGANIZATION> Imhausen </ORGANIZATION> played a key role in the <LOCATION> Rabta </LOCATION> plant, but they say no evidence has been uncovered that could stand up in court. Officials conceded privately they fear any incriminating evidence may have been taken out of the country prior to the investigations, which began months after <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials first brought up the <ORGANIZATION> Imhausen </ORGANIZATION> name with West German authorities.

 Black African leaders on Monday attacked suggestions that the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> peacekeeping force in <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> may buy or lease military equipment from <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. Squabbles over purchasing have delayed funding approval. On April 1, <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> peacekeepers plan to begin implementing a one-year plan for <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>'s independence from 74 years of South African rule. <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> officials have said they need make purchases from <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, which lies on <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>'s southern border, to keep down the cost of the mission that has a proposed budget of $ 416 million. Ambassador <PERSON> Isack </PERSON> <PERSON> Stanislaus </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorerazvo </PERSON> <PERSON> Mudenge </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Zimbabwe </LOCATION>, representing the non-aligned movement, said Monday no need exists to depend on <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> for military equipment. He said he accepted that <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> dominates the economy of the region and said peacekeepers could buy anything except military equipment from that white-dominated nation. Zambian Ambassador <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Dingiswayo </PERSON> <PERSON> Zuze </PERSON>, representing the black African front-line states, joined <PERSON> Mudenge </PERSON> at the news conference. The front-line states border on <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> or are particularly concerned with events there. They are <LOCATION> Zimbabwe </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Zambia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Botswana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tanzania </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Mudenge </PERSON> said dependence on <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> may be unavoidable in the early stages, `` but we expect them -LRB- the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> officials -RRB- to plan so as to minimize that dependence.'' The <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>'s finance committee has been deadlocked over the procurement issue since last week. The <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> has had to hold up approving the funding for the <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> force. Front-line states insist on inserting language into the funding resolution referring to <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> embargoes on buying military equipment, oil or other goods from <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> oppose including such language.

 A comprehensive agreement to clean up the nation's most contaminated nuclear weapons-production site was signed Monday by the federal government and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state, but the pact had no guarantee that money will be available to complete the job at the <LOCATION> Hanford </LOCATION> nuclear reservation. At a signing ceremony, state and federal officials said the `` landmark'' agreement will provide a `` clear road map'' for cleaning up the 570 square mile reservation in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state and serve as a model for other <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> weapons plants. The department also made public Monday documents that estimated five billion cubic yards of hazardous solid and liquid wastes, both radioactive and toxic, have been disposed of at <LOCATION> Hanford </LOCATION>. The documents said that `` above-background concentrations'' of such substances as tritium, Iodine-129, uranium and cyanide have been found in the groundwater beneath the reservation and may threaten the nearby <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>. `` These materials have toxic, carcinogenic, mutagenic, or teratogenic effects on humans and other life forms,'' the documents said, adding that there continue to be releases of hazardous compounds. Under the agreement announced Monday, the department has promised to seek $ 2.8 billion for the Hanford clean up over five years, but the appropriation has yet to receive the blessing of the White House budget office and will eventually have to be approved by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. After five years, the agreement calls for the state and the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> to sit down and come up with additional requests to finance continued cleanup, which by department estimates could cost $ 57 billion. `` We are extremely satisfied with the money provisions,'' said <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Booth </PERSON> <PERSON> Gardner </PERSON>. Key provisions of the `` Hanford Action Cleanup Action Plan'' include: _ An accelerated program for actually cleaning up the reservation over 30 years, rather than 50 years as originally envisioned _ Specific cleanup milestones DOE could be fined up to $ 10,000 per week for failing to meet the milestones. _ Clear delineation of duties between the state, the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and the federal <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> _ An agreement, which the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> has agreed to, allowing the state or members of the general public to enforce the agreement by filing a lawsuit if necessary In addition, the federal government has agreed to provide <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state $ 2.9 million over three years to fund the state's oversight role The agreement was reached after more than a year of negotiations and amid threats that the state would go to court if negotiations failed. Besides being the most contaminated of the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s 16 nuclear weapons-productions sites, the <LOCATION> Hanford </LOCATION> reservation is expected to be the most costly to clean up and take the longest. <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Winston </PERSON> <PERSON> Porter </PERSON>, an assistant <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> administration, said the Hanford site offers the `` toughest problems'' of any site. `` It will be the largest clean up in terms of time, cost and complexity,'' said <PERSON> Porter </PERSON>. Stored at <LOCATION> Hanford </LOCATION> is more than 60 percent of the nation's high-level radioactive waste generated by weapons programs dating back to World War II Scientists at the reservation worked on the bomb that was dropped at <LOCATION> Nagasaki </LOCATION>. In the 1950s Hanford was one of the largest weapon's production complexes At present, only one commercial nuclear power plant is operating at the reservation and the department has announced plans to phase out all weapons production activities at the site.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Sony </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> refused to comment Monday on published reports that the company was set to purchase <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pictures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Entertainment </ORGANIZATION>. Trade newspapers <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Variety </ORGANIZATION> and The Hollywood Reporter both reported Monday that a <ORGANIZATION> Sony </ORGANIZATION> acquisition of the struggling film studio was imminent. `` The deal is done,'' Variety quoted three `` well-placed sources'' as saying. The Hollywood Reporter said industry speculation hinted that <ORGANIZATION> Sony </ORGANIZATION> had `` cinched a deal to buy <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION>.'' `` We have no comment on that item at this time,'' said <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Petty </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Sony </ORGANIZATION>'s director of corporate communications. But, <PERSON> Petty </PERSON> added, `` It's a well-known fact ... we are looking to get into the entertainment industry.'' Last year, <ORGANIZATION> Sony </ORGANIZATION> completed its purchase of <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Records </ORGANIZATION> for about $ 2 billion. A spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> who asked not to be identified said the studio would n't comment on the reports. <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> is 49 percent owned by <ORGANIZATION> Coca-Cola </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>. Rumors regarding <ORGANIZATION> Sony </ORGANIZATION>'s buying a major film studio have circulated in <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> for months, and the company has been linked to <ORGANIZATION> MGM-UA </ORGANIZATION> as well as <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION>. The latter studio has labored through a flood of box-office disappointments, including `` Punchline,'' `` Rocket Gibraltar,'' `` The New Adventures of <PERSON> Pippi </PERSON> <PERSON> Longstocking </PERSON>,'' `` Things Change'' and, most recently, `` Physical Evidence.''

<TEXT>
 Industrial workers have formed the first independent blue-collar union in postwar <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, using <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s banned Solidarity as a model and intending to campaign for trade union pluralism About 500 men and women launched Workers' Solidarity during a meeting Saturday, and the group plans to hold its founding meeting in May, the official <ORGANIZATION> MTI </ORGANIZATION> news agency reported Monday. The union blamed the ruling <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> party </ORGANIZATION> for failing to live up to one of its fundamental tenets _ the protection of workers' rights About half a dozen independent trade unions have sprung up in <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> over the past year. To date, however, they have been dominated by white-collar workers rather than factory labor. The new union was formed amid a growing economic crisis in <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, where living standards are falling as inflation reaches 20 percent. Meanwhile, a veteran Communist party member asked a party's district committee in <LOCATION> Budapest </LOCATION> at an a weekend public debate that it should take a stand in favor of the one-party system, the daily <ORGANIZATION> Magyar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nemzet </ORGANIZATION> said Monday Another party conservative, <PERSON> Gyula </PERSON> <PERSON> Sandor </PERSON>, secretary of a local party chapter comprised of old age pensioners, claimed `` an open, anti-communist aggression has been going on'' in <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>. `` A section of the intellectual aristocracy, who is well off, is waging an open struggle against us -LRB- communists -RRB-,'' <ORGANIZATION> Magyar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nemzet </ORGANIZATION> quoted <PERSON> Sandor </PERSON> as saying.

 Airlines worldwide were advised to check the cargo doors of their <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 747s as federal investigators focused Monday on the cargo door latch system of a <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> jumbo jet that ripped open at 22,000 feet. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Transportation Secretary <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> said he thinks `` it's very important that we not jump to conclusions until that report -LRB- on the investigation -RRB- is done.'' `` The preliminary indications, of course, are that the -LRB- cargo -RRB- door opened or at least the skin peeled around the door. But let's wait until the board reports, then we'll know finally what went on,'' <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> said in an interview Monday with <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Good Morning America. <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> announced that it conducted detailed examinations of all cargo doors in every plane in its fleet. Seven doors required repairs, the airline said, but spokesman <PERSON> Rob </PERSON> <PERSON> Doughty </PERSON> said none of the repairs was urgent. `` The items we repaired did not affect operating performance or airworthiness,'' he said. <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION>'s Flight 811 was gaining altitude 100 miles south of here after taking off for <LOCATION> Auckland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION>, early Friday when a 10-by-20-foot section of the fuselage ripped away, including the right front cargo door. Nine passengers disappeared when 10 seats in the business class on the right side were blown out through the gaping hole, investigators said. There was no indication from the ground crew or cockpit crew that anything was amiss when the cargo door was secured for flight, said <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Dickinson </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> investigator. <PERSON> Dickinson </PERSON> said investigators have found no evidence of a bomb, sabotage or metal fatigue that might have caused the mishap, and `` are focusing on and looking at the latching mechanism.'' `` We're also trying to get a better handle on these latch pin supports and comparing them to others,'' he said. The cargo bay door closed electrically, with eight latching mechanisms along the bottom, attached to the plane's frame, as well as a latching mechanism and a hook pin on each side, <PERSON> Dickinson </PERSON> said. Investigators determined Sunday that a warning system, that would have alerted the cockpit crew if the door was not closed properly, did work, <PERSON> Dickinson </PERSON> said at the <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION>'s news briefing Sunday night. <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> on Sunday advised all airlines to check the cargo doors of their 747s, and <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> investigators inspected the doors of other <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> 747s at <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> the next day, <PERSON> Doughty </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> said it has delivered 712 Boeing 747s of all types around the world. `` What this is from us is by no means interfering or speculating on the probable cause of the accident,'' <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> Spokesman <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Jiminez </PERSON> said Monday. `` It's more of a prudent act on our part to keep customers appraised of what we know.'' United President <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON> said an FAA-licensed mechanic would inspect each 747's cargo doors upon arrival and departure and would oversee the closing of each cargo door before departure. In a statement issued from its <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> headquarters, <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> said it conducted detailed examinations Sunday and Monday of more than 900 cargo doors in its fleet of 399 aircraft, including <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 727s, 737s, 747s, and DC-10s made by <ORGANIZATION> McDonnell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. The seven repairs included repairing a 2-inch crack in the doorframe of a 737, replacing a doorstop on a 737, replacing two small brackets on a 747 latch mechanism and adjusting a DC-10 motor, the statement said. `` All of these repairs ... would have been performed in the normal course of maintenance,'' the statement said. `` Of more than 1,700 daily <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> flights, only two delays and one cancellation were necessary.'' Meanwhile, <PERSON> Doughty </PERSON> hailed the pilot of the crippled jet, Capt. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Cronin </PERSON>, as a hero for controlling the craft. <PERSON> Cronin </PERSON> and the other 17 crewmembers of the plane have not been allowed to talk to the media, <PERSON> Doughty </PERSON> said. `` Although we have nothing but praise for Capt. <PERSON> Cronin </PERSON> and the rest the crew, we do n't want anyone to draw conclusions about the crash based on a brief interview,'' he said. Unions representing the flight and ground crews of Flight 811 are working with investigators in an effort to reassure the public following last Friday's incident, union leaders said Monday. `` Instead of seeing who might be blamed, it's our primary concern to find out what happened and make sure we can keep it from happening again,'' said <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Poomaihealani </PERSON>, assistant general chairman of District 141, <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION>. The union represents all ground employes of <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION>. A three-day search by <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> ships and aircraft resulted on the recovery of 57 pieces of debris that fell from the plane, incuding airline seat cushions, an overhead compartment, a section of fuselage, and personal itmes, including a teddy bear. Not recovered was the cargo door. `` Obviously, if we had the door it would be very helpful to us,'' <PERSON> Dickinson </PERSON> said, but said he was confident other information will pinpoint the cause of the accident. Of the 354 people aboard the plane, incuding 18 crewmembers, 27 were treated at <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION> hospitals, mostly for minor injuries caused by flying debris. One was released from the hospital Monday, leaving two still hospitalized.

Since its debut on the seven Fox-owned stations Jan. 7, `` COPS'' has received good ratings and critical praise.

It uses no actors and has no script. <PERSON> Fox </PERSON>'s Sunday night schedule, led by `` Married ...

The Saturday night schedule of `` The Reporters'' and `` Beyond Tomorrow'' has consistently been at the bottom of the ratings, along with `` Duet'' from Sunday night.

Guerrillas had said in communiques in recent months that the emerald dealer and the drug trafficker had organized death squads to kill peasants who sympathized with leftist rebels. Also Monday, a bomb exploded in the <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION> offices of a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> missionary group, slightly injuring five people, the organization's local director reported National police said leftist guerrillas freed 11 policemen Monday who were captured during a raid in early February. The bomb exploded at the <ORGANIZATION> Summer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Linguistics </ORGANIZATION>, which is based in <LOCATION> Duncanville </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Tex </PERSON>. Three Americans and two Colombians suffered minor cuts, local director <PERSON> Abe </PERSON> <PERSON> Coop </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> by telephone. <ORGANIZATION> RCN </ORGANIZATION> said an anonymous telephone caller claimed responsibility on behalf of the leftist <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> and warned of more attacks on the institute. Summer Linguistics, which has operated in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> since 1962, devises written languages for Indian tribes and translates the Bible into those languages. Coop said the Americans injured Monday were <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Pagel </PERSON> of <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paso </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Tex </PERSON>.; <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Cartwright </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Hartland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> <PERSON> Storm </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla </LOCATION>. Guerrillas kidnapped and murdered one of the institute's missionaries, <PERSON> Chester </PERSON> <PERSON> Bitterman </PERSON>, in <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION> in 1981, accusing him of working for the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> Kidnappers seized two American missionaries from another organization Jan. 10 in western <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>.

The 11 policemen were captured Feb. 8 during an attack on <LOCATION> Valencia </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Huila </LOCATION> state, southern <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>. At the time, police said five officers were killed.

 A Chilean navy cutter and British repair ship were on alert Monday against the threat of an oil spill from a Peruvian research vessel that ran aground in <LOCATION> Antarctica </LOCATION>, officials said. The British ice patrol ship Endurance earlier Monday rescued 64 scientists and sailors from the crippled vessel, the 1,980-ton <PERSON> Humboldt </PERSON>, and took them to <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION>'s Marsh Base antarctic station, according to the Chilean navy. In a communique, the navy said the Endurance tried unsucessfully to lighten the Humboldt, which ran aground and began taking on water after hitting rocks Sunday night off King <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Island </PERSON>. In a second communique later Monday, the navy said some diesel oil had spilled, creating a slick 150 yards by five yards. It said that apparently two of the ship's four fuel tanks had split. A cutter from the Chilean navy, the <PERSON> Yelcho </PERSON>, was sent quickly Monday from <ORGANIZATION> Punta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arenas </ORGANIZATION>, on the southern tip of the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> continent, to `` lend all the necessary support both in efforts to rescue the <LOCATION> Humboldt </LOCATION> and to control the pollution from the oil spill that may occur,'' the navy said. The Humboldt is listing slightly to the right but is not in danger of sinking, it said. A spokesman for the British navy said in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> the repair ship <PERSON> Stena </PERSON> <PERSON> Seaspread </PERSON> will stand by the stricken ship to monitor pollution and help with any salvage work. The site is 300 miles from the area where the Argentine ship <ORGANIZATION> Bahia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Paraiso </ORGANIZATION> ran aground and sank Jan. 28, spilling fuel oil into the region's usually pristine waters. The spill was cleaned up by ships from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>. Damage to the <LOCATION> Antarctic </LOCATION> environment is still being evaluated.

 A delegation from the opposition left on Monday for talks with the presidents of <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>, seeking their support to make sure <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> meets its obligations under a Central American peace pact. Opposition leader <PERSON> Gilberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuadra </PERSON> said the presidents' backing `` is necessary, apart from our own efforts'' to ensure fair elections in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. The government party, the leftist <ORGANIZATION> Sandinista </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, already has begun what amounts to a veiled election campaign, with President <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> as the obvious candidate. Also Monday, <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> sent the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> a proposed decree that would pardon 1,932 former members of ousted dictator <PERSON> Anastaso </PERSON> <PERSON> Somoza </PERSON>'s hated and feared national guard. The assembly will consider the decree Tuesday. <PERSON> Cuadra </PERSON> heads the <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Private </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enterprise </ORGANIZATION>, the most important association of private business executives in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, and is a member of the delegation that left Monday. He said the delegates will meet with President <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> on Tuesday in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jose </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rican </LOCATION> capital, and with President <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Andres </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Caracas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>, on Thursday. <PERSON> Cuadra </PERSON> said they will discuss the accord which <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON>, <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> and the presidents of <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> reached at a summit in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> on Feb. 14. <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> agreed then to institute reforms to guarantee free elections, which he called to be held Feb. 25, 1990, 10 months ahead of schedule. Nearly every elective post will be on the ballot, from president and <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> deputies through town mayors. The five <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> presidents also agreed to draft by May 14 a plan to dismantle the U.S.-backed Nicaraguan rebel force. An estimated 11,000 rebels, known as Contras, are living in camps with their families in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> near the Nicaraguan border. While the opposition continues trying to form a united front _ by all indications its only chance at winning the presidential race _ the <LOCATION> Sandinistas </LOCATION> are making it increasingly clear their nominee will be <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON>. The first placards calling for <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> to run for re-election appeared at a rally Saturday in <LOCATION> Masaya </LOCATION>, 17 miles south of <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION>. `` We will win the 1990 elections just like we won the 1984 elections,'' <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> told the rally. Interior Minister <PERSON> Tomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Borge </PERSON> meanwhile was telling foreign correspondents in <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION> that the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinista </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> had not yet chosen a presidential candidate. <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> said in a televised interview on Feb. 15 that running for re-election `` is no sin,'' the closest he has come to saying he will run for another term. <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> had promised to release the former guardsmen at the Feb. 14 Central American summit. His decree names 1,932 ex-guardsmen convicted of `` crimes against the people'' during the <PERSON> Somoza </PERSON> dictatorship that was overthrown by the Sandinista revolution in 1979. The list includes 1,688 imprisoned ex-guardsmen and 244 who are either under house arrest or free on conditional liberty. Foreign Minister <PERSON> Miguel </PERSON> <PERSON> D'Escoto </PERSON> said `` many former Somocista guards will go free very soon, maybe tomorrow -LRB- Tuesday -RRB-. The <ORGANIZATION> Legislative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nicaragua </ORGANIZATION> will decree very shortly the liberty of those former national guardsmen.'' He spoke to reporters Monday in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pedro </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sula </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>, where he was attending a conference of foreign ministers from <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> and West European governments. The <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> said Monday that Honduran troops fired on three Nicaraguan border outposts near <LOCATION> Teotecancinte </LOCATION>, about 112 miles from <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION>, on Thursday, Saturday and Sunday. The ministry said nothing about casualties. Honduran officials were not immediately available for comment on the charges. Such allegations are frequent and usually denied by <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>.

 <LOCATION> MIAMI </LOCATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> _ Two firefighters were killed Monday in the battle against a wildfire in central <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, while other blazes scorched miles of <LOCATION> Everglades </LOCATION> sawgrass and threatened a major power line that serves the <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> area. The two volunteer firefighters from <LOCATION> Bushnell </LOCATION>, about 45 miles west of <LOCATION> Orlando </LOCATION>, had just arrived at the scene of a mile-long grass fire in the median strip of Interstate 75 when a tractor-trailer slammed into their smoke-obscured pickup, crushing both men, the <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Highway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Patrol </ORGANIZATION> said. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Reid </PERSON>, 20, was dead on the scene, while <PERSON> Ervin </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Fort </PERSON>, 33, was airlifted to <ORGANIZATION> Bayfront </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Petersburg </LOCATION>, where he was pronounced dead, the patrol said. The truck driver, <PERSON> Denver </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>, 31, of <LOCATION> Clarkton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo. </LOCATION>, was not seriously injured, <LOCATION> Sumter </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Sheriff's Capt. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Fussell </PERSON> said. The accident two miles south of <LOCATION> Bushnell </LOCATION> tied up southbound traffic for about three hours. The firefighters were the first to die so far this wildfire season. The last time a death occurred fighting a wildfire was more than four years ago, state forestry officials said. A fire emergency was declared at midday by officials in both <LOCATION> Broward </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Palm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> counties, just north of <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, placing all available firefighters on alert. The largest of the wildfires engulfed 2,700 acres of the <LOCATION> Everglades </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Broward </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, and was a major concern because it was approaching a major transmission line owned by <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Light, forestry officials said. Five to 10 miles of lines were threatened by <LOCATION> Everglades </LOCATION> fires near <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> 27 at the <LOCATION> Palm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach-Broward </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> line, said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Utley </PERSON>, a state forestry duty officer. <PERSON> Stacey </PERSON> <PERSON> Shaw </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for <ORGANIZATION> FP </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; L, said three 500-kilovolt lines were taken out of service Monday morning when fires burned into the corridor where they are located. The utility reactivated the lines after the blaze moved away from them early Monday evening, state forester <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Burke </PERSON> said. Firefighters were depending on weather conditions to help contain the <LOCATION> Everglades </LOCATION> blaze after withdrawing from the area Monday evening, <PERSON> Burke </PERSON> said. `` It will probably be burning overnight but we expect it will be under control as the humidity rises, the winds die down, and the temperatures get cooler,'' <PERSON> Burke </PERSON> said. `` I expect we'll be mopping up hopefully tommorrow.'' <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Maynard </PERSON>, assistant chief of fire control at main division offices in <LOCATION> Tallahassee </LOCATION>, said the <LOCATION> Everglades </LOCATION> fire was one of about 200 wildfires reported since Friday. Some were in <LOCATION> Palm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, where `` we had a problem with arson,'' he said. The annual bout with brushfires started much earlier this year in <LOCATION> south </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> because rainfall has been about half the normal amount since November. The <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> area has received 7 -LCB- inches of rain since September, compared with an average rainfall of 24 inches for that period, according to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. A fire which swept through 397 acres of grass and timberlands forced the evacuation of some 200 people and closed a highway Sunday in <LOCATION> Putnam </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> in northeast <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Putnam </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Sheriff's Sgt. <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Westberry </PERSON> said residents were allowed to return home early Monday. No homes or businesses were damaged, he said. Arson was believed responsible for that fire, said Assistant <LOCATION> Palatka </LOCATION> Fire Chief <PERSON> Owen </PERSON> <PERSON> Preston </PERSON>.

 A bomb killed one person and wounded seven Monday at a protest of `` The Satanic Verses'' in <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> said <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s order to kill author <PERSON> Salman </PERSON> <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> was a `` fearful example of where intolerance may lead.'' Activists in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> demonstrated for <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> outside the Iranian Embassy. In <LOCATION> Karachi </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, a bomb exploded at the <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> library while it was closed Sunday night, killing a guard. At least 18 people have been killed in <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> since Feb. 12. Both countries have banned the novel. <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> said it banned `` The Satanic Verses,'' which many Moslems consider blasphemous, a month ago and suspended all dealings with <PERSON> Viking </PERSON> <PERSON> Penguin </PERSON>, the publisher. The Information Ministry said the ban includes any other publishing house that translates or distributes the book. Moslem theologians meeting in <LOCATION> Mecca </LOCATION>, the holy city of <LOCATION> Islam </LOCATION>, branded <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> a `` heretic and a renegade'' Monday but did not endorse murdering him. Islamic law condemns heretics to death, but only after they are tried and refuse to repent. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, the government refused a request by British Moslems to extend the blasphemy law to all religions. It now covers only the Anglican faith. <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>, 41, was born into a Moslem family in <LOCATION> Bombay </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, but has become a British citizen and does not actively practice religion. The writer has been in hiding and under heavy police guard since <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> ordered his death. He has apologized for any distress `` The Satanic Verses'' caused Moslems, but <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> rejected the apology. A senior Viking Penguin editor attending an emergency meeting in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> of the <ORGANIZATION> Writers </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guild </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Great </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Britain </ORGANIZATION> said Monday hardback copies of the novel were selling so well that a paperback edition, due out in August, may be delayed for `` crude commercial'' reasons. He denied reports that Viking Penguin might cancel the paperback edition to appease Moslems. <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s 88-year-old revolutionary patriarch, ordered his followers Feb. 14 to kill <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> for blaspheming Islam and the prophet <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON>. Iranian clerics put a price of $ 5.2 million on the author's head. <LOCATION> Nigeria </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Moslems </ORGANIZATION> said Monday it supports the death sentence. A Moslem student group in <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s most populous country also demanded action against Nigerian author <PERSON> Wole </PERSON> <PERSON> Soyinka </PERSON>, the 1986 Nobel Literature laureate, for defending his fellow writer. About 300 Moslems demonstrated at the British consulate in <LOCATION> Kaduna </LOCATION> in the Moslem-dominated north. They carried placards condemning <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> and <PERSON> Soyinka </PERSON>, one of which said `` Soyinka Must Die.'' <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> got support Monday from about 15 unofficial political activists and journalists in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> who shouted `` Shame on <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>! Shame on Islam!'' outside the Iranian Embassy. Soviet media have published reports from abroad about the controversy but have not commented editorially, and the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> has said nothing. Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>, touring the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, met with <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> on Sunday. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s official news agency indicated they did not mention <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> or `` The Satanic Verses.'' A statement distributed by the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> protesters said: `` While all the civilized world is outraged'' by the death sentence, `` the Soviet government as usual remains silent.'' Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> was in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> for a summit with the French president, <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON>, and told a news conference that defending <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> `` is a fundamental matter of freedom of speech.'' `` We can not have other people inciting their own citizens to murder one of our citizens, and on that we had to be very firm,'' she said. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s parliament has scheduled a vote for Tuesday on whether to break relations with <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> told the journalists: `` In an affair of this kind, when dogmatism and fanaticism create a totally irrational situation, one must of course expect anything.'' <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Rocard </PERSON>, the French premier, said any demonstrations urging violence against <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> would result in criminal charges. British chief delegate <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Steel </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> the <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> incitement to murder was a `` fearful example of where intolerance may lead'' and `` raises.. grave issues'' for the 43-nation commission, at which <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> has observer status. The bomb in <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> exploded in <LOCATION> Srinagar </LOCATION>, summer capital of <LOCATION> Jammu-Kashmir </LOCATION> state, where a crowd was trying to enforce a strike to protest a confrontation Friday in <LOCATION> Bombay </LOCATION>. Police fireed into the crowd in <LOCATION> Bombay </LOCATION>, killing nine people. Press Trust of <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> said the bomb was intended for police who were trying stop demonstrators from forcing shops to close. The news agency said a Moslem civilian was killed and a police officer was among the wounded. Several protests have been held in <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, particularly in <LOCATION> Jammu-Kashmir </LOCATION>, the only state in the overwhelmingly Hindu nation with a Moslem majority. <LOCATION> Karachi </LOCATION> police said an explosive device weighing about to pounds went off at the British Council library. It demolished the guard room, killing <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Shafi </PERSON>, 65, and damaged a section of the outside wall, they said. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s blasphemy law applies to material found to revile, vilify or insult God, <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> <PERSON> Christ </PERSON>, the Bible or the beliefs or doctrines of Christian churches. In the most recent case, the magazine Gay News and its editor were fined a total of $ 2,600 in 1977 for publishing a poem suggesting <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> <PERSON> Christ </PERSON> was a homosexual. It was the first prosecution for blasphemous libel since 1922.

 More than half the nation may be temporarily prohibited from using <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>'s hazardous waste landfill beginning Wednesday, state health officials said Monday. Gov. <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON> <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON> said last month that he would shut the state's borders March 1 to states seeking to dispose of hazardous waste in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> that they wo n't dispose of themselves. As of Monday, 27 states had not responded to the state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION>'s request for information needed to enact <ORGANIZATION> Campbell </ORGANIZATION>'s order, officials said. The order affects the massive GSX hazardous waste landfill in <LOCATION> Sumter </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> east of <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>, which now holds close to a billion pounds of hazardous waste, about 70 percent of it from out of state. The site is one of only two commercial hazardous waste landfills in the Southeast and accepts roughly 135,000 tons of chemical garbage annually. The other site is in <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>. State health officials sent letters to all 50 states and <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION> informing them of <ORGANIZATION> Campbell </ORGANIZATION>'s order and asking for information on their waste handling laws by Feb. 15 But by Monday afternoon, only 23 states had responded. Thirty-three states, <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> used the facility in 1987, and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> officials said some states may not be responding because they will not be affected by the order. But until they know about the states' policies, all states that do n't respond will be banned, said <PERSON> Hartsill </PERSON> <PERSON> Truesdale </PERSON>, head of the health agency's hazardous waste division. Of the states that have responded, eight or nine have been tentatively put on the list to be banned, which will be presented to <ORGANIZATION> Campbell </ORGANIZATION> for approval. The list could change before Wednesday's deadline, or even afterwards, as new information is received, <PERSON> Truesdale </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Campbell </ORGANIZATION>'s staff initially said they expected the ban would fall on nine states: <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>. They estimated those states accounted for about 40 percent of the waste going to GSX. <PERSON> Truesdale </PERSON> would not comment Monday on individual states, and said the states now listed are not necessarily those suggested earlier by the governor's office. <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON>, speaking from the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Governors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> conference in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, said governors from <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> and other states had approached him about his order. He said that states would have to certify they had no impediments to disposal within their own borders or that the repeal of such impediments was imminent in order to be allowed to continue burying waste in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>. `` Our policy has to be flexible enough to work with a state that is genuinely moving to eliminate prohibitions,'' <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON> said. But, he said, `` I look for us to reach a point where there will be some states that will be cut off.''

<HEAD>Forest Service To Use Herbicides On Calif. Timberland</HEAD>

 For the first time since 1984, herbicides might be used again this year or next in national forests in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> to protect growth of commercial timber, a <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> official said Monday. At the same time, <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Weinmann </PERSON>, regional timber management director, said he expected a legal challenge by `` zealots'' over concern for possible threats to water supplies, humans and wildlife. Such challenges, currently under appeal, have stalled forest herbicide use in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>. Production in the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> region could drop an average of about 20 percent without herbicide use, <PERSON> Weinmann </PERSON> said. He said the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> region represents annual production of about 1.7-1 .8 billion board feet A board foot is a unit of measure equal to a board 1 foot square and 1 inch thick. `` We will limit the -LRB- health -RRB- risk to acceptable levels ... We believe the risks are well within acceptable limits,'' he said. `` The decision is based on an environmental analysis of all the factors relating to herbicide use.'' The 50,000 acres slated for annual herbicide applications are cut-timber country and forests burned in wildfires, he said, promising that herbicides `` will only be used where other treatment methods can not do the job effectively.'' <PERSON> Weinmann </PERSON>, demonstrating the level of favored herbicides, produced a spray container of `` Weed-B-Gon,'' a consumer product. But printed material handed reporters made clear that the service was n't ruling out the use of atrazine and 2,4-D, both under suspicion as possible cancer-causing agents. Use of these agents, said the reports, would be `` last-choice'' and limited `` to sites where no other alternative will meet management objectives.'' Failure to take the described tough measures against competing vegetation can cost as much as 300 million to 400 million board feet of lumber annually, he estimated. The idea is to control certain clovers, brush and weeds that rob trees of nutrition in a national forest-based industry that last year produced enough lumber to erect `` a city the size of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Weinmann </PERSON>. Before the moratorium in 1984, herbicides had been used in the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> national forests since the mid-1960s. The <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> manages 20 million acres of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> forest land, about a third in commercial wood product production. Lumber companies pay to harvest wood from national forests. `` We know there is going to be a challenge,'' he said. `` There are some people who very sincerely and honestly believe that herbicides are a poison that should not be used, and they are going to take whatever aggressive actions they believe they should. We have to deal with them when they come up.'' He called such people `` zealots.''

 Prospective jurors for the trial of reputed organized crime members accused in a plot against a reputed Mafia leader were asked how they view the Mafia and Italian-Americans as jury selection began Monday. A pool of 90 potential jurors was called to <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> for the case against six reputed members of the Genovese crime family. The six are charged in a racketeering conspiracy that includes controlling labor unions, extortion in the construction industry, loansharking, illegal gambling, several murders and a conspiracy to kill <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Gotti </PERSON>, the reputed boss of the rival <PERSON> Gambino </PERSON> family, and his brother, <PERSON> Gene </PERSON>. The trial is expected to provide a broad, detailed look at the workings of a major organized crime family. The <ORGANIZATION> Gottis </ORGANIZATION>' names were listed among 100 people and businesses on a questionnaire passed out to jury prospects, who were asked if they were familiar with the names.

 Leaders of the nation's largest group of school administrators voted Monday to urge principals around the country to avoid programs which force commercials into the classroom. `` We know selling junk food in the cafeteria is bad nutrition, and we know it's bad education to bring commercials into the classroom,'' <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomson </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Secondary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Principals </ORGANIZATION>, said after the 18-0 vote by the group's board of directors. The board voted to urge schools not to participate in ventures disguising commercials as learning programs and to oppose ads which students must watch or which replace instruction time. Although the program was n't mentioned, spokesman <PERSON> Lew </PERSON> <PERSON> Armistead </PERSON> said the vote was a reaction to plans for `` Channel One,'' a daily 12-minute news show including up to two minutes of ads. `` We think it's a premature response. The program has not even been aired,'' said <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Whittle </PERSON>, chairman and founder of <ORGANIZATION> Whittle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> LP </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Knoxville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>, which plans to test the show at six schools in early March. `` We're conducing an entire battery of research to find out what educational value it has, to find out the effects of commercials, if any, on teen-agers,'' he said in a telephone interview. <ORGANIZATION> Whittle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> gives schools about $ 50,000 of electronics equipment in exchange for an agreement that the satellite-carried program will be shown to students every day. <PERSON> Whittle </PERSON> said <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Cronkite </PERSON> told the association in 1980 that a daily news program should be beamed to high schools. `` He said the only question is funding. His attempt to do that, getting major corporations to put up the money, failed,'' said <PERSON> Whittle </PERSON>. `` Furthermore, let's find out what's the alternative plan,'' he said. `` Meaning, how do the critics expect education to be funded if new ideas are n't allowed to even be tested. `` If you're going to get real funding from business, business is going have to get real results,'' Whittle said. `` When you talk about small dollars, yes, maybe business is going to provide it. When you talk about real dollars, it's going have to be quid-pro-quo partnerships.'' <PERSON> Thomson </PERSON>, a former social studies teacher, said his major objection at first was the idea of bringing advertisements into the classroom. But after seeing a preview segment, he said, he was even more set against `` Channel One.'' `` After I reviewed the program, I became more concerned about the superficiality of the curriculum,'' <PERSON> Thomson </PERSON> said. `` It results in pop social studies. That's not the right way to get students to understand concepts and have basic information,'' he said.

 Are you ready for a comedy about big-gun classical composer <PERSON> Gustav </PERSON> `` Gus'' <PERSON> Mahler </PERSON> and his friendship with a modern-day playwright who is not unlike author <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> `` Al'' <PERSON> Innaurato </PERSON>? You'll get both of them in `` Gus and <PERSON> Al </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Innaurato </PERSON>'s strange comic fantasy that opened Monday at off-Broadway's Playwrights Horizons. <PERSON> Innaurato </PERSON>'s weird tale of time-travel begins in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> 1989 and then jumps backwards to <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> 1901. <PERSON> Al </PERSON>, who is fat, 40 and gay, has fled his problems in the present to help his hero <PERSON> Mahler </PERSON> confront difficulties in the past. And <PERSON> Mahler </PERSON> does have his troubles _ an overbearing sister as well as a mad housekeeper <PERSON> Natalie </PERSON> who is in love with him. She is jealous of his romancing the bossy <PERSON> Alma </PERSON> <PERSON> Schindler </PERSON> who later becomes his wife. Much of the bickering between the composer and his female entourage in Act 1 is tedious. <PERSON> Mahler </PERSON> or music buffs might find some fun in <PERSON> Innaurato </PERSON>'s inside jokes about the composer. Others may find it pretentious, especially when the playwright suggests there is a similarity between the two artists, both, according to <PERSON> Innaurato </PERSON>, unappreciated in their own time. The second act perks up considerably when <PERSON> Al </PERSON> meets <PERSON> Camillo </PERSON>, his Italian grandfather as a young man before he emigrates to <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. The link between past and future is forged sweetly and with a great deal of humor. It's a fascinating conceit and one that is more interesting than the rest of the play. <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Blum </PERSON>, padded with stuffing, turns the hefty and neurotic playwright into an appealing character. <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Tsoutsouvas </PERSON> as the driven composer is a model of the frustrated, unfulfilled artist, but his trio of female tormentors, <PERSON> Cara </PERSON> <PERSON> Duff-MacCormick </PERSON>, <PERSON> Christina </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jennifer </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Dyck </PERSON>, are all variations of the same unattractive shrew. <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON> turns <PERSON> Al </PERSON>'s ancestor into an attractive, common-sense individual in contrast to all the loonies swirling around him. Still, <PERSON> Innaurato </PERSON> has a fine sense of the bizarre, particularly when he is dealing with his frustrated playwright. `` <PERSON> Gus </PERSON> and Al'' would have been twice as good if only it had concentrated on half its title characters.

 Angry mobs across <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION> set fire to cars and buses, battled police and national guardsmen and looted hundreds of stores on Monday to protest increases in gasoline prices and transportation fares. The wave of riots injured at least 200 people alone in <LOCATION> Caracas </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Guarenas </LOCATION> shantytown 30 miles east of the capital, a police report said. Rioting broke out in at least seven cities and towns and independent reports estimated damage nationwide to be in the millions of dollars. Sackings continued in downtown <LOCATION> Caracas </LOCATION> at nightfall and public transportation ground to a halt, leaving about 100,000 commuters stranded, officials said. Many employees remained in their offices, while a pitched battle went on between police and looters. `` It is a popular uprising. There are riots everywhere. They are all furious,'' Metropolitan Police Inspector <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Lara </PERSON> <PERSON> Montilla </PERSON>, who commanded a police unit armed with shotguns in downtown <LOCATION> Caracas </LOCATION>, told an <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> reporter. All 6,000 policemen in <LOCATION> Caracas </LOCATION> were mobilized, said <PERSON> Alex </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON>, deputy police commissioner. Riots were reported across the country and authorities broadcast appeals for calm. No official figures were available on deaths or injuries. A 32-year-old pregnant woman was fatally shot in <LOCATION> Guarenas </LOCATION>, according to a reporter for the newspaper <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Voz </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> de </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guarenas </ORGANIZATION>, quoting police sources who gave no further details. Television showed rioting in <LOCATION> Maracaibo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cristobal </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Valencia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cruz </LOCATION>, among other cities. Police helicopters were seen flying over the capital trying to disperse rock-hurling mobs. In the downtown area of <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Silencio </LOCATION>, site of the <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> offices, almost all the stores were sacked. In the twin <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> <PERSON> Bolivar </PERSON> towers, home of several ministries, not one shop window was left intact. `` Every single business around here has been sacked and destroyed,'' said <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON> <PERSON> Carvajal </PERSON>, an AP reporter who has lived in <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION> since 1973. `` It is the worst I have ever seen.'' The outburst turned <LOCATION> Caracas </LOCATION> into one solid traffic jam. By all accounts, the violence occurring during the new administration of Social Democratic President <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Andres </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> was the worst this usually peaceful, oil-producing nation has suffered in decades. Interior Minister <PERSON> Alejandro </PERSON> <PERSON> Izaguirre </PERSON> warned in a national TV address that the government would not tolerate further public disorder. `` Burning buses and cars, lootings and sackings of shops are not the expression of a democratic society. We will not tolerate this,'' he said. He said the increases were `` not capricious, but mandated by necessity. ... The government was compelled to dictate economic measures given the seriousness of an unprecedented economic crisis.'' The <LOCATION> Caracas </LOCATION> bus terminal of Nuevo Circo -LRB- New Circus -RRB- became a battlefield between police and mobs. Officers fired tear gas. Rioters set cars and buses ablaze. Hundreds of passangers who were waiting for transportation to neighboring areas fled in panic. At nightfall the police had cordoned off the terminal area, where about 500 buses and taxis daily transport at least 100,000 commuters. Most of the commuters are workers who live in <LOCATION> Maracay </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Valencia </LOCATION>. The fury spilled over Monday morning as new transport fares went into effect, in many cases doubling previous bus rates, as a result of gasoline price increases of more than 100 percent. The round-trip fare between <LOCATION> Guarenas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Caracas </LOCATION> went up from 16 to 32 bolivars -LRB- roughly from 41 cents to 82 cents -RRB-. In monthly terms, it represents roughly a quarter of the minimum salary included in the economic package announced two weeks ago by the government of <PERSON> Perez </PERSON>, inaugurated on Feb. 2. The government hopes to end subsidies on such necessities as transportation, food and housing. `` We can not stand this. We are already half-starving. The new rates condemn us to eat nothing,'' said <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON>, 45, who works in a shop in downtown <LOCATION> Caracas </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>'s economy, prosperous during the 1970s, is now trapped in a deep recession because of persistently weak oil prices and a $ 33-billion foreign debt. The country is also set to sign this week a letter of intent with the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monetary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION> for a $ 1.5 billion credit. Around 120 people were injured, including 14 policemen, when looters formed human chains to face national guard units firing birdshot from armored cars, said reporter <PERSON> Igor </PERSON> <PERSON> Camacho </PERSON>. Three guardsmen were hurt by rocks thrown by students in <LOCATION> Merida </LOCATION>, more than 300 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Caracas </LOCATION>. Stores were trashed and vehicles set ablaze. `` It's an outright battle between students and the national guard,'' said <PERSON> Ramon </PERSON> <PERSON> Suarez </PERSON>, a reporter for the newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Frontera </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Merida </LOCATION>, home to the 10,000 students of the University of the Andes. Tanks patrolled the streets. Students took the state governor, <PERSON> Orlando </PERSON> <PERSON> Guttierez </PERSON>, prisoner for about an hour Monday when he approached rioters in an attempt to talk with them. The national guard, part of the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>, is used for internal security. In <LOCATION> Maracay </LOCATION>, 60 miles east of <LOCATION> Caracas </LOCATION>, rioting students told reporters to stay away or their cars would be burned, said <PERSON> Orolis </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> of the newspaper <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Siglo </ORGANIZATION>. She said students blocked land transport between <LOCATION> Caracas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Maracay </LOCATION>, threatening to burn buses and cars.

 As riots swept <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>, looters in <LOCATION> Caracas </LOCATION> braved police and army units patrolling the streets and seized their chance to raid hundreds of stores. `` We've got orders to arrest, not to kill,'' said a police officer. `` But that could change.'' The crisis facing the new government of President <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Andres </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> was the worst in 30 years of <ORGANIZATION> democratic </ORGANIZATION> rule in <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>. Hundreds of Venezuelans looted stores in downtown <LOCATION> Caracas </LOCATION>, blocks from government offices, breaking windows and carting off merchandise ranging from air-conditioners to jewelry. `` Government!,'' shouted a young man, warning others of the approach of a jeepful of rifle-toting police. Police fired in the air, but looters defied orders to stop and continued to rampage. They finally scattered into nearby buildings as gunfire continued. No figures emerged on injuries or arrests, but a police officer estimated at least 100 police were injured by rocks and home-made explosives. Television stations estimated 40 civilians were wounded in <LOCATION> Caracas </LOCATION> by birdshot fired by police. One looter carted away a washing machine. `` I'm doing this because everybody else is,'' he said. `` The last time I saw this was the 23rd of January, 1958, the fall of the dictator,'' said <PERSON> German </PERSON> <PERSON> Guedes </PERSON>, a toothless, old man, pulling on a new pair of shoes inside a building as firing persisted outside. Venezuelan strongman Gen. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> Jimenez </PERSON> was toppled in 1958, leading to 30 years of stable, democratic rule. A woman caught in the cross fire as she tried to get home complained that the looters were criminals taking advantage of what started out as a protest by students against increased public transportation tariffs. `` They're just criminals, robbing, burning. I've never seen anything this bad,'' she said, crying. Major avenues across the city, with buses blazing, looked like movie scenes of hell. Fires in poor neighborhoods in the hills on the outskirts of the city burned through the afternoon and evening. Sculptor <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Mendoza </PERSON> said residents of one wealthy neighborhood stood on street corners and exchanged impressions of the violence, the first time he'd seen people in the neighborhood come out of their houses to talk to each other. Police said they expected the government to declare a state of emergency, but observers said the looting and riots across the country caught officials by surprise. `` They do n't want to send out the national guard because they do n't want repression,'' said a police officer. But as he spoke, national guard riot troops with plastic shields patrolled a nearby street. `` The government does n't know how to respond. We've never had this kind of thing before,'' said a young man. When asked what he would do if the situation continued, he said he would probably join the looters.

 <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON>, the retired auto worker convicted of being the sadistic <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> death camp guard `` Ivan the Terrible,'' said Monday that he has n't given up hope three years after being deported to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. `` I feel OK ...

But you know I feel that everything will be OK because I'm the wrong man.'' <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON> became the first American sent to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to stand trial for <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> war crimes three years ago on Monday. Last April, he was sentenced to death after being convicted of being `` Ivan the Terrible,'' who operated the gas chambers at the <LOCATION> Treblinka </LOCATION> death camp in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON> is appealing the conviction. <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON>, a Ukrainian immigrant who settled in the <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION> suburb of <LOCATION> Seven </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION> after World War II, said it has been difficult for him to be separated from his family. He has spent the past three years in a <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> prison and six weeks ago his second grandchild was born. `` This is hard, and I already have -LRB- a -RRB- grandson and granddaughter -LRB- who -RRB- I do n't see,'' he said. `` I miss family; I miss my other friends; I miss all the people from <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION>. `` The world should be learning what is true ... the world knows ... I know the world knows already. Everybody prays for me, and I pray for myself, and I think God helps me show the truth.'' <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON>'s appeal has been delayed until next fall because one of his <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> attorneys committed suicide and another, <PERSON> Yoram </PERSON> <PERSON> Sheftel </PERSON>, is recovering from an eye injury he received when an Israeli Holocaust survivor threw acid at him. `` I worry about him -LRB- <PERSON> Sheftel </PERSON> -RRB- you know that it wo n't happen a second time,'' <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON> said. Family members are still attempting to raise money for <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON>'s defense and to find evidence that will help in his appeal. `` We're working as hard as ever every single day to get at the information that we know exists to prove his innocence,'' said <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON>'s son, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr </PERSON>.

<HEAD>Walesa Notes Round-Table Talk Problems</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> told a rally Monday that round-table talks with the government are at the halfway mark and `` new obstacles keep appearing every day.'' But he remained upbeat and he begged young Poles to show restraint. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> spoke to 7,000 people in southwest <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> in the latest of a series of appearances to build support for his still-outlawed Solidarity free trade union movement. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> expressed hope the government would make `` new, further-reaching political decisions'' necessary to allay the difficulties. In the meantime, he asked young people to use restraint when demonstrating, saying, `` I am begging you on my knees.'' The 1983 Nobel Peace laureate appeared to be referring to student unrest over the weekend. Young people demanding legalization of the banned <ORGANIZATION> Independent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Students </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, or <ORGANIZATION> NZS </ORGANIZATION>, clashed with police in <LOCATION> Krakow </LOCATION>. Authorities said 39 police were injured. On Monday, 2,000 student supporters of <ORGANIZATION> NZS </ORGANIZATION> rallied in front of <LOCATION> Krakow </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Jagiellonian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> and declared a 48-hour boycott of classes, said an opposition spokesman in the city, <PERSON> Zygmunt </PERSON> <PERSON> Lenyk </PERSON>. Negotiators in <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> meanwhile reported progress Monday on the question of legalizing the <ORGANIZATION> NZS </ORGANIZATION>, which is the campus equivalent of Solidarity, and which like Solidarity was banned after <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s 1981 martial-law crackdown. Both sides agreed to consider a declaration of intention to legalize the <ORGANIZATION> NZS </ORGANIZATION> and several other groups banned because of their support for Solidarity, said <ORGANIZATION> NZS </ORGANIZATION> representative <PERSON> Piotr </PERSON> <PERSON> Czerwiec </PERSON>. But government spokesman <PERSON> Jerzy </PERSON> <PERSON> Urban </PERSON>, appearing on state television, said legalization `` must depend'' on whether <ORGANIZATION> NZS </ORGANIZATION> leaders disassociate themselves from violent or anti-Soviet protests. Authorities have agreed in principle to restore legal status to Solidarity and to a parallel union for farmers, Rural Solidarity. The unprecedented round-table talks among representatives of authorities, the opposition and the official trade union alliance OPZZ began Feb. 6 and were expected to last about three more weeks. The talks aim for a new `` social contract,'' in which the opposition would promise social peace and participation in official institutions such as Parliament in exchange for legalization of Solidarity and adoption of other political and economic reforms. `` The round-table is midway, but new obstacles keep appearing every day,'' <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> told a legal rally in <LOCATION> Wroclaw </LOCATION>. `` It demands new, further-reaching political decisions. I believe that they will take place.'' Opposition negotiators in <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> expressed annoyance that <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> took action Friday on subjects that were still under negotiation at the round table.

<TEXT>
 Residents of a northwestern <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> city pleaded for anti-alcohol legislation Monday at the end of a 200-mile march to the state Capitol that was spurred by a fatal accident caused by a drunken driver. More than 1,000 people joined the couple dozen marchers and heard pledges of support from Gov. <PERSON> Garrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Carruthers </PERSON>, Gallup Mayor <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Munoz </PERSON>, Navajo Nation Vice Chairman <PERSON> Johnny </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> and others. Later, the state <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> heard a series of emotion-filled speeches and testimonials describing the alcoholism problem in Gallup, a city of about 18,000 peole in northwestern New Mexixo near the <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> border. `` We could walk from here to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and it would n't do a bit of good unless we had the support of the people to enact the laws,'' <PERSON> Munoz </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. The march, which began Feb. 17, was dubbed the Journey for <PERSON> Jovita </PERSON> after an infant who was killed in an alcohol-related traffic accident in January. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alcoholism </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alcohol </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Abuse </ORGANIZATION> has reported that surrounding <LOCATION> McKinley </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>'s rate of alcohol-related deaths per 100,000 people was nearly six times the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> average from 1975 to 1979. The marchers asked lawmakers to support anti-alcoholism legislation, including a liquor tax to fund alcohol-rehabilitation programs, funding for a detoxification program and a ban on drive-up windows at liquor stores. Although only a couple of dozen walked most of the 200-mile trip from Gallup to <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fe </LOCATION>, groups from Indian schools and pueblos and other <LOCATION> McKinley </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> residents joined the group for the final few miles to the Capitol.

 A <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> teen-ager was arrested Monday at a <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> shelter for runaway children and charged with the shotgun murder of his mother, whose body was found stuffed in a garbage can earlier this month. <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Reid </PERSON>, 18, of <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>, is also wanted for questioning in the disappearance of his stepfather, said <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> police Detective <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON>. Police believe the stepfather is dead, although his body has not been found and the teen has not been charged in that case. <PERSON> Reid </PERSON> was jailed pending his transfer to <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, said Detective <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Clifford </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> police spokesman. Authorities were unsure whether the teen planned to waive extradition proceedings or when he would be returned to <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>. The teen had spent the weekend at <ORGANIZATION> Covenant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, telling workers there his mother had died several months earlier of a heart attack and he did n't know where his father was, said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Kells </PERSON> of the shelter. `` He looked like the average runaway kid,'' said <PERSON> Kells </PERSON>. `` He did what the other kids do here on weekends _ read books, eat, sleep.'' <PERSON> Reid </PERSON> was arrested Monday after officials at the shelter near Times Square discovered he was wanted for murder and called city police, said <PERSON> Clifford </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> police contacted <ORGANIZATION> Covenant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> after staffers there called <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> to get background on <PERSON> Reid </PERSON>, said <PERSON> Kells </PERSON>. The teen-ager arrived at the shelter Friday, <PERSON> Clifford </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> police believe <PERSON> Reid </PERSON> shotgunned his mother, 37-year-old <PERSON> Marie </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> <PERSON> Dials </PERSON>, and stuffed her into a garbage can at an elementary school two blocks from their home, said <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON>. Her body was found Feb. 7, but she was not identified until eight days later. Police then searched the family's home and found evidence that the teen's stepfather, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Dials </PERSON>, 44, had also been killed, said <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON>. The search for his body continues, `` but we believe he is deceased,'' the detective said. A warrant was subsequently issued for <PERSON> Reid </PERSON>'s arrest. Family members told <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> police that <PERSON> Reid </PERSON> was `` fascinated with death, Satan worshipping and that type of thing,'' said <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON>. Police have not determined a motive in the slaying, he said.

<TEXT>
 Two brothers accused of masterminding a $ 1 billion operation to launder cocaine profits were honest gold bullion dealers, an attorney said Monday after winning postponement of their bail hearing. The lawyer for <PERSON> Nazareth </PERSON> <PERSON> Andonian </PERSON> told a magistrate that evidence indicating the two men's innocence should be considered before bail is decided. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Magistrate <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Kronenberg </PERSON> scheduled the bail hearing for next Monday. The government has asked that <PERSON> Andonian </PERSON> and his brother, <PERSON> Vahe </PERSON>, be held without bail on grounds that they were key figures in an international cocaine money laundering scheme centered in the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> wholesale jewelry mart. More than 40 persons have been arrested so far in the government investigation code-named Polar Cap, which was revealed last week. Defendants were charged with aiding the distribution of thousands of pounds of cocaine by laundering up to $ 1 billion in cash. The money, packed like bricks and shipped by armored car, was generated from cocaine sales in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> and other cities, authorities said. The complaint alleged the funds were counted, deposited in banks and wire transferred to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> for purchase of more cocaine. But attorney <PERSON> Allan </PERSON> <PERSON> Sigel </PERSON>, representing <PERSON> Nazareth </PERSON> <PERSON> Andonian </PERSON>, said outside court that the government may have been misled by informants in the drug trade. `` They have a snitch, an informant, who finds himself in great difficulty and in exchange for freedom will say anything,'' said <PERSON> Sigel </PERSON>. An affidavit filed in federal court shows that the probe of wholesale jewelers began with a tip from an informant in <LOCATION> Uruguay </LOCATION> who told an agent about the alleged money laundering operation. `` The complaint is inference and innuendo because of the government view that they -LRB- the Andonians -RRB- have large amounts of unexplained cash,'' said <PERSON> Sigel </PERSON>. But he added that, `` One who deals in gold bullion deals in huge amounts of cash. It's quite common to deal in millions of dollars in the gold business.'' Thus, he said that government surveillance videotapes which showed employees counting vast amounts of cash at <ORGANIZATION> Andonian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> may reflect legal activities. <PERSON> Sigel </PERSON> said he would show at the bail hearing next Monday that the Andonians were `` men of modest circumstances'' who made a legitimate living by brokering gold at a modest commission. He said the Andonians are worth less than $ 500,000 each, that each man owns a $ 250,000 home and `` they make car payments like the rest of us.'' He said the Andonians, American citizens who are of Lebanese and Syrian descent, have been active in community and church affairs and that religious leaders were anxious to vouch for them in court.

<TEXT>
 A <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> businessman testified Monday that he saw a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> sergeant take a bribe to release an overcrowded tourist boat on New Year's Eve that sank minutes later, killing 55 people. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Tripp </PERSON>, an electronics equipment dealer from <LOCATION> Beverly </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION> who was on the fateful cruise, told police he was `` certain'' he had seen one of cruise's organizers pay off a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> port authority official who stopped the vessel as it headed for a fireworks display on <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION>'s famous <LOCATION> Copacabana </LOCATION> beach. The double-decked Bateau Mouche IV was carrying an estimated 150 people, three under its legal limit, when it flipped over and sank minutes before midnight. A <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> report later said the boat could not safely carry more than 62 people. In a sworn statement given to Special Investigator <PERSON> Wladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> Sergio </PERSON> <PERSON> Reale </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> de </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Janeiro </LOCATION> state civil police department, <PERSON> Tripp </PERSON> said a Sgt. <PERSON> Braga </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Port </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION> was counting passengers when a fat bearded man named Mr. <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> gave him money. <PERSON> Francisco </PERSON> <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> <PERSON> Riveiro </PERSON>, an owner of the <ORGANIZATION> Itatiaia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Turismo </ORGANIZATION> travel agency that hired the Bateau Mouche IV for the cruise, was briefly arrested last month, along with the boat's owners, and then released. Also questioned at that time was Port Authority Sgt. <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Braga </PERSON> <PERSON> Vasconcellos </PERSON>, who boarded the boat for an inspection but denied taking money. The accident caused a national outcry and demands for the punishment of those responsible. The Bateau Mouche, which sold tickets at $ 220 apiece, tipped over amid what survivors said was overcrowding aggravated by rough water, with life preservers hard to find or tied down. The <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> de </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Janeiro </LOCATION> state government, which has vowed to aggressively prosecute the case, paid for a first-class round-trip ticket for <PERSON> Tripp </PERSON>, 40. <PERSON> Riveiro </PERSON>'s lawyer, <PERSON> Nilo </PERSON> <PERSON> Batista </PERSON>, said <PERSON> Tripp </PERSON>'s deposition `` was n't worth a second-class ticket on a train.

<HEAD>Seven Granted Asylum In First Week Of Rapid Processing Plan</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The first week of a crackdown on political asylum applications ended Monday with approvals granted to only 2 percent of those applying, federal officials said. Of 329 applications submitted here, seven have been approved for asylum since Tuesday, when the <ORGANIZATION> Immigration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Naturalization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> sped up its procedures for handling asylum applications. Under the new procedures, all applications are processed in a single day, but those whose applications are rejected are subject to immediate arrest and detention and are marked for deportation. All seven approved for refugee status are from <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, said <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kice </LOCATION>, spokeswoman for the agency's <LOCATION> Harlingen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> at the southern tip of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. Political asylum is granted to people who are judged to be fleeing persecution. The <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> instituted its new policy because it believes most of the emigrants are traveling to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for economic reasons. The number of applicants has plunged since the new get-tough procedure began. <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> examiners processed 233 last Tuesday, 51 Wednesday, 10 Thursday, 19 Friday and 16 Monday. Two weeks ago, when applicants still were able to travel on to their <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> destinations to pursue their cases, the agency was seeing 500 a day. Things have slowed down so much that some of the extra personnel brought in last week to carry out the new procedures went home Monday, said <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Leon </PERSON>, assistant district director for examinations. Twenty-six examiners left Monday, he said, leaving 24 here to process cases. One of two <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> personnel on hand since last week to issue advisory opinions on the cases left Thursday, according to the <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION>. Sixteen cases processed Monday resulted in 11 denials of asylum, four approvals and one notice of `` intent to deny,'' meaning that person was given 15 days to supply improved documentation to bolster a borderline case. An exact number of people affected by the decisions was unavailable because dependants sometimes file jointly with the principal applicant, Ms. <PERSON> Kice </PERSON> said. The number of people detained as a result of the new procedure was unavailable, but the inmate count at an immigration service detention center on Monday was double the population of a week ago.

<HEAD>New York to Begin Testing Departing Prison Inmates for AIDS</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The state will soon begin voluntary AIDS testing for convicts leaving the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> prison system, Corrections Commissioner <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Coughlin </PERSON> said Monday. Any inmate being released from prison can be tested at their request, under the program administered by the Corrections, Health and Parole departments, he said. The program is set to begin April 1. Currently, only inmates who exhibit symptoms of acquired immune deficiency syndrome or who are considered high-risk AIDS candidates may be tested voluntarily. Under the new program, any departing inmate who tests positive for the AIDS virus will be referred to counseling and health services, <PERSON> Coughlin </PERSON> said. The test is `` kind of a backhanded way of seeing if there is any -LRB- AIDS -RRB- transmission'' in the prisons, said the commissioner, who discussed the new testing program during a joint legislative hearing on the 1989-1990 prisons budget. <PERSON> Coughlin </PERSON> said he does n't believe AIDS is spread among inmates. `` I think there is sexual activity and I think there is drug abuse going on, ... but I do n't think that you're going to find massive transmission of the AIDS virus within the prison system,'' he said. The AIDS epidemic has not exploded within the prison system, as some people expected, <PERSON> Coughlin </PERSON> said. `` Everybody said four, five years ago that the prisons would have thousands and thousands of AIDS cases,'' <PERSON> Coughlin </PERSON> said. `` But it just has n't happened.'' The AIDS patient rate has remained constant, at about three per thousand, for three years, he said. There are now about 400 inmates with AIDS symptoms. <PERSON> Coughlin </PERSON> gave the AIDS education program for all inmates partial credit for averting an explosion of AIDS in the prisons. However, he said he's still preparing for an increase in inmate AIDS cases `` because of the number of drug abusers we have in the system.'' AIDS is caused by a virus that damages the body's immune system, leaving victims susceptible to infections and cancer. It is spread most often through sexual contact, needles or syringes shared by drug abusers, infected blood or blood products, and from pregnant women to their offspring.

 Two buses collided head-on in the outskirts of the capital Monday, killing 16 people and seriously injuring seven, after one of the vehicles struck a motorcyclist and lost control, police said. The motorcyle rider ran a stop sign and crossed the intersection in front of a small bus, whose driver tried to avoid the motorcycle but hit it. The bus careened into a full-sized bus coming in the opposite direction. Police said the small bus was traveling at excessive speed and carrying 22 passengers, five more than its legal capacity. All of those killed were riding in the smaller bus, as were all those seriously hurt, with the exception of the motorcyclist, police said.

 Three soldiers and seven Maoist guerrillas were killed when rebels ambushed an army truck on a mountain road near this state capital, officials said Monday. Five soldiers and `` numerous'' rebels were wounded in the fighting Sunday at an isolated spot in <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>'s southern highlands, a military communique said.

Civilian court officials said about 20 police and soldiers wearing hoods barged in after receiving information guerrillas were using it as a safe house. The local district attorney's office said it was not clear if the five young men were armed. Police and the military refused to provide information on the shooting. In other violence, police said Shining Path rebels on Monday killed the mayor of <LOCATION> Mantaro </LOCATION>, a district 20 miles north of <LOCATION> Huancayo </LOCATION>. They said two men and a woman shot <PERSON> Teodoro </PERSON> <PERSON> Tovar </PERSON>, a member of the governing center-left <ORGANIZATION> Aprista </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. A military communique issued in <LOCATION> Ayacucho </LOCATION> said the guerrilla ambush of the army truck occurred shortly before nightfall Sunday 20 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Ayacucho </LOCATION>. The provincial capital lies 235 miles southest of <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION>. The report said a truck carrying 15 soldiers to the nearby army post of <LOCATION> Julcamarca </LOCATION> was caught in a cross fire by about 50 rebels positioned on slopes above the road. The wounded were evacuated to <LOCATION> Ayacucho </LOCATION>, an old colonial town that was the birthplace of the Shining Path insurgency nine years ago.

 Mayor <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON> stepped up the pace of his campaign Monday, buoyed by late poll results showing him closing in on Democratic rival <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Daley </PERSON> one day before a court-ordered primary election. `` We're going to get our people to knock on doors all during the day today and tonight and tomorrow morning,'' <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON> said during a campaign stop at a <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Side </LOCATION> high school, one of at least 10 campaign events during the day. <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON>, the city's second black mayor, was joined by <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> at the school and at a South Side church. He also campaigned at a public housing project, two senior citizens centers and other spots. At the South Side church Monday night, the finale of <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON>'s primary campaign, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> tried to rally blacks by recalling the long struggle for the right to vote `` We died too young, bled too profusely and lost too many martyrs to not vote,'' he said. `` We stand tonight on the tombstone of the martyrs who paid not with the dollar but their lives for the right to vote. `` Vote for <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON> with a passion!'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Daley </PERSON> was busy, too. The son of legendary Mayor <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Daley </PERSON> visited restaurants, shook hands with commuters at elevated train stations and walked through neighborhoods in a frenetic final day of campaigining. `` I'm campaigning very hard,'' <PERSON> Daley </PERSON> assured reporters as he made one of more than 15 planned campaign stops. Tuesday's primaries in the nation's third-largest city are a step toward filling the vacancy left by former Mayor <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Washington </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>'s first black mayor, who died in November 1987. The <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> last year ordered the special election to fill the last two years of his term. <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON>, who was elected acting mayor by fellow aldermen days after <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s death, has been struggling to keep the seat. But as election day neared, he steadily closed on <PERSON> Daley </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Cook </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> state's attorney. Poll results released Monday showed <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON> 7 percentage points behind. Until the last two weeks, the campaign had been relatively free of the racial rancor that had marked recent mayoral elections. Since then, <PERSON> Daley </PERSON> has been accused of being a racist and <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON>'s camp made use of a videotape in which <PERSON> Daley </PERSON> appears to tell a predominantly white audience that `` you want a white mayor.'' <PERSON> Daley </PERSON> denied making the statement. His supporters say the candidate, who is well known for garbling his syntax, slipped and inserted an extraneous word that sounded like `` what,'' not `` white.'' The election marks the fifth time in two years that <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> voters have been called to the polls, and some residents appear to be turned off by the campaign. `` What they need to do is stop this black and white stuff and get a qualified person,'' said <PERSON> Sidney </PERSON> <PERSON> Turner </PERSON>, 43, an undecided voter. The <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> election is one of three mayoral elections taking place around the nation Tuesday. In <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Petersburg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, three challengers are trying to unseat Mayor <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Ulrich </PERSON> in a nonpartisan primary. And in <LOCATION> Wichita </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kan. </LOCATION>, where residents approved a change in the structure of city government last November, 16 candidates are vying in the first mayoral election since 1916. In <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Election </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commissioners </ORGANIZATION> predicted 68 percent of the city's 1,549,367 registered voters would go to the polls. Temperatures are expected to be in the 20s with a threat of light snow. Although early polls showed <PERSON> Daley </PERSON> far ahead of <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON>, both candidates said the latest results confirm what they maintained throughout the campaign _ Tuesday's vote would be close. `` This race is virtually tied up,'' <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON> campaign spokesman <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Horist </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Daley </PERSON> and <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON> are the top contenders in the four-way <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> primary Tuesday, while three candidates are running on the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> ballot. But the wild card in the race is former <PERSON> Alderman </PERSON> <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Vrdolyak </PERSON>, who bolted the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> after a 1987 third-party loss to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. He is running as a write-in candidate on the Republican ticket, and could give <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON> an edge by siphoning off white votes from <PERSON> Daley </PERSON>. Because of the difficulty of counting write-in votes, the outcome of the Republican race might not be known until Thursday, when the <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elections </ORGANIZATION> makes its final count. The winners of Tuesday's election will run in a general election April 4 to determine who will finish the final two years of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s second term. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s former <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> floor leader, <PERSON> Alderman </PERSON> <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>, will be running in that election as a third-party candidate, hoping to stake a claim to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s solid black voting bloc. The latest poll indicates that the electorate remains divided along racial lines. <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON> received the support of 73 percent of the black voters surveyed to <PERSON> Daley </PERSON>'s 8 percent. White voters split 79 percent for <PERSON> Daley </PERSON>, 14 percent for <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON>. Hispanic voters, who could hold the key to the election outcome, favored <PERSON> Daley </PERSON> by a 2-1 margin. Despite the polarization _ and some eleventh-hour racial controversy _ the election has been remarkable for its lack of racial animosity, many observers have said. `` I think that this campaign marks a real positive movement for the city,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> McDermott </PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> on Decent Unbiased Campaign Tactics, a watchdog group formed after the racially divisive 1983 elections that led to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> taking power. `` Despite the ... racial rhetoric in the past week, the number of incidents of ... appealing to bigotry or bias or using fear of the other group has declined considerably,'' <PERSON> McDermott </PERSON> said.

 Mayor <PERSON> Marion </PERSON> <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, hoping to reduce the number of drug-related murders in the nation's capital, on Monday proposed a mandatory five-year jail term for persons who use guns to commit crimes. `` We are going to launch an all-out assault on weapons in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> said at a news conference at a police warehouse where more than 15,000 weapons confiscated over the last several years are stored. `` We want to get tough on those who carry guns.'' <PERSON> Barry </PERSON>'s proposal, which will be submitted to the city council Tuesday, would toughen the city's current midemeanor gun law, which includes a maximum penalty of one year in jail and a $ 1,000 fine for those caught with unregistered weapons. <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> wants the city to pass the legislation on an emergency basis, which would enable the council to pass the bill as early as Tuesday. <PERSON> Barry </PERSON>'s bill also proposes redefining the city's bail laws so that those caught carrying an unregistered weapon, selling drugs or using a weapon in an assault could be denied pre-trial release. <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> wants to create a `` drug-free zone'' covering areas 1,000 feet or less from city schools. Under that bill, those caught using or selling drugs in those areas would face an additional three-year jail term. <PERSON> Barry </PERSON>'s gun proposal comes as the city is struggling to slow the pace of drug-related killings. Police blame about 60 percent of last year's record 372 killings on drugs. Thus far in 1989, 89 people have been killed in the district, 37 more than at the same time last year. Weapons seizures are also up. While 2,225 guns were taken by police on city streets in 1987, 3,863 were taken in 1988.

 A $ 3 million libel verdict against The <ORGANIZATION> Detroit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> has been reinstated by the <ORGANIZATION> Michigan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION>, which ruled in an opinion released Monday that somebody can be defamed by implication. Even if no specific sentence in a story is false and libelous, the court said in its 3-0 ruling, a lawsuit can be successfully brought over the full context of the article, including the headlines, photographs and page layout. `` You can libel someone by innuendo ... in the false impression that it creates,'' said <PERSON> Jeremiah </PERSON> <PERSON> Kenney </PERSON>, attorney for two men who sued the <ORGANIZATION> Evening </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, publisher of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Detroit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION>, and several reporters. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Locricchio </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Francell </PERSON> charged that a series of 11 articles in 1978 and 1979 `` falsely portrayed, implied and insinuated'' they had organized crime ties and were engaged in other criminal conduct in the development and operation of Pine Knob, an outdoor entertainment center northwest of <LOCATION> Pontiac </LOCATION>, the appeals court said. <PERSON> Kenney </PERSON> said in filing the lawsuit that the plaintiffs `` pointed to the totality of the articles'' which included implications of mob ties, two unsolved murders, and a series of illegal financial arrangements. A <ORGANIZATION> Wayne </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> jury awarded $ 3 million to Francell, but did n't give anything to <PERSON> Locricchio </PERSON>. Judge <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Connor </PERSON> subsequently dismissed the case, saying the men had n't proven the articles were false. <PERSON> Connor </PERSON> said that to find the inferences of the articles libelous was contrary to both <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> law and federal law. The appeals court, however, said the two men had a case even though their charges were n't based on a specific false statement in a particular article. The court said it believed that <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> law has not eliminated defamation by implication reinstated the jury award. <PERSON> Kenney </PERSON> said he did n't think the ruling upholding defamation by implication represented a new step in libel law. `` In our view, it has been the law in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> for many, many years,'' he said. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON>, an attorney for the News, said he disagreed with the ruling. `` We believe the decision is regrettable and wrong,'' he said. He said the ruling means that a person can sue successfully for libel despite stories being factually correct. He said lawyers would consult with newspaper officials on whether to appeal the case to the state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>.

 About five acres of burning tires continued to send smoke billowing into the air Monday, and the operator of the unlicensed tire dump contended that arsonists were to blame for the blaze. `` Have they caught the arsonist yet?'' asked <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>, owner of <ORGANIZATION> Casings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` Those tires sat there for a long time and they do n't set fire to themselves, so it has to be arson, right?'' <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> blamed opponents of the dump for the crisis. `` It was probably the townspeople who say they do n't want it here that started it.'' The tire dump has been operating without a license for the last year since landowner <PERSON> Dominick </PERSON> <PERSON> Valentine </PERSON>'s permit application was turned down. Valentine allows <ORGANIZATION> Casing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> to operate the dump on his property. No cause has been established for the fire, which began Saturday and forced the overnight evacuation of 200 families. While schools were closed Monday, stores near the fire reopened and there were no evacuations. Fire crews used heavy equipment to pull the tires apart in an effort to halt the fire's spread, and about 40 trucks brought in loads of dirt and cement dust to smother the flames.

 <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Democrats remained unmoved Monday in their opposition to <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tower </PERSON>'s nomination as <ORGANIZATION> defense </ORGANIZATION> secretary despite his unprecedented pledge to abstain from alcohol if confirmed. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> returned home declaring that he has n't `` wavered one iota'' in his support Moments before Air Force One touched down at <ORGANIZATION> Andrews </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told reporters that only `` time will tell'' as to whether <PERSON> Tower </PERSON> will win <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> confirmation. `` I do n't have any predictions nor do I plan to, except to say I have n't wavered one iota and I do n't intend to,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. Asked if Tower's pledge would help his cause, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> shrugged his shoulders and said, `` I do n't know.'' White House Chief of Staff <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> met with <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> senators and Vice President <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> on Monday night to discuss the embattled Tower nomination. After the meeting, Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Warner </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Va </LOCATION>., ranking Republican on the Armed Services panel, said there was no discussion about a withdrawal by Tower `` The strategy is to go all the way to the mat and there will be a vote.'' Senate Republican leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Kan </LOCATION>., who was also in the meeting, agreed `` There was n't any plug mentioned. No pulling of any plug.'' During the day, senators trekked to a special committee hearing room to read the latest <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> report on Tower, while those members the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration hopes to sway indicated they are either undecided or leaning against confirmation. White House spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>, speaking to reporters on Air Force One as <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> returned to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, said the president will meet with 12 senators beginning early Tuesday morning. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> declined to identify them but congressional staff said Sens. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Maine </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Robb </PERSON>, D-Va.; <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnston </PERSON>, D-La; <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.J. </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> DeConcini </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ariz </LOCATION>., were among those invited to the White House <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also telephoned <PERSON> DeConcini </PERSON> from aboard <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> One and urged him to reserve judgment until he had a chance to see all the evidence, according to the senator's staff. `` We're going to work real hard. We're going to talk to a lot of people and ask them to keep an open mind and to read the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> report and to talk to <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tower </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. Of Tower's pledge not to drink if confirmed, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said, `` I think it should help. It should take care of the drinking situation.'' Sen. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Graham </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Fla </LOCATION>., considered by some a swing vote, told reporters in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> that Tower's pledge helps but `` it's not just the drinking which is a problem to me. `` It's a pattern of bad judgment _ bad judgment in the 1970s in drinking, bad judgment by placing himself in compromising positions as the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> arms negotiator in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> in the mid-80s, bad judgment in accepting large sums from the defense industry in the late 1980s,'' <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> said. The Democratic-controlled <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> voted 11-9 along party lines last Thursday to recommend tha the full <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> reject the nomination, with panel chairman Sen. <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON>, D-Ga., citing Tower's drinking habits among other concerns Tower on Sunday sought to allay the fears of his former colleagues by issuing an extraordinary pledge not to take a single drink if he is confirmed. The full <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> is expected to take up the nomination Wednesday. Democrats hold a 55-45 majority in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, meaning <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> must pick up at least five Democrats and hold all Republicans to assure confirmation. Under that scenario, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> would break the tie. Those Democrats who hinted that they will oppose confirmation emerged from the special <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> hearing room saying that Tower's promise and a reading of the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> report did little to change their mind `` It's like marrying someone who says, ` Trust me, I'll reform,''' said Sen. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, D-Ill. `` You ca n't do that The experience with people who have problems with drink is that these pledges get broken much too easily.'' `` I have not heard of any vote changes as a result'' of Tower's pledge, said Sen. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Exon </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Neb </LOCATION>., an opponent of the He said the pledge could be a `` double-edged sword ... It might be interpreted that he wants the job too bad.'' Sen. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Daschle </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-S.D. </LOCATION>, said the pledge `` will have a marginal effect.'' And Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Breaux </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-La </LOCATION>., said he would vote against Tower if the vote were today `` If any senator has a serious doubt about the competence of a candidate, that he should err on the side of safety,'' said <PERSON> Breaux </PERSON>. `` In that case, it indicates voting negatively.'' The president flew home from his five-day <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> trip Monday and planned to meet with undecided Democrats in hopes of capturing enough votes for Tower. The administration is also faced with some wavering Republicans. Over the weekend, Sen. <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Kassebaum </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> said she was undecided and Sen. <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Pressler </PERSON> of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> said he would vote against confirmation. <PERSON> Robb </PERSON>, also undecided, said he was keeping `` an open mind.'' But he called Tower's action an `` astute move on his part. He addressed at least one of the outstanding questions.'' Sen. <PERSON> Howell </PERSON> <PERSON> Heflin </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>, one of several <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> still considered open to the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> lobbying effort, said he has `` to review all the evidence'' was trying to be `` open-minded, judicial and fair.'' Sen. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Pryor </PERSON>, D-Ark., said he admired Tower for his pledge and declined to disclose his decision But he said he does n't intend to read the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> report. Earlier this month, <PERSON> Pryor </PERSON> said Tower has `` become his own worst enemy'' and predicted that he would not be confirmed. Sen. <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Dodd </PERSON>, D-Conn., told a news conference in <LOCATION> Hartford </LOCATION> that he remains undecided and will make a decision after reading the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> report Republicans repeated their support for Tower with Sen. <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Helms </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.C. </LOCATION>, saying he did n't find `` anything more -LRB- in the report -RRB- than I've found so far'' and Sen. <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Bond </PERSON>, R-Mo., claiming that the pledge `` puts to rest any doubts about his capabilities or any impairment. The White House is preparing a version of the confidential <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> report for public release in hopes of demonstrating that allegations against Tower are baseless.

<DATELINE>BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> will hold its first presidential election, state-run television reported Monday, without saying when the ballotting will take place. The decision to hold a presidential election was originally made in 1980, but the war with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> which broke out in September that year forced postponement, the report said. Under <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s Constitution, the president and vice president are elected by the ruling nine-member <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>. The television said talks were under way to include a provision for regular presidential elections in a new constitution now being drafted by a special government committee. The committee is headed by <PERSON> Izzat </PERSON> <PERSON> Ibrahim </PERSON>, vice chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>. The government said Sunday a referendum will be held to approve the proposed new constitution and a new parliamentary election law, allowing new parties to form. General elections for the 255-member National Assembly, or parliament, are scheduled for April 1 after being delayed since August. The television gave no details about the decision to hold the presidential election. But it said President <PERSON> Saddam </PERSON> <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON>'s office notified a TV law program on the issue after a citizen asked, `` Why is the presidency a monopoly of the <ORGANIZATION> Baath </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>?'' No presidential election has taken place in <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> since the army overthrew the monarchy in a 1958 coup. After further coups, the <ORGANIZATION> Baath </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> ousted the military in a bloodless 1968 putsch with army Brigadier <PERSON> Ahmad </PERSON> <PERSON> Hassan </PERSON> <PERSON> al-Bakr </PERSON>, a former prime minister, named president. <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON>, his vice president after 1969, became president on July 16, 1979, after a peaceful transfer of power. The political developments came as <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> made tentative moves to liberalize <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> following the Aug. 20 cease-fire in the Iraq-Iran war. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> has a population of 16 million.

 The large drug seizures announced with fanfare by law enforcement authorities are having little effect on supplies on the street, with dealers simply absorbing them as a cost of doing business, federal officials say. `` Historically, a manager of drug couriers gives up one courier who is body carrying -LRB- drugs -RRB- to take your attention away from four more,'' said <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Norsworthy </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> agent at the <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Paso </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>. `` People walk away from a brand new aircraft after one load and consider that an expense of the trip,'' he said. `` The same goes for boats, automobiles, campers. They expect to pay a price.'' A better way to assess how the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is doing in the war on drugs is to ignore the ballyhoo about drug busts and concentrate on the price and purity level of drugs on the street, says Sen. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Biden </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, D-Del.

 Nearly a decade after the Three Mile Island accident, half those polled believe another serious nuclear power accident is likely, and eight in 10 people favor stricter safety standards. An Associated Press-Media General survey found support for continued use of nuclear plants now operating. But most opposed building new plants or starting up completed plants that are not yet in operation. Overall, 55 percent said they supported use of nuclear power to generate electricity. But 56 percent of the 1,162 adults polled said it is impossible to store radioactive waste from nuclear plants safely. And while most said the plants are safer now than a decade ago, 50 percent called an accident likely.

 After three frustrating years, Swedes hope the mystery behind the assassination of Prime Minister <PERSON> Olof </PERSON> <PERSON> Palme </PERSON> is finally solved and that his accused killer will soon be tried.

They acknowledge that crucial pieces of evidence are missing. If they have found a motive, they are n't saying.

 Neo-Nazis are preparing commemorations on the 100th anniversary of <PERSON> Adolf </PERSON> <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON>'s birth next month and West German officials are bracing for possible outbreaks of rightist violence. The Nazi dictator was born April 20, 1889, in the Austrian village of <LOCATION> Braunau </LOCATION> just over the border from <LOCATION> Bavaria </LOCATION>. `` This is the most important event we've had in a long time,'' said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Kuehnen </PERSON>, West German neo-Nazi leader. The preparations come as West Germans warily eye a rise in extreme-rightist sentiments in their country. In January, for example, the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> made a strong showing in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>'s elections by calling for the expulsion of foreigners and asylum-seekers Neo-Nazis from several countries are expected at the `` European <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON> convention'' specifically designed to commemorate the dictator's 100th birthday, but <PERSON> Kuehnen </PERSON> declined to specify exactly when or where it will take place. `` We do n't want to give the country time to gear up to prevent it,'' he said but added that <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Scandinavia </LOCATION> were possible places. Federal law bars such a meeting in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, although <PERSON> Kuehnen </PERSON> promises smaller birthday commemorations in the <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> area. The neo-Nazi leader, who often wears a brown shirt and black pants, said the number of participants at the <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON> convention could range from 1,000 to `` several thousand'' depending on the location. <PERSON> Kuehnen </PERSON>, whose organizing committee even has a logo with the initials `` AH'' in the center, insisted there will be no `` organized violence'' on the <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON> anniversary. `` But we are n't responsible for every young person and every soccer rowdy,'' the 33-year-old neo-Nazi added in a telephone interview. Fringe groups espousing neo-Nazi and rightist beliefs occasionally disturb professional soccer games in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Kuehnen </PERSON>, who has spent more than seven years in prison for neo-Nazi activities, has set up an office in <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> to organize the birthday event with the help of his followers. He's hoping neo-Nazis and right-wing extremists from <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION> as well as <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> will attend the European convention. Although the birthday falls in April, there were reports as early as January about plans for an observance in the West German news media. The newsmagazine <ORGANIZATION> Der </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Spiegel </ORGANIZATION> said on Jan. 30 that this year's celebrations are meant to attract public attention and distribute propaganda, in contrast to previous years In the past `` right-wing extremist cronies drank to the Fuehrer in the back rooms of German bars and in hotels of <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON>'s Austrian birthplace of <LOCATION> Braunau </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Der </PERSON> <PERSON> Spiegel </PERSON> noted. <LOCATION> Braunau </LOCATION> itself was the site of a clash between neo-Nazis and pro-Communists on <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON>'s 90th birthday in 1979. This past Jan. 22, the conservative <ORGANIZATION> Welt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> am </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sonntag </ORGANIZATION> newspaper said officials already were bracing for acts of violence and that Jews and foreigners were possible targets. <PERSON> Matthias </PERSON> <PERSON> Strohs </PERSON>, a spokesman on internal security issues for the <LOCATION> Baden-Wuerttemberg </LOCATION> state <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>, agrees that trouble could break out. `` There's no question _ you can count on acts of violence,'' he said. `` The possible targets range from foreigners, to German officials and allied military installations.'' Allies <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> drew the neo-Nazis' wrath for keeping <PERSON> Rudolf </PERSON> <PERSON> Hess </PERSON>, <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON>'s deputy, in prison until he died in what was officially determined as a suicide in 1987, although the Soviets were primarily responsible for rejecting pleas for clemency Strohs, speaking by telephone from his office in <LOCATION> Stuttgart </LOCATION>, said vandalism and pro-Nazi slogans painted on walls were also a possibility around the time of the birthday. The spokesman said officials assume older-generation <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION> will also commemorate <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON>'s birthday, but in a much less public way. `` The older ones are much more careful in the way they act,'' <PERSON> Strohs </PERSON> said. `` They wo n't make such a spectacle out in the public. It will be more of an internal affair.'' <PERSON> Alfons </PERSON> <PERSON> Metzger </PERSON>, spokesman for the Bavarian <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> also said `` violence ca n't be ruled out'' as a possibility on the <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON> birthday and that police are alerted to it. Several smaller neo-Nazi groups also routinely celebrate <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON>'s birthday, and are expected to do so again this year Federal officials say there are about 28,300 right-wing extremists in this country of 61.3 million people. The <ORGANIZATION> Deutsche </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Volksunion </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> German </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> -RRB-, identified by federal authorities as <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s largest right-wing extremist organization, has totally disassociated itself from the <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON> commemorations. `` We are convinced that on April 20, 1989, there will be several birthday celebrations for <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON>,'' said <PERSON> Bernd </PERSON> <PERSON> Droese </PERSON>, spokesman for the party, which claims a membership of 25,000. `` Fifty percent of them will take place in loony bins, where some people assert they are the reincarnation of the Fuehrer. `` The other 50 percent will be organized by agents and provocateurs who want to let the specter of the Fuehrer ghost wander around.''

<DATELINE>LA PAZ, Bolivia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Paz </PERSON> <PERSON> Estenssoro </PERSON> is in the final months of a presidency that brought a stability rarely seen before in <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s poorest nation. In a country that has had 75 governments in 163 years of independence, just completing a presidential term is accomplishment, and few other than <PERSON> Paz </PERSON> <PERSON> Estenssoro </PERSON> have been able to do it. Of the 75 governments, only 38 were constitutionally elected; the rest came about by military coup or some other unconstitutional manipulation or revolution. <PERSON> Paz </PERSON> <PERSON> Estenssoro </PERSON> himself led two revolutions, a leftist one in the 1950s and a conservative one three decades later. When he took office after the conservative one, <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION> was in the grips of a dizzying 24,000-percent inflation. It took 165,000 Bolivian pesos to buy one dollar's worth of goods and interest rates were soaring around 800 percent. <PERSON> Paz </PERSON> <PERSON> Estenssoro </PERSON> brought the economy back to its feet but to do so, he had to undo what he had done in his first revolution. His third presidential term ends Aug. 6, the 164th anniversary of independence from <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>. At 81, he plans to retire and turn the future of <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION>'s 6.7 million people over to the candidate who is elected in presidential balloting May 17. `` <PERSON> Paz </PERSON> <PERSON> Estenssoro </PERSON> wishes to be remembered as the man who was able to carry out two revolutions,'' said his minister of information, <PERSON> Herman </PERSON> <PERSON> Antelo </PERSON>. <PERSON> Paz </PERSON> <PERSON> Estenssoro </PERSON> first assumed the presidency in 1952, returning from exile at the end of a union-backed popular revolution that toppled a military government and shattered the oligarchic control of a small group of tin mining barons. His government was considered one of the most radical of its time in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. It nationalized the tin mines, gave peasants the right to vote and provided them with land by breaking up large estates. He lost in the 1956 elections but returned to office by winning the vote four years later. He completed that term and was re-elected, but toppled in a military coup in late 1964. Twenty one years later, in 1985, he again became president, this time on a conservative platform. He said times had changed, and a new approach was needed to solve <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION>'s problems. He dismantled the state mining monopoly he had created, modernized the economy and successfully challenged the authority of leftist labor unions that flourished during the 1952 revolution. `` The courage and commitment demonstrated by <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION> under the presidency of <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Paz </PERSON> <PERSON> Estenssoro </PERSON> are exemplary and certainly under-appreciated abroad,'' <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gelbard </PERSON> said in an interview. `` No other democratic government in <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> has demonstrated the resolve to undertake a program of fundamental structural change and then to stick by it.'' When he began this latest term, the staggering economy had led to widespread social unrest and virtually all foreign economic assistance had been cut off. His government prescribed harsh remedies. The currency was devalued by 94 percent, all price supports were lifted, wages frozen and 17 of the 21 government-run mines were shut down as highly unprofitable. Of the nation's 26,500 miners, 21,000 lost their jobs. While the Bolivian Workers' Central maintains that most of the fired miners remain unemployed, Information Minister <PERSON> Antelo </PERSON> said some 18,000 have found other work. In all, 35,000 government employees were dismissed. The Workers' Central responded to the austerity measures with a general strike but <PERSON> Paz </PERSON> <PERSON> Estenssoro </PERSON> broke it by declaring a state of seige and sending labor leaders to internment camps. By 1988, inflation had plunged to 21 percent. Labor unrest has eased, in part because of an emergency public works program launched with $ 100 million in aid from the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> governments. The country now enjoys a renewed, steady flow of foreign aid. To stop corruption, outside agencies were hired to handle government purchases and contracts. French and English companies have been put in charge of imports, certifying their quality and collecting duties. The tax system was overhauled and computerized, and tax revenues have tripled in three years. Ambassador <PERSON> Gelbard </PERSON> said <PERSON> Paz </PERSON> <PERSON> Estenssoro </PERSON>'s program `` could serve as a model for other countries struggling with the burdens of a statist tradition. Despite the formidable problems that the country still confronts, the chances of <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION> generating consistent economic growth and consolidating its hold on democracy are very good.'' The reforms have carried a steep social cost, however. Malnutrition and illiteracy still plague most of <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION>'s largely Indian population The minimum monthly wage is the equivalent of $ 40, while the prices of most food products are comparable to those in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Unemployment hovers above 20 percent but is declining. `` The government's economic policies have led to starvation wages for the working class,'' charged <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> <PERSON> Reyes </PERSON>, secretary general of the Workers' Central. He claimed the government had capitulated to the demands of the international banking community, while factories are closing and workers' earning power is shrinking.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Edmond </PERSON> <PERSON> Naim </PERSON>, governor of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>, is in the unique position of holding the purse strings of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s rival Christian and Moslem governments. But he's a virtual prisoner in the bank building where he has lived for 19 months. <PERSON> Naim </PERSON> is a <ORGANIZATION> Maronite </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> and the bank is in Moslem west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. For him to leave could be dangerous. The bank nonetheless is the only government institution that remains intact in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s 5-month-old political crisis, which has split the government, the army and every other department down the middle. This has given the 70-year-old <PERSON> Naim </PERSON> unprecedented powers. He said he bankrolls `` the basic needs'' of both governments, including food and fuel imports, to prevent a complete collapse of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s fractured public services. In June 1987, when Prime Minister <PERSON> Rashid </PERSON> <PERSON> Karami </PERSON> was assassinated, <PERSON> Naim </PERSON> moved into the bank headquarters and has never left. `` It's more practical to live in the bank,'' he said in an interview in his plush sixth-floor office. `` The streets are n't safe. So now he lives in a two-room apartment atop the seven-story building, which is guarded by 50 policemen. `` I cook, wash my dishes, do my laundry and tend my plants there,'' <PERSON> Naim </PERSON> said. His wife travels from the family home in <LOCATION> Christian </LOCATION> east <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> `` every two weeks for a weekend with me at the bank,'' <PERSON> Naim </PERSON> said. Mrs. <PERSON> Naim </PERSON>, the former <PERSON> Hedda </PERSON> <PERSON> Hofer </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>, is a naturalized American of German descent. The political crisis that began in September, when President <PERSON> Amin </PERSON> <PERSON> Gemayel </PERSON>'s six-year term expired with no successor elected because of sectarian bickering, left <PERSON> Naim </PERSON> the man in the middle. <PERSON> Gemayel </PERSON> named his Maronite army commander, Gen. <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>, to head a caretaker military Cabinet until a new president was elected. Moslem and leftist factions refused to recognize <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> and backed acting Premier <PERSON> Salim </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoss </PERSON>, a Sunni Moslem. `` The central bank finances the whole of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> according to a formula of equality and in line with the population and area each of the governments rules,'' <PERSON> Naim </PERSON> said. `` <PERSON> Naim </PERSON>'s the only official in this country behaving like a father to all the Lebanese,'' said <PERSON> Adnan </PERSON> <PERSON> Badra </PERSON>, a Sunni businessman in west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. Although <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s economy is in peril after nearly 14 years of civil war, the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> has gold reserves estimated at about $ 5 billion, with $ 800 million in foreign currency. <PERSON> Naim </PERSON>, a lawyer and former university dean brought out of retirement in 1983 to run the bank, has shown that he will not be bullied by political pressure from either side. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> has sought to impose his <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> government's authority on the bank. In December he closed the only crossing between east and west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> for 10 days after <PERSON> Naim </PERSON> allocated funds to Moslem army units. <PERSON> Naim </PERSON> responded by providing the equivalent of $ 1 million dollars to the Moslem side to import flour because <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s blockade choked off supplies from the main warehouses in east <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Naim </PERSON> has also had to contend with a serious banking crisis. The <ORGANIZATION> Al-Mashrek </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> went under in December because of a run by depositors panicked by reports it was overstretched through hefty investments. The <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>, however, underwrote claims by its non-institutional depositors. `` By law, we were not obliged to do what we did,'' <PERSON> Naim </PERSON> explained. `` It's not our duty ... to aid banks in trouble. But we intervened, not just to help <PERSON> Al-Mashrek </PERSON>, but to protect the banking sector and Lebanese society.'' By Feb. 15, the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> had covered claims for 7 billion Lebanese pounds -LRB- $ 14 million -RRB- and the equivalent to $ 17 million in foreign currencies, <PERSON> Naim </PERSON> said. `` But for <PERSON> Naim </PERSON>, I'd have lost my life savings when <PERSON> Al-Mashrek </PERSON> went under,'' said <PERSON> Badra </PERSON>, the Sunni businessman. `` I had all my money in <LOCATION> Al-Mashrek </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Ahmad </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabbou </PERSON>, a Moslem vegetable merchant. `` When I heard it had collapsed, I felt that 30 years of hard work was lost. `` When <PERSON> Naim </PERSON> announced that the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> would guarantee <PERSON> Al-Mashrek </PERSON>'s deposits it was like giving life to a dead man.''

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>, volunteer adviser to just about every president he has known, has some foreign policy counsel for President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>: deal warily with <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> or risk `` being taken to the cleaners.'' `` His toughness and intelligence will more than compensate for his country's economic weakness,'' <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> says of the Soviet leader, `` and his consummate ability in diplomacy and political maneuver will guarantee that he seldom winds up with the short end of a deal.'' The former president, who made his imprint in foreign policy before he was driven from office by the Watergate scandal in 1974, has been offering counsel on his speciality ever since. His 1989 installment is in an essay written for the weighty magazine `` Foreign Affairs.'' In it, he seconds <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s slow and cautious approach to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. `` President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> should continue to reject the advice of those who urge that he schedule a quick summit with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> in order to have a foreign policy ` victory' early in his term,'' <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> writes. `` <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> needs a summit far more than the president. `` Only when the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration has agreed on a strategy with our allies and has a definite program for making significant progress on major issues should President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> schedule an American-Soviet summit.'' <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> says that having met twice with <PERSON> Nikita </PERSON> <PERSON> Khrushchev </PERSON>, three times with <PERSON> Leonid </PERSON> <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON> and with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> in 1986, he considers the current Soviet leader `` in a class of his own. `` He is their match in tenacity and forcefulness, but outstrips them in realism, quickness and intelligence.'' <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> writes that `` if Western leaders want to avoid being taken to the cleaners, they must understand what <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> wants and how the West should respond.'' <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> says the new administration should link strategic arms control negotiations with economic relations, Soviet involvement in places like <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>, conventional arms reductions and other issues that divide the super powers, and take a package approach in dealing with <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. `` Without linkage, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> will string together a series of easy victories at the bargaining table,'' he says. <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> says that <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and the Western alliance should be the top foreign policy priority for the new administration. `` It should call for a major working summit _ no black ties and no spouses _ to hammer out a strategy for enhancing our collective security,'' he writes. <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> was <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>'s first overseas stop as president 20 years ago, although black ties and spouses were included on that journey to five allied capitals. Then, as now, there were strains on the <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> alliance. In <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>'s time, it was the decision of <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Gaulle </PERSON> to pull <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> out of the military side of the alliance The current problem is in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, and the issue is modernization of short-range nuclear weapons based there. <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> writes that one of <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s goals will be `` to separate the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> from, <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, particularly <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> ...'' Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> handled the new administration's first mission to <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, covering 16 nations in eight days. He returned saying that the nuclear modernization question can be worked out and resolved over the next three months. <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> also sees a new relationship with <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> as a major item on the <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> agenda. He said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> should welcome closer relations between the two communist giants. `` We can be confident that, since <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s top priority remains economic development, our relations with <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> will continue to be closer than the <ORGANIZATION> Kremlin </ORGANIZATION>'s,'' he says. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> knows that territory. He served as <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> envoy to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> for the <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> administration. He went back as president last weekend. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> plans a visit to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> in May. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told Chinese leader <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaoping </PERSON> that the summit with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> would be useful in bringing stability to the area and the world, and would not affect <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> relations with <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> calls <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> the central focus of East-West conflict now. He says the West needs a new strategy to strengthen <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> and at the same time foster peaceful change in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. `` <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Macmillan </PERSON> once told me that alliances were held together by fear, not love,'' <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> writes. `` For many in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, the fear of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has waned, and what love may exist between economic competitors in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> is a very weak glue to hold an alliance together.''

<HEAD>Inflation's Greased Pig</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The cost of health care is the greased pig of inflation fighting, forever slipping from the grasp of those who seek to wrestle it under control. No matter what strategy is used the beast eludes it. Penned in, it leaps the fence. Seemingly winded, it charges tormentors, scattering them and their ideas and strategies. It has left some of the best minds in health care, government, labor, think tanks and corporations feeling incompetent and frustrated. New approaches are developed each year. Almost invariably, they too end up spattered in mud. For decades it has been that way. From 1967 to 1984, the medical care segment of the consumer price index quadrupled, despite attempts at control. The <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> budget in 1970 was $ 47.7 billion; this year it will be eight times that. In all, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> spending on health care reached $ 500.3 billion last year, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, a New York-based business research group. That was up 10 percent from the year before, or more than double the general rate of consumer price inflation. The increase continues this year. The sharp, six-tenths of one percent rise in the January consumer price index included a major contribution from medical care. That segment led the advances, rising eight-tenths of a percent. The increase is showing up in business costs too. Much of the recent jump in private employment costs has been caused by the rising level of expenditures for employee benefits, which increasingly are health related. The big health care bills result not only because of specific cost increases, such as in doctor's fees, but also because the number and variety of health care products is expanding. It is a growth industry, a blue chip. Even success does not help matters. Some diseases become more prominent or vitally important as more people live to ripe old ages. New technology helps overcome problems, but almost always raises costs. There are surprise factors in the problem. AIDS, for example, was hardly anticipated. And few medical people foresaw the incredible spread of substance abuse, the cost of which might account for 3 percent of corporate payrolls. That estimate was made by a consulting firm, <PERSON> Mercer </PERSON> <PERSON> Meidinger </PERSON> <PERSON> Hansen </PERSON>, after surveying corporate chiefs, governors and mayors. And 81 percent felt the problem will worsen if more public resources are n't devoted to solutions. The rampaging cost of health care has been the subject of so many studies that very little about causes is left unknown. Inefficiency of delivery probably is the most commonly mentioned factor, with critics zeroing in on practices that are considered wasteful in a business sense. Many of these deficiencies, however, already have been corrected. Third-party payments have been cited as a cost factor, the assumption being that -LRB- 1 -RRB- individuals are more likely to use medical services if they are paid for by insurance, and -LRB- 2 -RRB- hospitals and others dispensers of medical services might be less inclined to curb charges when insurers are footing the bill. For a time, insurers also were blamed, the accusation against them being that they readily acquiesced to higher prices, seldom challenging hospitals or doctors. That has changed, however, in the past decade or more. A raised level of health consciousness, once viewed as a partial solution, is sometimes cited as a contributant, the rationale being that to retain good health those most concerned are likely to avail themselves of medical services. But the most basic of all reasons is one unique to health care. It is the matter of human mortality and the public's inability to put a price on life _ to answer the question of who should live and who should be allowed to die. Modern technology can extend indefinitely the lives of many terminally ill people, but at an enormous price. That price puts a lid on goods and services in all other markets _ on what people will pay for a car, for example. But how do you apply it to life?

 Carnaby Street, which soared to fame as the fashion pacesetter for Beatles generation of the Swinging Sixties, is seeking a new incarnation as a mecca for stylish yuppies of the 1980s. When <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Quant </PERSON>'s miniskirts and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON>'s bell-bottom hip-huggers clothed the flower children, <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> became the fashion capital of the world and Carnaby Street the favorite haunt of the Mods and Rockers. For about a decade, young people from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Sydney </LOCATION> flocked to boutiques called <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Cat </PERSON>, Take 6, and Lord <PERSON> John </PERSON> to buy the latest in hot pants, platform shoes, wide floral ties and psychedelic shirts. But as styles changed and rents soared in the early 1970s, <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> and other designers moved out and Carnaby Street took on a tacky down-market flavor. The street remains a microcosm of English fashion over the last 20 years: Shoppers can buy the'60s Mod look,'70s hippie and ethnic fashions and'80s punk leather and sado-masochistic gear including studded leather belts, Sex Pistols T-shirts and neo-fascist and Nazi-symbol buttons. Now the <ORGANIZATION> Peachey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Property </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, the private real estate company that owns about three-quarters of <LOCATION> Carnaby </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Street </LOCATION>, wants to restore some fashion magnetism to the two-block thoroughfare tucked behind <ORGANIZATION> Regent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Street </ORGANIZATION> in the heart of central <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. `` We're not trying to revive the'60s,'' said <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Bourne </PERSON>, <PERSON> Peachey </PERSON>'s surveyor for Carnaby Street. `` What we are aiming to do in <LOCATION> Carnaby </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Street </LOCATION> is cater to the better-off young market, the 15-30 age group who, like the young kids in the'60s, had no shops catering to them, especially in central <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>.'' Over the last two years, <PERSON> Peachey </PERSON> has replaced about half of the shops that sold this fashion mish-mash with branches of pricier, fashion chains like <ORGANIZATION> Benetton </ORGANIZATION>, Supreme, <LOCATION> Capricorn </LOCATION>, Confetti and Midas. The Nazi-insignia merchants have proved such an embarrassment that the two main stores, on an alley off <LOCATION> Carnaby </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Street </LOCATION>, are being forced out of business under pressure from <PERSON> Peachey </PERSON>, Westminster borough authorities and anti-fascist campaigners. <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Quant </PERSON>, who worked out of the King's <LOCATION> Road </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Chelsea </LOCATION> in the 1960s, has opened her first shop on Carnaby Street, selling makeup and accessories. She said she was lured by the revival of the surrounding <LOCATION> Soho </LOCATION> area as a center for young people and young industries. <PERSON> Bourne </PERSON> hopes the whole street eventually will be yuppified with wine bars, restaurants and art galleries. `` It does take a long time to move a whole area around,'' he said in an interview. `` Not only do we have to change tenents, but we have to tell the world this area has changed.'' Last June, <PERSON> Peachey </PERSON> relaunched Carnaby Street with balloons, 20,000 leaflets and the message that it was now `` synonymous with chic and stylish <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>.'' This year, it hopes to start regular street theater and entertainment and stage fashion and art shows. Knitwear designer <PERSON> Marion </PERSON> <PERSON> Foale </PERSON>, who moved into <LOCATION> Carnaby </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Street </LOCATION> in the early 1960s and did clothes for the Beatles, remembers when it was a quaint backwater where you could get a saddle mended. `` Now, it's beginning to come up again,'' she said. `` But it's always different ... The next Carnaby Street will have its own incarnation.'' But many shoppers, designers and storekeepers mourn the Carnaby Street they say is gone forever. `` It's an interesting historic relic. It's where it all started,'' said Los Angeles-born Giffi Fields, who started selling hand-painted, made-to-measure men's clothes to Carnaby Street shops in the late 1960s. `` Carnaby Street was a one-off -LRB- one-of-a-kind area -RRB- at its time because it was a street devoted to youth culture,'' he said. `` Every major city in the world today does n't have only one street, but many streets devoted to youth culture. So you just do n't get the uniqueness anymore and you wo n't get the uniqueness.'' At <LOCATION> Inderwick </LOCATION>'s pipe shop, a Carnaby Street landmark for at least 70 years and the only store left from the 1960s, owner <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> doubted <PERSON> Peachey </PERSON> would succeed because the street is getting the same stores as dozens of other shopping areas in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. `` Most shops are multiple or franchises. Not one shop has individual character except The Great Frog, because they make their own jewelry,'' said the 64-year-old businessman. `` I ca n't see it ever becoming what they're aiming for. It's still a street without any character. Shopkeepers at both ends of the market are unhappy with Carnaby Street's current clientele. Those at the top said the street was still attracting the same customers it did in 1975 _ young people looking for cheap clothes. But those at the bottom complained that the punks, Mods, skinheads and hippies had gone and the street was attracting too many straight people in suits. Potential shoppers wandering along the street recently were also unimpressed. `` It's just like a pedestrian walkway with tacky shops on either side,'' complained <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> <PERSON> Sawkins </PERSON>, 30, a student and motorcycle courier. `` It's just a tourist trap. Most people from <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> would n't come here.'' <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Tate </PERSON>, 20, a student from <LOCATION> Manchester </LOCATION>, said: `` It's gone downhill. It's too respectable now. The businessmen have taken over. It tries to be anarchic and anti-establishment, but it does it all commercially so it's not unique.''

<HEAD>Second-Hand Shops Flourish as Norway's Economic Slumps</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DOUG MELLGREN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>OSLO, Norway (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A slumping economy is sending Norwegians on bargain hunts in junk shops and second-hand stores. When <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> oil wealth flowed, Norwegians spent freely in an economy that quickly became overheated, but the boom came to an abrupt end two years ago when oil prices plunged. `` Business is booming,'' said <PERSON> Leon </PERSON> <PERSON> Andersen </PERSON>, who runs a <ORGANIZATION> Salvation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> shop in the city of <LOCATION> Stavanger </LOCATION>. `` It's better than ever. So far this year sales are up 30 percent compared to last year. `` People come here looking for everything from used clothes to furniture. They're being more careful with their money. `` We just may run out of used merchandise. People seem to be holding onto their things. They make do with an old couch for another year or use an old dress another season.'' <LOCATION> Stavanger </LOCATION>, the nation's oil capital on the west coast, was hardest hit by the collapse of oil prices in 1986, but the drop in national income has squeezed the whole country. With its offshore oil fields pumping 1.44 million barrels a day, lower crude prices quickly chilled <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION>'s overheated economy. Tough measures, including legislated wage controls, have helped reduce inflation and the trade deficit. But unemployment doubled in the last year to 4 percent, the highest since the 1930s, and thousands of businesses went broke. The government decisions, combined with a modest recovery of oil prices, hold out promise for the future, but it may take time before it is felt in the household budget. `` Many Norwegians may be willing to lower their standards a little compared to 1986,'' said <PERSON> Oddbjoern </PERSON> <PERSON> Eiden </PERSON>, an economist for the Confederation of Norwegian Business and Industry. He said consumer spending declined 1.6 percent in 1988 after dropping 2.7 percent in 1987. In 1986, the peak of the oil boom and spending spiral, consumption leaped 5.7 percent. `` It's hard to say why people would buy more used merchandise,'' said <PERSON> Oddbjoern </PERSON> <PERSON> Knutsen </PERSON> of the state Institude of Social Research. He said it was possible that Norwegians were simply returning to a normal state of affairs. `` I do n't think the spending spree of mid-1980s was typical. Oil resulted in an economic growth that was without equal in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION>. And people spent money freely,'' he said. `` It's more typical of Norwegians to be careful with money. If they are indeed buying more used things and not discarding as much, then it seems we are returning to the cautious ways of the 1950s and 1960s, when <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION> was not a rich nation.'' <PERSON> Arne </PERSON> <PERSON> Johansen </PERSON>, who works for <LOCATION> Oslo </LOCATION>'s five-store Elevator thrift shops, said he noticed an upswing in sales just after the economic slump began. `` We have n't noticed much of an increase since 1987 at any of our stores individually. Sales are pretty stable. But a lot more used merchandise shops have opened in <LOCATION> Oslo </LOCATION> during the past year or two,'' he said. `` Business is up,'' said <PERSON> Willy </PERSON> <PERSON> Olsen </PERSON>, who has owned <LOCATION> Oslo </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Willy </PERSON>'s Used Merchandise for 22 years `` But a lot of new stores have opened. There must be 10 that opened in the past two years.'' Twenty-nine thrift shops are listed in the telephone book for <LOCATION> Oslo </LOCATION>, a city of 425,000.

 Alphabetically speaking, <LOCATION> Yuba </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, was used to being last on lists. But catching the caboose in Rand McNally's `` Places Rated Almanac'' four years ago insulted residents right down to their toes. At first, they fumed, they raged, they stamped their collective civic feet. Then they got smart. City leaders decided `` there are only two places to be on the list: the top _ and the bottom,'' said <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Knapp </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Yuba-Sutter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> executive vice president. `` It depends what you make of both of them.'' What <LOCATION> Yuba </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Citians </LOCATION> made from last place was a heap of first-rate public relations hay. In the 50 years since one <PERSON> E.L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Thorndike </PERSON> created his `` goodness index'' for <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> cities, academicians, special interest groups, magazines and the federal government have cranked out a plethora of rankings identifying the best of all possible towns. Stressed out? Live in <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, says one survey; <ORGANIZATION> Cedar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rapids </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, says another. Best place for a hip, contemporary career woman? <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>, Savvy magazine says. Easiest place to make friends? <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Forbes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> magazine </ORGANIZATION> says. No. 1 overall? It's <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>, says one survey; <LOCATION> Danbury </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, says another. In a nation where everybody loves the underdog but nobody wants to be one, where everyone says it does n't matter what other people think but no one believes it, city ratings have become a source of indignation, elation, frustration and, always, fascination. Now, it's almost time for another edition of `` Places Rated,'' the most objective and carefully researched of the bunch. Like the presidential election, it appears every four years _ and a lot of people do n't like the results. The fallout has included threatened lawsuits, map and magazine burnings and, on a number of occasions, campaigns for civic improvements. But ask researchers, city officials and municipal groups what city rankings mean, and how seriously to take them, and the answers seem to be not much, and not very. `` There's no best city, just like there's no best work of art,'' said <PERSON> Bert </PERSON> <PERSON> Sperling </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ore. </LOCATION>, computer researcher who, despite that opinion, created software that rates cities. `` Who's to say <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Gogh </PERSON>'s ` Sunflower' is better than -LRB- da <PERSON> Vinci </PERSON>'s -RRB- ` The Last Supper'?'' And who's to say there are 328 better places to live than <LOCATION> Yuba </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>? Why, `` Places Rated'' authors <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Savageau </PERSON> and <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Boyer </PERSON>, that's who. When <LOCATION> Yuba </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> leaders reflected on how to make the best out of being the worst, they decided to lighten up. `` If you screamed and ranted and raved, you made a fool of yourself,'' <PERSON> Knapp </PERSON> said. `` We decided to make a fun thing of it.'' First, 1,000 residents burned hundreds of Rand McNally maps at a community pep rally, packaged the ashes in a walnut box and had a local mortician present them to a Rand <PERSON> McNally </PERSON> vice president, who flew out from <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> just for the occasion. Then the city helped a radio station in <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION> _ rated No. 1 in the same survey _ award an all-expense paid trip to <LOCATION> Yuba </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> as a contest prize. The happy winners toured the city by limousine and rode a float in the 105th Annual Bok-Kai Festival. A good time was had by all. And at year's end, when <ORGANIZATION> Life </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> magazine </ORGANIZATION> wrapped up 1985, it was <LOCATION> Yuba </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, not <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>, that received a full page. `` And they spelled the name right,'' <PERSON> Knapp </PERSON> mused, a little amazed. It took `` Places Rated'' to not only rocket <LOCATION> Yuba </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> out of obscurity but to propel the metro ratings game onto the best-seller list. The idea sprang from the authors' desire to move out of <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> and their discovery that there was no single source for good, solid data on life in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> cities. They decided to compile a comprehensive American cities reference guide, and sold Rand <PERSON> McNally </PERSON> on the idea in 1978. The first edition, with <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> at the top and <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, in the cellar, came out in 1981. More than 300,000 book sales later, <PERSON> Savageau </PERSON> says he's a bit disappointed that the book is considered more the topic of cocktail party chitchat than the serious reference tool the authors intended, and he acknowledges its popularity still baffles him. `` I would n't go out and buy a book that said <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION> was the best place in the country,'' he said, taking a rare break from his computer and the latest edition of `` Places Rated,'' due out this fall from <ORGANIZATION> Simon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Schuster </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, which acquired the series last year from Rand McNally. When the statistics laid the exalted mantel of extreme livability on <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>, a city once known as `` hell with the lid off,'' even <PERSON> Rand </PERSON> <PERSON> McNally </PERSON> did n't believe it at first. The crowning of <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION> illustrates the key difference between `` Places Rated'' and other city rankings. The Savageau-Boyer study gives equal weight to climate, housing, crime, transportation, health care, recreation, education, the arts and economics. That might tend to give an edge to larger cities, which have more amenities, and does n't take into account which factors people think are most important. Other studies tend to focus on one aspect of life, such relief from stress _ which the advocacy group Zero Population Growth found in <LOCATION> Cedar </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rapids </LOCATION> and a study in Psychology Today magazine found in State College. Or they consider the preferences of a specific group of people, as Money magazine does, polling 251 subscribers. In its 1987 survey, <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION> was 43rd; <LOCATION> Nashua </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.H. </LOCATION>, was No. 1. Last year, <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION> moved to No. 20; <LOCATION> Danbury </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, was top of the heap. A change from one year to the next in what the subscribers consider most important _ say, education over leisure, or transportation over weather _ plus even a small shift in a city's vital statistics can account for a wild fluctuation, said <PERSON> Sperling </PERSON>, whose company, <ORGANIZATION> Fast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forward </ORGANIZATION>, has created a computer program called `` Places U.S.A.'' used by Money `` Some of the cities that have been disappointingly rated have used it to say, ` Oh, yeah?,' and show they have a strong community support base,'' said <PERSON> Randy </PERSON> <PERSON> Arndt </PERSON>, spokesman for the National League of Cities. `` It depends on the resourcefulness of the city.'' The league would n't dream of ranking its 1,400 members. `` I do n't know who these surveys benefit, except the authors Everybody does n't live in the perfect place, but it's home to us,'' <PERSON> Arndt </PERSON> said. `` Whether you live in <LOCATION> Scarsdale </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Saginaw </LOCATION>, life is what you make of it.'' The same can be said of city ratings. In the next `` Places Rated,'' <PERSON> Savageau </PERSON> and <PERSON> Boyer </PERSON> plan a section designed to make everyone happy by showing how under certain conditions, using factors in the book, any burg can be a <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>. `` For instance, if the only thing you're interested in are cities in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> with a moderate climate and low cost of living,'' <PERSON> Savageau </PERSON> said, `` <LOCATION> Yuba </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> would be the best place in the whole country.''

 EDITOR'S NOTE _ Most Jews leaving the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> today are heading somewhere other than <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. That's partly because the dream has gone sour for many of the so-called `` refuseniks'' who reached the Promised Land after years of persecution only to find that in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> the issues are not always black and white. Further, Soviet Jews do n't always feel welcome in the Jewish state.

 After years of struggle to get out of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, often at the pain of prison or Siberian exile, many former `` refuseniks'' have become disillusioned at what they found when they reached their Promised Land. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, they have discovered, is beset by a chaotic political system and deep social divisions between religious and secular Jews. Even more disturbing to some is the harsh repression of the <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> uprising that has been going on for more than a year now. More than 385 Palestinians have died. <PERSON> Natan </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharansky </PERSON>, whose 12-year emigration battle made him a hero of <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jewry </LOCATION>, has found his loyalties torn between his Jewish patriotism and his concern for human rights. Two of his former colleagues in the fight inside the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> _ <LOCATION> Ida </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Nudel </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Yosef </PERSON> <PERSON> Begun </PERSON> _ have been stunned more by the cool reception that many Soviet immigrants receive in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. `` The situation of the immigrants here is so bad. After devoting 20 years of my life to this issue, it is very painful for me to face what is happening,'' said <PERSON> Nudel </PERSON>, known as the `` Guardian Angel'' for risking her own life to help other Jews in prison. These and other activists say that stories about such difficulties filtering back home are a major reason why most Jews leaving the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> today, under the glasnost policies of <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, are chosing to live someplace besides <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. In 1988, Jewish emigration from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> hit an eight-year high of 20,082. But only 7 percent came to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> _ a record `` dropout'' rate since the emigration struggle began two decades ago. In those years, about 255,000 Soviet Jews have settled in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Nudel </PERSON>, whose cause was championed by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> and stars like <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Fonda </PERSON>, typifies the loneliness and isolation experienced by many immigrants. She arrived in October 1987 after being a `` refusenik'' _ the term for those refused an exit visa _ for 16 years. She still suffers backaches from eight years in exile in <LOCATION> Siberia </LOCATION> and in <LOCATION> Bendery </LOCATION>, south of <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, as punishment for her anti-Soviet activism. <PERSON> Nudel </PERSON>, 57, is a graying and bespectacled woman who stands 4-foot-10. She is single in a family-oriented society. She recently gave away her pet dog, <PERSON> Pizer </PERSON>, brought all the way from <LOCATION> Siberia </LOCATION>, after it proved too much for her tiny, three-room apartment. Her poor understanding of Hebrew makes even watching television a chore. She spends most of her time at the apartment of her sister, <PERSON> Elana </PERSON> <PERSON> Fridman </PERSON>, occasionally venturing out to try to help fellow immigrants through the maze of <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> bureaucracy to find jobs and housing. She says she was torn between conflicting impulses _ the need to rebuild her own life and the desire to once again lead a fight for Jews from her native land. `` To be a symbol for a lifetime is too much for any human being,'' <PERSON> Nudel </PERSON> says. `` Physically, I also do n't feel very strong, but I feel I can not rest.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Fridman </PERSON>, who spearheaded the campaign for her sister's release, is frustrated that <PERSON> Nudel </PERSON> is no longer treated as a heroine `` Everyone understands that people like her made history, that these are people who suffered as Jews, but I think that there is not enough admiration shown,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Fridman </PERSON> says. `` This hurts.'' During an interview in her sister's apartment, <PERSON> Nudel </PERSON> sits uneasily on the sofa, occasionally massaging the side of her weak back. She turns the conversation away from herself to focus on the plight of immigrants in general. `` I think there is a crisis in the ideology <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> was built upon,'' she says. `` Today every newcomer is considered a nuisance. We should be considering them a blessing.'' The well-known refuseniks, who receive government stipends or can make a living writing about their experiences, do not share the poverty of most Soviet immigrants. For them, the main problem is dealing with the gap between what was a dream and what is the harsh reality of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, says <PERSON> Yuri </PERSON> <PERSON> Stern </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jewry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>. `` It takes such tremendous effort and concentration to overcome the fears in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, that to survive you need to picture <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> in an idyllic way,'' <PERSON> Stern </PERSON> says. `` Then you come here, you see that it is a real country, reality, not a dream.'' What the refuseniks and other Soviet immigrants find is that Israelis, most of whom are Middle Eastern and not European, have little concern for the plight of the new immigrants. Many native-born Israelis recall their parents' hard times in a new country 40 years ago and speak resentfully of the small government aid given to newcomers. `` Israelis say they do n't understand why the Russians shout. They say, ` When we came here back in the 1950s, we lived in tents.' But this is a different time, nobody lives in tents anymore,'' says <PERSON> Yosef </PERSON> <PERSON> Begun </PERSON>, 56, the former refusenik who waged a 17-year battle to emigrate. Begun spent about a decade in and out of jail, discarding his profession as a mathematician to help revive the study of Hebrew language and culture in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. He arrived in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> about a year ago. Unlike Nudel, Begun has found his niche in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>'s religious community and basks in his newfound freedom. `` After the snows of <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> where people wore gloomy faces because there was never enough food, here we are in a blossoming, colorful country,'' the bearded Begun says, seated by a window overlooking <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>'s old walled city.

 He works for the <ORGANIZATION> Jewish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> in a program to revive Soviet Jewish culture. <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s new liberalized policies toward minorities are allowing him to do from <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> what he could n't do 10 years ago in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. But Begun believes that <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> is not doing enough to revive Judaism in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and is critical that the issue has little public sympathy in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. `` I fear that what <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> is doing now will only amount to window dressing if we do n't take action to help more Jews learn about their past,'' he says. `` Most Soviet Jews only know they are Jewish because it is written in their passports.'' The 41-year-old <PERSON> Sharansky </PERSON> has found his new life in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to be a study in contrasts between personal bliss and disillusionment with Israeli society. <PERSON> Sharansky </PERSON>, a former member of <PERSON> Andrei </PERSON> <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Watch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, heads a new lobby group that tries to help Soviet immigrants settle in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. He is the father of two daughters, 2-year-old <PERSON> Rachel </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hannah </PERSON>, born last November. He immigrated in February 1986 after a dramatic spy swap on <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>'s Glienicke Bridge. He had spent nine years in prison on charges of anti-Soviet espionage. His sentence was reduced from 13 years after a tireless campaign by his wife, <PERSON> Avital </PERSON>, who traveleds back in his office swivel chair and says: `` It's a strange feeling _ a happy end without an end. In the movies there's a two-minute ending and it's over. This one just goes on and on. `` I still can not even get used to saying the phrases, ` The children are sleeping. The children are playing.' The very word children sounds so unusual. We keep thinking maybe it's not us. We waited so many years for this.'' <PERSON> Sharansky </PERSON> has disappointed those who thought his wit and fluent Hebrew would turn him quickly into an Israeli politician. He has turned down pleas to join the two major parties. In January, <PERSON> Sharansky </PERSON>'s name surfaced briefly as a possible candidate for <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s ambassador to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>. His supporters contended his international stature as a human rights campaigner would help improve <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s image at a time when it was being criticized for mistreating Palestinians. However, opponents appeared to win out, arguing that his appointment would sour a thaw with <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> and that he was politically too inexperienced. <PERSON> Sharansky </PERSON> has written a book about his life and, along with working for <PERSON> Soviet </PERSON> <PERSON> Jewry </PERSON>, speaks out for more tolerance between religious and secular Jews _ a problem that dogs his personal life with <PERSON> Avital </PERSON> Mrs. <PERSON> Sharansky </PERSON> is religious and he is not, making them an odd couple in a country where secular and religious Jews usually live in separate neighborhoods. <PERSON> Sharansky </PERSON> thinks religion should be a private matter, and lashes out at newspaper gossip speculating his marriage could fall apart because of religious differences. `` I feel like my own bald pate has been conscripted into <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s kulturkampf,'' or culture war, <PERSON> Sharansky </PERSON> says `` People here concentrate too much on their differences. You have to concentrate instead on principles and common aims. `` Mine and <PERSON> Avital </PERSON>'s ways about religion are very different. I am not religious but there are some things I accept that help us build a family. What I do basically is to observe the Jewish teaching of maintaining domestic tranquility.'' <PERSON> Sharansky </PERSON> is also critical of the acrimony and horse-trading among the 15 political parties in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s 120-member <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>. `` I'd like to see more mutual values and consensus in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>,'' he says. `` It also upsets me to see people sacrificing principles. The most disappointing thing is the intolerance in society. With that we will have to deal.'' <PERSON> Sharansky </PERSON> says that one of his problems in coping with what is going on in <LOCATION> Isreal </LOCATION> is getting used to having so many choices and shades of differences after fighting for so many years against the one-party system in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. `` After you fight a world which is black and white and you know exactly what you want and you do n't compromise with evil, you come to the free world where the choices are tremendous and the colors are very numerous,'' he says. One of the multicolored issues <PERSON> Sharansky </PERSON> has trouble dealing with is the Palestinian problem. His views are a vague fusion of a conservative loyalty to his new country and an overall concern for human rights. During the Palestinian uprising in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Sharansky </PERSON> has researched <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s controversial jailing practices, which allow imprisonment without trial, and complicated regulations governing when soldiers may shoot at protesters. He speaks defensively about what he has learned. `` I spoke to leading army people about instructions to soldiers, about opening fire,'' he says. `` You can not imagine how many cases there are where this is forbidden. The poor soldiers ca n't even keep track of all the rules. `` Because of the nature of this country, there are serious human rights problems, like in every country. But a democracy has instruments to deal with these problems. We have developed a system of self-checks.'' Before the uprising, <PERSON> Sharansky </PERSON> also met with Palestinian leaders in the occupied territories, such as <PERSON> Faisal </PERSON> <PERSON> Husseini </PERSON> of <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>. But he curtailed most of these contacts after sharp public accusations that he was consorting with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Sharansky </PERSON> has resisted pressures from Arab groups seeking his support by trying to draw a comparision between their struggle for a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> state and the fight for Jewish emigration from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. `` To say that because <PERSON> Sharansky </PERSON> was against the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> this should make him against the Israeli government, this is n't true,'' <PERSON> Sharansky </PERSON> says. `` There is no parallel between them. They are two principally different things.''

 EDITOR'S NOTE _ Nobel laureate <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Butler </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeats </PERSON> died in the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> in l939, but World War II delayed the return of his remains to <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> for almost a decade. Now on the 50th anniversary of his death, a great mystery hovers over his grave in <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>. Did the French undertakers dig up the wrong body or just send any old body?

 Fifty years after his death, tourists by the busload and in a procession of rental cars pay scant heed to the epitaph <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Butler </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeats </PERSON> had carved on his tombstone in the little churchyard here: `` Cast a cold eye `` On life, on death. `` Horseman, pass by!'' Last year, 50,000 visitors from as far away as <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> trooped into the <LOCATION> Church </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> graveyard `` under bare <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Bulben </PERSON>'s head,'' the flattopped mountain that like a huge grand piano with the lid down echoes the winds and waves of the wild <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION>. Some carried well-thumbed volumes by the Nobel laureate regarded by many as the sublimest poet of the English language since <PERSON> Milton </PERSON>. `` Even on the foulest, wettest day, if I leave the church open, someone is sure to come by and sign the guest book,'' says the Rev. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Hayman </PERSON>, an American from <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> by way of <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> who is rector of <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Columba </ORGANIZATION>'s, the rural Protestant parish where <PERSON> Yeats </PERSON>' great-grandfather had served Record numbers are expected for this year's semicentennial observance of the poet's death. In August, scholars and lecturers from around the world will gather for the 30th session of the <ORGANIZATION> Yeats </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Summer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>. For something to write postcards home about besides `` the most wild and beautiful scenery under a sky ever loaded and fantastic with flying clouds,'' as <PERSON> Yeats </PERSON> described it, there is renewed controversy over whether the poet actually lies beneath the epitaph he composed four months before his death in 1939. For certain, his wife is buried there, memorialized by a smaller stone engraved `` <PERSON> George </PERSON>,'' which also mystifies visitors. `` Like a plague of locusts, that question of the wrong body in the grave comes up every seven years,'' scoffed <PERSON> Aengus </PERSON> <PERSON> Cantwell </PERSON>, president-elect of the <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Yeats </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>, which administers his library and memorial in the old <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> building in <LOCATION> Sligo </LOCATION>. `` Willie probably would have enjoyed this morbid joke on himself, but it's very distasteful for his son, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON>, and daughter, <PERSON> Anne </PERSON>, to have to go through it all over again.'' <PERSON> Yeats </PERSON> in declining health sought the warmth of the <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Riviera </LOCATION>, where he died on Jan. 28, 1939. The outbreak of World War II delayed compliance with his wish to be buried at <LOCATION> Drumcliff </LOCATION>, so his casket was taken to the little cemetery at <LOCATION> Roquebrune </LOCATION> on the heights overlooking <LOCATION> Menton </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Monaco </ORGANIZATION> in the shadow of the <LOCATION> Alps </LOCATION>. Rumors of what happened there resurfaced last fall when British biographer <PERSON> Diana </PERSON> <PERSON> Souhami </PERSON> was researching the life of Dutch painter <PERSON> Hannah </PERSON> <PERSON> Gluck </PERSON>, a close friend of <PERSON> Yeats </PERSON>. She reported finding `` letters from the priest in <LOCATION> Roquebrune </LOCATION> and the undertakers'' casting doubt on who was buried where. Her version has <PERSON> Georgie </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeats </PERSON>, the poet's widow, consigning his remains to a temporary grave, which she thought would remain untouched for at least 10 years. Instead, claimed the writer, he was buried in a paupers' grave `` with four or five others,'' which was cleared in 1946 and `` all the bones placed in a common ossuary. Biographer <PERSON> Souhami </PERSON> said artist <PERSON> Gluck </PERSON> and journalist <PERSON> Edith </PERSON> <PERSON> Heald </PERSON> visited <LOCATION> Roquebrune </LOCATION> a year later and `` were shocked to find no trace of <PERSON> Yeats </PERSON>' grave.'' <PERSON> Gluck </PERSON> had friends write to the priest, who replied that it would be possible to identify the poet's remains `` if we empty the entire contents of the ossuary and if we have details of distinctive characteristics which will enable us to reconstruct the skeleton after painstaking research carried out under the direction of a medical expert.'' But, according to <PERSON> Souhami </PERSON>, `` <PERSON> Yeats </PERSON>' purported remains were exhumed and shipped to <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> just one month later _ much too soon to enable the bones to be indentified'' with scientific precision. In a letter to the <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeats </PERSON>, a member of the Irish <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> like his father, denounced her claims as `` the greatest nonsense.'' He insisted his mother had overlooked the whole operation and the remains were measured. `` It is absolutely certain that my father is buried in <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sligo </LOCATION>,'' he wrote. `` I have the documentation to prove it.'' All of which keeps alive a bizarre and macabre tale of the sort <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Butler </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeats </PERSON> would have relished hearing from the farmers and fishermen around <LOCATION> Sligo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> and retelling in glorious, ghoulish detail in his folk collection titled `` Mythologies.'' Even the reburial of <PERSON> Yeats </PERSON> at a grand state funeral is an enduring chapter in the oral history of <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>'s wild west. The American critic <PERSON> Hugh </PERSON> <PERSON> Kenner </PERSON> found this out when he interviewed the locals more than three decades after that September morning in 1948 when the Irish gunboat <PERSON> Macha </PERSON> brought the remains to <LOCATION> Galway </LOCATION> harbor `` whence they bumped to <LOCATION> Sligo </LOCATION>, past knots of schoolchildren standing mute with their teachers, along roads never built for a poet's gliding.'' He was told `` for a fact'' how `` the coffin was a substitute filled with stones, how drunken sailors let the original slide into the unplumbed <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION>; also how the <PERSON> Macha </PERSON> ran aground in <LOCATION> Sligo </LOCATION> harbor before being diverted to <LOCATION> Galway </LOCATION>, and how her load, whether stones or lead-encased bones, instantly broke the hearse's springs.'' It's almost a tale told by `` Silly Willie himself,'' as <PERSON> Cantwell </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Sligo </LOCATION> people still characterize the poet from his habit of walking solitary and often barefoot along the strand at <LOCATION> Rosses </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Point </LOCATION>, through the woods of <LOCATION> Lissadell </LOCATION>, on the lake isle of <LOCATION> Innisfree </LOCATION>, up tortuous trails to the barren heights of <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Bulben </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Knocknarea </LOCATION> and the other childhood haunts that echo in his lovely lines. <PERSON> Yeats </PERSON> was born in <LOCATION> Dublin </LOCATION>, lived much of his life in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> and died in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>. Yet he always regarded <LOCATION> Sligo </LOCATION>, where he spent every boyhoood summer, as his home. His barrister father gave up law to become a painter. His brother, <PERSON> Jack </PERSON>, was <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>'s leading artist. His mother's side of the family, the seafaring <ORGANIZATION> Middletons </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Pollexfens </PERSON>, were steamboat captains, smugglers and eventually prosperous ship owner's on whom a poor poet could always depend for a free passage home from <ORGANIZATION> Liverpool </ORGANIZATION>.

 Young <PERSON> Willie </PERSON> spent many summers with Uncle <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Middleton </PERSON> at <ORGANIZATION> Elsinore </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, which had a secret tunnel for the delivery of contraband from the beach and the ghost of that smuggling ancestor strolling the veranda or tapping at the window pane. Nearby lived bachelor uncle <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Pollexfen </PERSON>, a spirit-raising medium who imbued <PERSON> Yeats </PERSON> with a lifelong infatuation with horoscopes, seances, crystal balls, tarot cards, telepathy and remembering bizarre dreams like the apparition of `` <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Shaw </PERSON> as a smiling sewing machine.'' Young <PERSON> Yeats </PERSON> sat with old people by their turf fires to hear myths and legends he later retold in `` The Celtic Twilight'': tales about <PERSON> Queen </PERSON> <PERSON> Maeve </PERSON> buried in the massive cairn near the top of <LOCATION> Knocknarea </LOCATION>, the warrior Cuchulain who fought the horses of the sea in <LOCATION> Sligo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>, and the <PERSON> O'Cuirnin </PERSON> family of Gaelic bards with whom he felt a mythic kinship when rowing out to their island in <PERSON> Lough </PERSON> <PERSON> Gill </PERSON>. <PERSON> Yeats </PERSON> set for himself the poetic goal of bringing together <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>'s heroic legends and rural folklore after listening to tales told by the likes of `` one <PERSON> Paddy </PERSON> <PERSON> Flynn </PERSON>, a little bright-eyed old man who lived in a leaky one-room cabin'' on the <LOCATION> Sligo </LOCATION> road and often was found `` under a hedge smiling in his sleep'' after dancing the night away with troops of leprechauns. The ghost-mad lad known hereabouts as `` old parson Yeats great-grandson'' went off to <LOCATION> Stockholm </LOCATION> in 1923 to receive the Nobel Prize for literature from the King of <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>. Going down the eight fairway at <LOCATION> Rosses </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Point </LOCATION>, the cultured golfer can see the gray stone walls of <LOCATION> Lissadell </LOCATION>, the Georgian country house of Sir <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore-ooth </PERSON>, also haunted and now open to tourists. Here <PERSON> Yeats </PERSON> wrote a tragic poem to the two daughters that begins: `` The lights of evening, <PERSON> Lissadell </PERSON>, `` Great windows open to the south, `` Two girls in silk kimonos, both `` Beautiful, one a gazelle.'' <PERSON> Constance </PERSON>, the older of two, not the gazelle, whose name was Eve, was an impassioned Irish revolutionary who was sentenced to a firing squad for commanding the forces that held St. <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON>'s <PERSON> Green </PERSON> during the Easter Rising of 1916. Her sentence was commuted to life in prison, and <PERSON> Yeats </PERSON> wrote several poems to her before her eventual release. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> hurriedly executed 16 leaders of the rising, including the severly wounded <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Connolly </PERSON>, who was carried in a wheel chair out to the firing squad, and <PERSON> Yeats </PERSON> helped canonize them as martyrs in a magnificent canto. Farther south along the coast in neighboring <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Galway </LOCATION> is <LOCATION> Coole </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>, where for two decades <PERSON> Yeats </PERSON> was the frequent house guest of the playwright <PERSON> Lady </PERSON> <PERSON> Augusta </PERSON> <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON>. The great house in <LOCATION> Dublin </LOCATION> where they launched the Irish National Theater, which soon became the Abbey Theater, has been torn down, but in the walled garden amid the ruins is a huge copper bench carved with the initials of <PERSON> Yeats </PERSON>, <PERSON> Shaw </PERSON>, <PERSON> Sean </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Casey </PERSON>, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Masefield </PERSON>, the painter <PERSON> Augustus </PERSON> <PERSON> John </PERSON> and the abbey's resident genius, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Millington </PERSON> <PERSON> Synge </PERSON>. A few miles away is <PERSON> Thoor </PERSON> <PERSON> Ballylee </PERSON>, the 14th century <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> tower that <PERSON> Yeats </PERSON> renovated as a summer cottage for <PERSON> Georgie </PERSON> <PERSON> Hyde-Lees </PERSON>, the 22-year-old bride he took after years of pining away in impassioned poetry for actress <PERSON> Maud </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonne </PERSON>. <PERSON> George </PERSON>, as she was called in life as well as on her tiny tombstone, was also a psychic medium who introduced <PERSON> Yeats </PERSON> to `` automatic writing.'' The tower, which figured in the title of two collections of <PERSON> Yeats </PERSON>' verse, is now a Yeats museum. Tourists can climb the winding stairs to the secret room on the top floor where the couple sought contact with the beyond. <PERSON> George </PERSON> continues to intrigue the pilgrims who ignore <PERSON> Yeats </PERSON>' injunction to pass by the grave `` It's the name of his dog,'' pastor <PERSON> Hayman </PERSON> has heard many a visitor comment. `` Actually,'' said <PERSON> Cantwell </PERSON>, `` <PERSON> Yeats </PERSON> had a dog named <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connell </PERSON>.'' The poet was never comfortable with the laboring class that worshiped The Liberator but a generation later deserted <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Parnell </PERSON>. Although a shrewd businessman himself, who cast a warm eye on the abbey's box office, <PERSON> Yeats </PERSON> also professed haughty disdain for the merchants who `` fumble in a greasy till.'' The poet, said <PERSON> Cantwell </PERSON>, `` regarded the peasants as the font of Irish poetic lore and greatly admired the occupants of the stately houses, but he did n't care much for those in between.'' A sense of `` romance and adventure'' propelled the Rev. <PERSON> Hayman </PERSON> from <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> Luke </PERSON>'s in downtown <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columba </LOCATION>'s in rural <LOCATION> Sligo </LOCATION>. Several summers before, while based in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>, he had swapped pulpits with a <LOCATION> Limerick </LOCATION> clergyman and `` fell in love with <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>. When <PERSON> Drumcliff </PERSON> became available last March, my wife <PERSON> Sally </PERSON> and I were ready.'' Going though the parish archives he discovered that the Rev. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeats </PERSON>, the poet's ancestor, `` had run up a bill of some 400 pounds with the wine merchant in <LOCATION> Sligo </LOCATION>, which was a goodly amount in 1846.'' So far pastor <PERSON> Hayman </PERSON> has had neither the occasion nor the collection receipts to match that standard of hospitality. His noon service on Sunday draws a congregation of 55, `` mostly farming people.'' But with the advent of summer and the return of the chartered buses, the parish operates a little tea shop in a shed near the rectory and provides toilet facilities. `` It's really amazing,'' <PERSON> Hayman </PERSON> says. They come from all over. <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Holland </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. Many from <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. If you noticed, we just had new doors put on the church. Those lovely brass handles were the gift of the <ORGANIZATION> Yeats </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Western </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Australia </ORGANIZATION>.'' The pilgrims arrive full of awe and sometimes wonder. `` This past summer,'' <PERSON> Hayman </PERSON> recalls, `` a busload arrived led by a Roman Catholic priest who was totally dumbfounded to find that <PERSON> Yeats </PERSON> was buried in a Protestant churchyard.'' The American pastor at Drumcliff is called upon time and again to explain that enigmatic epitaph. `` I always have to admit I do n't know what it means Some scholars say the poet may be addressing his own ghost. All I know is you could write a Ph.D. thesis on those few words.''

 There are men who dress like women and women who dress like <PERSON> Madonna </PERSON>, college students whose nocturnal revelry precludes classes before 2 p.m. Theirs is a kinky world of acid-house music, designer drugs and sexual antics in the safe-sex era. <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> dance clubs are a way of life for `` club kids'' in their late teens and early 20s, many of them from suburbs and small towns where an affinity for late hours and bizarre clothes made them outcasts. `` It's about coming from somewhere where you're really not accepted,'' says <PERSON> Katarina </PERSON> <PERSON> Markovic </PERSON>, 22, a would-be fashion designer and club regular from <LOCATION> Louisville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>. `` We are here because we do n't fit in somewhere else.'' `` I started out as an <ORGANIZATION> Ivy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> student at <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>, started going to clubs and found it was more fun,'' says <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Bankoff </PERSON>, 20, an emigre from a <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> suburb who has since transferred to a less-demanding college. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Alig </PERSON>, 21, came to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bend </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ind. </LOCATION>, to attend <ORGANIZATION> Fordham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. But after his introduction to the clubs, he too transferred to an easier school. Today he works as a party promoter, earning $ 1,000 from club owners for each bash he throws. He chooses his guests from 12 mailing lists of 1,500 names each, devises a theme ranging from Hawaiian luaus to television commercials, hires the entertainment, orders the food and plays host. The most outrageous parties are mentioned in the half-dozen periodicals devoted to the club scene or in the gossip columns of the daily tabloids. Good press and fabulous parties provide clubs with the reputations they need to attract people who pay $ 15 a head to get in. In contrast, club kids usually get in for free. The trick is to dress outrageously and know the doorman _ another source of club employment, one that pays up to $ 100 for a three-hour shift. At 1 a.m. on one winter Tuesday, yuppies, businessmen, and sedately dressed college students wait in line outside <LOCATION> M.K. </LOCATION>, a <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> club, as the woman working the door whisks <PERSON> Alig </PERSON> and two pals inside. <PERSON> Alig </PERSON> wears makeup, shorts made of fake fur, and suspenders. His roommate wears a cowboy costume. With them is a 19-year-old girl in a decollete black dress. `` Those people are expedited into the clubs,'' explains <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Roccio </PERSON>, who owns <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION>, an East Village club. `` They are the happening people, but aside from that, they entertain as well. We want to look at those kids. We want to watch them cavort. Part of the entertainment of the evening is to go home and say, ` Did you see that guy with the blond wig and spangled eye shadow?''' Bizarre decor and odd locales help set the clubs' anything-can-happen mood M.K. features a wall lined with bones, and because it is housed in a former bank, giant vault doors open out onto the dance floor. The hot new club Mars, which opened in January, is housed in a warehouse in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>'s meat-packing district at 10th Avenue and 13th Street _ described by the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Yorker </ORGANIZATION> magazine as `` a location that would kill your mother if she knew where you were.'' Renovating the five-story building cost $ 1 million and the decorations include a wall of computer chipboards, a rusted piano, old television sets, and a collection of tribal masks. At <LOCATION> M.K. </LOCATION>, entertainment ranges from a `` performance artist'' whose act consists of yodeling and shrieking, to a man sheathed in yards of white tulle lying languorously on a sofa beneath a giant canvas splattered with black and white paint. He wears a woman's wig, makeup, high heels _ and nothing else.

 On the dance floor, illuminated solely by three red track lights, the crowd boogies to acid-house music, a repetitive, fast-paced form of disco with little melody, lots of computer tones, and a generous helping of old dance tracks, remixed and played at mind-numbing volume. One popular cut, by the British band <LOCATION> Bam </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bam </LOCATION>, is called `` Where's Your Child? The musical question is answered with a deep, sinister echoing laugh and a single word: `` Ecstasy.'' The reference is to a mood-altering, amphetamine-based pill. <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> agents say they ca n't find ecstasy _ formally known as MDMA _ on the streets. In the clubs, regulars buy it for $ 20 a hit. A 23-year-old art gallery worker describes a typical evening: `` I go to the clubs, do ex, and go to work tripping the next day.'' While some say ecstasy is the club kids' drug of choice, others say it is merely a fad. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Musto </PERSON>, who covers the club scene for the <ORGANIZATION> Village </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Voice </ORGANIZATION>, says those who take ecstasy are `` a minuscule portion of the population.'' Club owner <PERSON> Roccio </PERSON> agrees that alcohol is the substance most often abused by the club crowd. The drinking age in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> is 21, but clubs can admit 16 - to 20-year-olds if they do n't serve them liquor _ a law that is often winked at But what's more striking in the clubs than either drug or alcohol abuse is the highly charged sexual atmosphere. Women wear leather bras as outerwear and skirts that are 10 inches long from waistline to hem. Male go-go dancers wear Jockey shorts and sneakers. <PERSON> Musto </PERSON> says the antics sometimes get out of hand. In one case, he says, a participant in a wet T-shirt contest was nearly gang-raped by clamoring spectators before she was rescued by her boyfriend. <PERSON> Roccio </PERSON> also sees `` a new wildness'' on the club scene. `` I think there is a revived sexual awakening ... We're going through the terrible, terrible reality of the AIDS crisis, and like anything else, we're seeing a backlash on the part of the younger people,'' he says. Fear of AIDS dissuades most people from the one-night stands that were common on the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> disco scene in the late 1970s and early'80s. Instead, says <PERSON> Musto </PERSON>, scanty clothing and X-rated entertainment constitute `` a sexual three-ring circus. You ca n't have sex, so you can at least watch a bizarre variation.'' The club kids are blase. Despite `` the nudity and outrageous dress, people are going home alone,'' says <PERSON> Andy </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, 23, a native of <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>. As for the sex antics inside the clubs, a 19-year-old known on the club circuit as <PERSON> Julie </PERSON> <PERSON> Jewels </PERSON> says: `` It was all in fun _ it was n't dangerous.'' Like many club kids, Jewels has adopted a pseudonym and cultivates an image to match. She wears a long, blonde hairpiece and low-cut, tight dresses, slit up the side, often sequined or black, that she designs herself. She came from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> 10 years ago and says her father does n't mind her club-hopping, as long as she finishes her education at <ORGANIZATION> Hunter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>. Jewels' 15 minutes of celebrity have arrived. She was recently photographed by <ORGANIZATION> Mademoiselle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> magazine </ORGANIZATION> for an article on clubs, and she even has imitators known as `` Julie Jewels Wannabes.'' Other club kids speak proudly of phone calls from radio programs, <ORGANIZATION> MTV </ORGANIZATION> and mainstream magazines for stories on ecstasy and acid-house music. But it's fame on the club circuit that really counts. If the person working the door recognizes you, you've made it. <PERSON> Roccio </PERSON>, the 40-year-old father of an 18-year-old girl, says the quest for fame began with the club kids' baby-boomer parents. `` We grew up in a world where everyone was going to be exceptional, where everyone was going to be someone,'' he explains. `` The Beatles were just four guys from <ORGANIZATION> Liverpool </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Elvis </PERSON> was just some guy from <LOCATION> Tupelo </LOCATION>.'' He adds: `` We made our kids feel they had every right to be stars.''

 Convicted child killer <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Diane </PERSON> <PERSON> Downs </PERSON>, who describes herself as the most hated woman in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, giggles nervously as she talks of her plans to marry a former police officer from <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>. The 33-year-old former mail carrier, one of <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>'s most notorious criminals of modern times, also smiles a lot when she talks about a new book about her trial which is due out this spring. Ms. <PERSON> Downs </PERSON> was sentenced to life in prison plus 50 years for killing her 7-year-old daughter and wounding her two other children on a rural road outside <LOCATION> Springfield </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ore. </LOCATION>, on May 19, 1983. An appeal of the conviction was set aside without comment on Jan. 4. She was transferred to the Correctional Institution for Women in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> after she escaped in July 1987 by scaling a fence at the Oregon Women's Correctional Center in <LOCATION> Salem </LOCATION>. She remained at large for 10 days until she was found with a group of men less than a mile from the prison. Prison authorities believe she has less chance of escaping in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> because she does n't know anybody here and she would have no place to run. Prison guards at <PERSON> Clinton </PERSON> say Ms. <PERSON> Downs </PERSON> keeps to herself, but associates say she thrives on publicity. As one guard put it, `` The last thing her ego needs is another interview.'' `` She sees a camera and her whole world brightens,'' says <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Rule </PERSON>, a Seattle-based author whose book, `` Small Sacrifices'' about the Downs case rode the best-seller list of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> for 25 weeks this year. `` I do n't believe she has any emotion for her children beyond the fact that they're her possession and somebody took them away from her.'' Prosecutors charged that the children were shot because Ms. <PERSON> Downs </PERSON> believed they interfered in her relationship with a boyfriend who did not want to be a father. Ms. <PERSON> Downs </PERSON> contends that a stranger flagged down her car shot her and the children. She was wounded by a single bullet in the left arm. `` What happened the night of the shooting was so horrendous, so unexpected, so unbelievable,'' Ms. <PERSON> Downs </PERSON> said in a recent jailhouse interview. `` I'm very self-disciplined and I need to have control of my own existence. I just reached a point of not knowing what was real and what was n't.'' <PERSON> Cheryl </PERSON> <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON> <PERSON> Downs </PERSON>, 7, was killed. Fourteen year-old <PERSON> Christie </PERSON> <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> was left handicapped in her speech, 9-year-old <PERSON> Danny </PERSON> is paralyzed from the waist down. The lead prosecutor in the case, <LOCATION> Lane </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Assistant District Attorney <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Hugi </PERSON>, adopted the children. Ms. <PERSON> Downs </PERSON> says she spends her time exchanging letters with her new fiance, whom she described as a former police officer who saw her on `` The <PERSON> Oprah </PERSON> <PERSON> Winfrey </PERSON> show'' and wrote her because he felt sorry for her. `` Anybody who would want to be involved with the most hated woman in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> must be a nut,'' Ms. <PERSON> Downs </PERSON> says. `` But he's not a wacko. He's genuine.'' She declines to indentify the man except that he's a former <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> police officer who has since moved to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>. `` I'm lucid. I've been married before and I said I never would do it again. But I'm in love,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Downs </PERSON>, who was married for eight years to <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Downs </PERSON>, an electrician and farm laborer. <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON>, a state <ORGANIZATION> Corrections </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman, confirmed that Ms. <PERSON> Downs </PERSON> has asked the department for permission to marry the man. Ms. <PERSON> White </PERSON> also would not identify him. She said the couple are in the preliminary stages of applying for permission to marry. They still must meet with the prison chaplain and obtain the approval of the superintendent who submits the request to a committee for a recommendation. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> does not permit conjugal visits, she added. Ms. <PERSON> Downs </PERSON>, who earned an associate's degree in general studies while imprisoned in <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>, has also completed a book, `` Best-Kept Secrets,'' scheduled for release in April by <ORGANIZATION> Danmark </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Publishing </ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION> Springfield </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ore. </LOCATION>. About 75 percent of the 350-page book will be direct quotes from the trial transcript, Ms. <PERSON> Downs </PERSON> said A spokesman for <PERSON> Danmark </PERSON> says that any profits from the book will go to the state of <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> under a law passed in the wake of the Downs case. Its release surely will spark more discussion of the case, but Ms. <PERSON> Downs </PERSON> says she does n't believe her children will suffer if people talk about her case. `` How could the truth hurt the kids?'' Ms. <PERSON> Downs </PERSON> says. `` I get so frustrated when I hear things like that ... How can the truth hurt anybody unless they're a liar?'' But Ms. <PERSON> Rule </PERSON> says the truth that she observed in the nine-month trial was a guilty Ms. <PERSON> Downs </PERSON>, who was pregnant at the time with another child, who was later put up for adoption. `` I've never seen anyone as manipulative as <PERSON> Diane </PERSON>,'' Ms. <PERSON> Rule </PERSON> says, describing her as `` sociopathic, histrionic and narcissistic.'' `` I think she knows what she did,'' Ms. <PERSON> Rule </PERSON> says. `` The truth is buried so deep that she does n't have to think about it. She's not crazy though.'' But Ms. <PERSON> Downs </PERSON> denies her guilt and says the bonds between her and her children remain. `` They're part of my body that broke away,'' she says. `` They love me but at the same time they're uncomfortable with ever being with me again.''

 It's enough to make a Cajun drool. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON> has millions of pounds of redfish. He has baby redfish and 40-year-old monsters, and all sizes in between. Down a sandy road, a couple of miles from the beach, <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON> has redfish growing so fast in 31 acres of ponds and tanks that he thinks they'll take less than two years to go from tiny fingerlings to three pounds or better _ ready for cooking. Hunt is one of several entrepreneurs who hope to save the Cajun delicacy _ even the redfish itself _ from extinction. It all started when <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> Chef <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Prudhomme </PERSON> flipped a redfish into a white-hot iron skillet and charred it in deep spices, setting off a national craze for blackened redfish. `` Mr. <PERSON> Prudhomme </PERSON> did a very good job,'' says <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON> of <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON>'s Restaurant in the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>' French Quarter. `` Blackened redfish has become part of the restaurant folklore in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>, along with oysters <PERSON> Rockefeller </PERSON> and bananas Foster. People from all over the country want it. `` It's not just in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> that people demanded it. It would be hard to go into any major city in the country and not find blackened redfish on a menu somewhere.'' <PERSON> Prudhomme </PERSON> says he does n't understand; blackened tuna would be just as good. Indeed, when the demand for redfish grew great enough to threaten the very existence of the species, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> restaurants changed the menu to feature other blackened fish, especially other members of the drum family. Last year, the state of <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>, alarmed by the depletion of redfish in the <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, stopped all commercial fishing through 1991 and banned the sale of redfish caught off <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> until 1992. Conservation officials said the redfish catch, estimated at 54,000 pounds in 1980, jumped to 5.4 million pounds in 1986 as the Cajun craze spread. Facing predictions that the catch could hit 20 millions pounds annually, concerned federal conservationists stepped in and state officials followed suit, virtually stopping fishing for red drum in the Gulf. After the shutdown, demand for the fish grew so that an underground market developed, leading to arrests at the kitchen doors of some of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>' classiest restaurants. With that kind of market, men like <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON> thought it would be worth the effort to find a way to farm redfish _ unique problems notwithstanding. After all, catfish farming has become commonplace in <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Misssissippi </LOCATION> ponds. But redfish are saltwater creatures that thrive in wide-ranging environments, running from spawning grounds in the <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> marshes to far out in the <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>. How do you pen up game fish and coax them to live and breed in captivity? Hunt had one idea. He set up set stainless steel tanks at Pass Christian, not far from the <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> state line. Other farmers are trying submerged cages and blocked-off canals in the <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> marsh. At his <ORGANIZATION> Redfish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hatchery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON> has created a perpetual spring for about a dozen fish. They mate regularly in the dim waters of three spawning tanks. When the fingerlings reach a certain size they are transferred to ponds, which have pure oxygen pumped into them. <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON> says the technique he worked out can produce marketable redfish rapidly. `` By loading the water with oxygen we can practically watch the redfish grow,'' he says. He predicts the ponds will produce over a million pounds of redfish a year, averaging three to five pounds each. <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON> says the one-acre ponds cost about $ 25,000 to build, not including the costs of a well to supply the water. But there is a potential for profit. When sales stopped, redfish fillets were selling at $ 5.35 a pound in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> seafood markets. Although redfish will survive in full-strength sea water or barely salty water, some salinity is needed, and the closer the fish farm is to sea water, the fewer problems growers experience. In <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parish </ORGANIZATION>, the salt comes from a pool atop a salt dome. Sugar cane farmer <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Landry </PERSON> turned 25 acres into a redfish pond by drilling a well at the dome and mixing that with fresh water to produce the equivalent of sea water. <PERSON> Landry </PERSON> hopes to market redfish from the pond every 22 months, with his first crop due in midsummer. Another group of investors is raising redfish in abandoned oil canals in the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> marsh. They are betting that the fish will thrive in natural conditions. Efforts to grow a marketable product include blocking off the ends of dead-end canals and filling them with fingerlings, and raising the small fish in cages. `` We have about 55,000 fish in the water in eight cages,'' says <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Mariculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enterprises </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> says his group has invested $ 250,000 and a lot of sweat in the venture, but expects to see a profit in the long run `` We should have fish ready to see by the fall,'' he says. `` It'll be three years until we see any profit, but long-range, we expect it to pay off.''

 Feminists are readying a second try at ratification of the Equal Rights Amendment, but this time they'll have to do it without the help of former congresswoman <PERSON> Martha </PERSON> <PERSON> Griffiths </PERSON> It was <PERSON> Griffiths </PERSON>, now <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>'s 77-year-old lieutenant governor, who stalked the halls of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to get the 218 signatures needed to pull the ERA out of a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> committee and onto the floor for debate, clearing the way for its eventual overwhelming approval by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in 1972. But the amendment was ratified by only 35 state legislatures, three short of the number needed to add it to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Constitution. `` I think part of the problem is that it's also associated with rights for minorities and you'd be surprised how much racism there still is in this world,'' says <PERSON> Griffiths </PERSON>, a Democrat. `` Another thing, some men resent tremendously the idea of a woman coming into their offices and really having a chance at promotion.'' <PERSON> Griffiths </PERSON> predicts the amendment will be ratified this century as young women become more aware of discrimination. The next time around, she says, the case for the amendment should be presented in economic terms. `` I never had anybody objecting to my trying to get more money for their working wives.'' She says women themselves are partially to blame for not being more aggressive in seeking promotions and asking for equal treatment. `` I think a lot of women just wo n't do it,'' she says. <PERSON> Griffiths </PERSON>, now in her second four-year term as lieutenant governor, never displayed such reluctance when it came to fighting for women. Born <PERSON> Martha </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Pierce </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo. </LOCATION>, on Jan. 29, 1912, <PERSON> Griffiths </PERSON> is descended from a family that homesteaded in the area. `` My father thought that girls were as smart as boys and he encouraged me,'' said <PERSON> Griffiths </PERSON>, who grew up going squirrel hunting alongside the boys, out-shooting them because of her steady hands. She attended the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Missouri </ORGANIZATION>, where she met her future husband, <PERSON> Hicks </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Griffiths </PERSON>. They attended the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Michigan </ORGANIZATION> law school together, graduating in 1940 as the institution's first married couple. After working together for a <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> insurance company, the two established their own law firm in 1946. They worked on the successful gubernatorial campaign of <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mennen </PERSON> `` Soapy'' <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> in 1948. <PERSON> Griffiths </PERSON> was elected to the state <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> and in 1952 ran for <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. She lost, but won the seat two years later and became the first woman to serve on the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Means </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. `` There is where you find how badly women have been treated,'' she says of the tax-writing panel. One of <PERSON> Griffith </PERSON>'s early targets was Social Security, which she said required women to pay in as much as men but paid women and their children less benefits when they retired or died. `` What kind of nonsense was that?'' she asks rhetorically. <PERSON> Griffiths </PERSON> wrestled with the complexities of Social Security and inheritance tax laws, but her greatest achievement involved adding the word `` sex'' to the 1964 Civil Rights Act. The effect was to outlaw discrimination against women, blacks and members of other racial minorities and create the basis for countless lawsuits. Her amendment caught potential opponents flat-footed and it passed before members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> knew what they had done. `` It was a glorious accident,'' she says. `` It really changed <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>.'' Feminist leaders revere her. `` She's a legend in her own time,'' says <PERSON> Marian </PERSON> <PERSON> McCracken </PERSON>, former president of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Women </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>'s representative on NOW's national board `` She understood sex discrimination way before her time, way before other people did and tried to use her position to do something about it,'' says <PERSON> Eleanor </PERSON> <PERSON> Smeal </PERSON>, president of the Fund for a <ORGANIZATION> Feminist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Majority </ORGANIZATION>, whose goal is to elect more women to public office. <PERSON> Griffiths </PERSON> says the push for the ERA changed women's lives even though the amendment did not pass. `` Scores, if not hundreds, of acts were passed at the state, local and federal level, eliminating the worst of the discriminations,'' she says, adding that ERA opponents thought such concessions could blunt the drive for the amendment's passage. <PERSON> Griffiths </PERSON> surprised the state in 1974 by deciding against returning to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> after her 10th term. She said she had tired of commuting after two decades. She was serving on a number of corporate boards, earning $ 360,000 a year, when then-U.S. Rep. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Blanchard </PERSON> picked her to be his running mate in 1982. Critics say <PERSON> Griffiths </PERSON> is getting too old to preside over the state <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, where she has been known to hush noisy senators during debate. `` <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, who just left the presidency, is a year older than I, so what are they really talking about? What they're really talking about is a woman. They object to a woman doing anything,'' she says. `` That's really it. But when you put it to a vote, the people accept me.'' Despite her crusty comments, <PERSON> Griffith </PERSON> has the air of a grandmother with her white hair, wrinkled face, and slow walk. She has grandmotherly feelings, too, carrying pictures of her secretaries' children in her purse and lining her office halls with paintings of children. <PERSON> Griffiths </PERSON> had no children. `` I suppose you do n't regret what you've never had, but I have enjoyed other people's children,'' she says. Despite her age, <PERSON> Griffiths </PERSON> keeps a heavy schedule. Once when <PERSON> Blanchard </PERSON>'s office asked for a list of her engagements since taking office, <PERSON> Griffiths </PERSON>' staff needed three days to compile an 80-page list containing 900 speeches. <PERSON> Griffiths </PERSON> has n't decided whether to remain on the ticket if <PERSON> Blanchard </PERSON> runs again for governor in 1990.

 <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> <PERSON> Stockwell </PERSON> says his role as an outrageous and flamboyant gangster in `` Married To the Mob'' opened a new career for him in comedy. It led to his first television series, <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Quantum Leap,'' a comic adventure about time travel in which he appears only as a hologram. `` Marriedso brought <PERSON> Stockwell </PERSON> his first nomination for an Academy Award as best supporting actor. `` It's something I've dreamed about for years,'' To the Mob'' alhe says. `` The reality is ... I ca n't describe it. It's just one of the best feelings I've ever had.'' Just before he committed himself to `` Quantum Leap,'' <PERSON> Stockwell </PERSON> says, he was working with <ORGANIZATION> Orion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pictures </ORGANIZATION> on a series pilot based on his character of <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> the Tiger in `` Married To the Mob.'' `` But they took too long to put it together,'' he says. `` Then <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Bellisario </PERSON> called and offered me this. It's the first time anyone's offered me a series and the first time I've ever wanted to do one. If people had n't seen me in `` Married To the Mob' they would n't have realized I could do comedy.'' <PERSON> Stockwell </PERSON> and <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakula </PERSON> star in `` Quantum Leap'' as physicists who are working on a time travel experiment. <PERSON> Bakula </PERSON> isrch. In `` Married To the Mob,'' <PERSON> Stockwell </PERSON> was <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> `` The Tiger'' <PERSON> Russo </PERSON>, a character who's right up there with Scarface, <PERSON> Little </PERSON> <PERSON> Caesar </PERSON> and the rest, but is still charming and personable and in a perverted way is like a yuppie hood. <PERSON> Stockwell </PERSON> says he is into his `` third career.'' His father was <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Stockwell </PERSON>, a Broadway performer who replaced <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Drake </PERSON> in `` <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION>.'' He was the voice of <ORGANIZATION> Prince </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Charming </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> in </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Walt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.'' As a child, <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> <PERSON> Stockwell </PERSON> appeared on Broadway in `` Innocent Voyage.'' The studio scouts saw him and he was in such movies as `` Anchors Aweigh,'' `` The Boy with <PERSON> Green </PERSON> <PERSON> Hair </PERSON>,'' `` Gentlemen's Agreement'' and `` Kim.'' `` I was very lucky to have a loving and caring and sympathetic mother and not a stage mother,'' he says. `` She was very helpful to me as a child. It was n't always easy. `` I dropped out of acting a few times. I quit when I was 16 and did n't come back until I was 21. When I came back I did ` Compulsion,' ` Long Day's Journey Into the Night,' ` Sons and Lovers' and ` Rapture.' <PERSON> Stockwell </PERSON> dropped out again in the 1960s to become a hippie. `` I never really wanted to be an actor,'' he says. `` I found acting very difficult from the beginning. I worked long hours, six days a week. It was n't fun. I came back each time because I had no other training.'' The second time he returned, <PERSON> Stockwell </PERSON> found it very difficult to get re-established. It was n't until he did `` <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>'' that he felt he had made it. `` Out of sight, out of mind,'' he says. `` Luck has a lot to do with it.'' Since then, he's done `` To Live and Die in <LOCATION> L.A. </LOCATION>,'' `` Dune,'' `` <LOCATION> Beverly </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION> Cop II,'' `` Gardens of Stone,'' `` Blue Velvet'' and the TV movie `` Gambler III.'' In `` <PERSON> Tucker </PERSON>,'' he played <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON>. He co-stars with <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Hopper </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jodie </PERSON> <PERSON> Foster </PERSON> in `` Backtrack'' and with <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Cattrell </PERSON> in `` Palais Royale.'' <PERSON> Stockwell </PERSON> makes his permanent home in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> with his wife, <PERSON> Joy </PERSON>, and their two children, <PERSON> Austin </PERSON> and <PERSON> Sophia </PERSON>. <PERSON> Stockwell </PERSON> hopes his brother, <PERSON> Guy </PERSON>, can appear with him in an episode of `` Quantum Leap.'' Their last time acting together was in `` Innocent Voyage'' on Broadway 40 years ago. Guy had been in a number of movies and was in such series as `` Adventures in Paradise'' and `` The <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Boone </PERSON> Show.'' In recent years he has devoted most of his time to teaching.

 In the basement of the student union building at <ORGANIZATION> Duke </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, a nervous <PERSON> Ellen </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> fidgeted in the last row of a small, dark studio theater. She sat as far away as possible from her father, playwright <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, and her former stepmother, actress <PERSON> Marsha </PERSON> <PERSON> Mason </PERSON>. They were at <LOCATION> Duke </LOCATION>, along with her younger sister, <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON>, to attend the world premiere of `` Moon and <PERSON> Valentino </PERSON>,'' the first play by the 31-year-old Miss <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> to make it to the stage. Throughout the evening, <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Mason </PERSON> leaned forward, hanging on to each word of dialogue. <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> kept taking off his glasses and wiping his eyes. When the play was over and the hearty applause diminished, the four embraced in the tiny theater's cramped aisle. `` It was a special joy, that first experience, listening to the play on stage,'' <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> said the next day. `` Now we can be more objective about it.'' `` Moonlight and Valentino'' is personal, even painful, but like her famous father's plays, it also is filled with laughter. And like <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>'s `` Chapter Two'' and his `` <LOCATION> Brighton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>'' trilogy, it echoes the playwright's own life. The play concerns a young woman whose husband is killed in an automobile accident and how she copes with his death. Miss <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>'s husband, <PERSON> Jeffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Bishop </PERSON>, an astrophysicist, died in November 1987 when he was struck by a car while out jogging For Miss <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, `` Moonlight and Valentino'' goes beyond her own experience. `` I feel that the personal aspect is limited to the fact that I know what it's like to go through intense grief, to go through a jarring, sudden loss and to be left, all of a sudden, with an enormous mountain to climb and not knowing whether you are going to make it,'' she said. `` The fact is that I did find myself at the bottom of the mountain, did climb it somehow, bolstered by friends, family and my son, <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON>. I got up there and was changed, by not running away from the grief but by experiencing it. That's what made me want to write it.'' Miss <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, who had her own dance troupe and worked as a choreographer, has always been a writer, turning out short stories and even starting a novel at age 15. That was the year her mother, <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>'s first wife, <PERSON> Joan </PERSON>, died of cancer. She wrote another play and a screenplay before attempting `` Moonlight and Valentino.'' Neither was any good, she says. But her father and <PERSON> Emanuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Azenberg </PERSON>, who produces <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>'s plays on Broadway, encouraged her to continue. `` Bigger,'' counseled <PERSON> Azenberg </PERSON>. `` Write something bigger.'' <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> was more cautious about his daughter's writing career. `` I think my father was frightened the first time I showed him a script,'' Miss <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> said. `` What if it was n't good? What was he going to say to me? But he read it and, I think, was relieved. Then he gave me a lot of criticism.'' Both the screenplay and that first play remain in her bottom drawer, unproduced. Not so with `` Moonlight and Valentino.'' The play was given a reading last July in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Azenberg </PERSON> brought it to <PERSON> Duke </PERSON>, where he teaches a course in the school's drama program, for a two-week workshop production in February. Further development is possible, probably at Stages Repertory Theater in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> later this year. When it will come to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, no one is sure. `` Once I knew why I wanted to write it, which was to talk about transformation and if pain comes to you, do n't avoid it, almost embrace it because there is an opportunity there,'' Miss <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> says. `` Once I established what I wanted to say, the characters came not so much from my life but from the need to create conflict within the play.'' Miss <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>'s heroine, <PERSON> Rebecca </PERSON>, is comforted in her grief by a chain-smoking sister, a dizzy best girlfriend whose marriage is falling apart, and an acerbic ex-stepmother who still cares for her former husband's children. `` I knew ` Moonlight and Valentino' could n't be one woman's journey,'' Miss <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> says `` I knew it had to be four women's journeys, bring them to a point of realization in their own lives There's a line in the play about the house attracting ` widows of all sorts.' That's what I wanted to write about.'' The play also has one male character _ a handsome house painter nicknamed ` <PERSON> Valentino </PERSON>' by the women. Although he has no lines, the painter is an important part of the play. He's a symbol of the possibility of a new life, a rebuilding after tragedy. Miss <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> began writing `` Moonlight and Valentino'' four months after her husband's death. She finished the first draft in 19 days. `` I never let it alone,'' she says. `` I spent 10 hours a day on it.'' From March until November of last year, <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> plowed through nine full rewrites, something her father is famous for doing. `` The only thing I think she may have gotten from me is the attitude toward the work,'' says <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, who has had nearly two dozen plays and musicals produced on <LOCATION> Broadway </LOCATION>. His latest comedy, `` Rumors,'' has settled in for a long run at the Broadhurst Theater. Before the first performance, <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> told his daughter, `` I have a note pad and I'm going to take notes.'' `` He came up to me afterward and said, ` Here are my notes,''' Miss <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> recalls. `` It was a blank pad.'' Now the father ponders how his reputation will affect hers. `` She'll have to deal with it,'' he says. `` It's unfortunate, but it goes with the territory. She has no obligation to be the daughter of <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>. It's a hindrance to have attention taken away from what her work is. She does n't deserve that, and I do n't think it will happen once people see the play. `` I think she's going to write more plays,'' he adds. `` This is not going to be a one-shot playwright. She's just too good. There's so much in her.''

 Many of the main monuments glorify President <PERSON> Kim </PERSON>, who is hailed as the `` Great Leader,'' and promote his personality cult. At the northern entrance to the city, one monument similar to the <ORGANIZATION> Arch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Triumph </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> commemorates the 76-year-old <PERSON> Kim </PERSON>'s role in fighting <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, the colonial ruler of <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> until the end of World War II. Banners praising <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> are ubiquitous. Rising 560 feet above central <LOCATION> Pyongyang </LOCATION> is the Tower of the Juche Idea, erected for <PERSON> Kim </PERSON>'s 70th birthday. The Juche idea is <PERSON> Kim </PERSON>'s own interpreation of Marxism-Leninism and it stresses political and economic self-reliance. Officials talk with pride of the accomplishments <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> has made on its own. Tour guides point out the many new buildings in <LOCATION> Pyongyang </LOCATION>, reciting statistics on height, area and length of construction time. One guide surnamed <PERSON> Park </PERSON> said that people throughout the country of 20.7 million have been brought to <LOCATION> Pyongyang </LOCATION> to work on the youth festival projects. Park was unable to give exact figures, but a 1987 report in the <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong-based </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Far </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Review </ORGANIZATION> said 100,000 soldiers had been diverted to build the Kwangbok -LRB- Liberation -RRB- sports complex and other projects. Park said that the average monthly salary in <LOCATION> Pyongyang </LOCATION> is 150 won -LRB- $ 67 -RRB-. Housing, medical care, food and education are free or provided at a nominal charge. The <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> government puts the average monthly income of individual workers in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> at about $ 740. The North lags far behind the South in industry and foreign trade, with <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> joining <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> as the new economic dynamos of the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rim </LOCATION>. Foreign analysts put <LOCATION> Pyongyang </LOCATION>'s foreign debt at about $ 4.2 billion and <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> recently was declared in default of its overseas loans. Also troubling <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> is its image as having a ruthless government. <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> was blamed for an assassination attempt in October 1983 on then-President <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> <PERSON> Doo-hwan </PERSON> of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>. Several top <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> officials were killed. More recently, <LOCATION> Pyongyang </LOCATION> was accussed of planting a bomb on a South Korean jetliner that disappeared with 115 people over the <LOCATION> Andaman </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> near <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION> in November 1987. Before that, North Korean diplomats were expelled from several countries for smuggling goods to raise money to support their embassies _ in line with <PERSON> Kim </PERSON>'s philosophy of self-reliance. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Assistant Secretary of State <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Schifter </PERSON>, who heads the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION>, said in February that <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> is one of the worst violators of human rights. He claimed that <LOCATION> Pyongyang </LOCATION> `` tries really to turn people into automatons.'' Two <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> human rights organizations, <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Watch </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Minnesota </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lawyers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, recently published a report saying that the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> government `` consistently deprives citizens of basic human rights and freedoms.'' <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> clearly hopes visitors will go away with a different image. `` We are opening up because we want the world to know more about our country, that we do not arrest people or put people into prison for no reason,'' tour guide <PERSON> Park </PERSON> said.

 The first glimpse into the cult of President <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Il </PERSON> <PERSON> Sung </PERSON> comes as soon as visitors get off the plane at <LOCATION> Pyongyang </LOCATION>. They are greeted by a huge portrait of the leader for four decades atop the airport terminal. That is just the beginning. Many adults in <LOCATION> Pyongyang </LOCATION> wear <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> pins on their clothes. `` No one will choose not to wear the Great Leader's picture because we all respect him,'' a tour guide named <PERSON> Park </PERSON> told a group of visitors from <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>. When the visitors asked if they could get a <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> pin as a souvenir, tour guide <PERSON> Yoon </PERSON> <PERSON> Mu </PERSON> <PERSON> Ho </PERSON> responded: `` We can not give it or sell it to you because only followers of <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> and his Juche idea are entitled to wear this badge.'' The Juche idea is the 76-year-old <PERSON> Kim </PERSON>'s guiding philosophy of political and economic self-reliance. Universities, stadiums and squares are named after him. An impressive 65-foot bronze statue of <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> graces the <LOCATION> Pyongyang </LOCATION> city center. The country is dotted with buildings erected to celebrate his birthday -LRB- he was born April 15, 1912 -RRB- or to mark his achievements. At one model school shown to the visitors from <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, every classroom has a picture of <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> in a gold-colored frame. In a hotel in <LOCATION> Kaesong </LOCATION>, 80 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Pyongyang </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Kim </PERSON>'s picture is in every hotel room as well as the restaurant. The `` Great Leader'' also is a constant companion in train and subway stations, as well as in train and subway cars. In paintings portraying <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> receiving foreign visitors, he always stands confidently while the guests bow or approach him. None of the pictures show the disfiguring lump that bulges from his neck. The official <LOCATION> Pyongyang </LOCATION> Sinmun -LRB- <LOCATION> Pyongyang </LOCATION> News -RRB- uses slightly larger and darker type for <PERSON> Kim </PERSON>'s name, while his speeches are printed in bold letters. State-run television runs documentaries on his acheivements regularly. The capital is filled with banners and slogans wishing the `` Great Leader'' a healthy and long life. Asked what would happen if <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> were to die, tour guide <PERSON> Park </PERSON> said: `` We all hope the ` Great Leader' will live long. In our banquets our first toast is for the health and long life of the ` Great Leader'.'' <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Il </PERSON> <PERSON> Sung </PERSON> plans to hand power over to his eldest son, 47-year-old <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Jong </PERSON> <PERSON> Il </PERSON>, in what would be the world's first Communist dynasty. Official publications began praising the younger <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> in 1971, calling him `` Dear Leader.'' The Pyongyang News also uses larger type for <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Jong </PERSON> <PERSON> Il </PERSON>'s name and wished him a happy new year on Feb. 9, during the week of the Lunar New Year. In some places, his picture hangs beside his father's. In the official periodical <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> Today, Labor Hero <PERSON> Choe </PERSON> <PERSON> Hak </PERSON> <PERSON> Son </PERSON> described the role of <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Jong </PERSON> <PERSON> Il </PERSON> in building a chemical production complex. The president's son `` solved knotty problems and looked after our life well so that we could make miraculous achievements and perform heroic deeds in construction,'' he wrote. Even <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Il </PERSON> <PERSON> Sung </PERSON>'s parents and grandparents are glorified in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> as part of the `` revolutionary family.'' Tourists often are given a tour of Mangyongdae, the village where the leader was born and spent his childhood. Family pictures and farming tools used by his relatives are exhibited as a revolutionary guide praises each family member.

 Six years after a Socialist government took office, <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> has <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s fastest growing economy but also its highest unemployment rate. The new prosperity has roiled a once-staid <LOCATION> Spanish </LOCATION> society and widened the rift between haves an have-nots. Spaniards who once spurned ostentation now are frivolous, big spenders mesmerized by new financial wheeler-dealers and high-living politicians. The once-stagnant economy has boomed since 1986 at a European-high 4.5 percent annual growth rate but the unemployment rate has risen to 18.8 percent from 14.5 percent when the Socialists took over in 1982. Nearly every sector, including moribund steelmaking and shipbuilding, has returned to prosperity under Prime Minister <PERSON> Felipe </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON>'s market-oriented policies aimed at modernizing industry, moderating wage increases and curbing inflation. But the administration appears to have been caught off guard by growing popular anger over speculation, misuse of public funds and high living of Socialist officials. `` Spanish society has experienced many and deep changes in its structure and institutions in a very short time, and this has affected the value system in a special way,'' <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Diez </PERSON> <PERSON> Nicolas </PERSON>, sociology professor at <ORGANIZATION> Madrid </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, wrote in a recent newspaper column. By late 1985, the government's efforts to encourage domestic demand to spark an economic recovery started to take effect. Rocketing sales at <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corte </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ingles </ORGANIZATION> department store chain, whose green and white bags are a middle-class symbol, have made the company one of the nation's most profitable. Spaniards bought more than 1 million new cars last year, up 16 percent from 1987, and 30 percent of them were expensive imports. Corporate and bank profits have tripled and quadrupled, respectively, since 1986, while $ 16.7 billion from tourism last year set a new record for the third straight year. These revenues helped increase foreign currency reserves since December 1986 from $ 16 billion to $ 39.8 billion, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>. `` A cult of money and success like nothing we've ever seen has grown up in this country,'' says <PERSON> Miguel </PERSON> <PERSON> Roca </PERSON>, spokesman for the 19 deputies of the <ORGANIZATION> Catalan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Minority </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> in the 350-seat <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deputies </ORGANIZATION>, the lower house of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>. But the boom has left the country's 2.7 million jobless out in the cold and poverty remains widespread. The <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commissions </ORGANIZATION> became the bulwark of a social movement demanding the government focus on improving the lot of the estimated 8 million people living under the poverty line. Secretary General <PERSON> Nicolas </PERSON> <PERSON> Redondo </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, once a key <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> ally, has accused the Socialists of `` undermining public morality, the patrimony of the left.'' `` Before it was said that making money was creating wealth and jobs,'' he said. `` Now it is said that making money is an end in itself. We are putting aside values such as work, dedication and saving.'' <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> took office promising the country's 39 million people a higher standard for ethics in government. But criticism has rained down on his party following allegations that former administration members have peddled their influence as high-paid consultants to foreign investors. <PERSON> Pilar </PERSON> <PERSON> Miro </PERSON> resigned in disgrace as state television director after being forced to pay back nearly $ 35,000 of budget money she used for clothes to wear to public functions. The press questioned why the <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> bought Defense Minister <PERSON> Narcis </PERSON> <PERSON> Serra </PERSON> a baby grand piano for his <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION> apartment. Former Economic Minister <PERSON> Miguel </PERSON> <PERSON> Boyer </PERSON>, the architect of the successful Socialist austerity plan, raised public hackles with his hob-nobbing with the rich and fudging property assessments on a new residence he is building. Government spokeswoman <PERSON> Rosa </PERSON> <PERSON> Conde </PERSON> calls these incidents `` anecdotal.'' ` Socialists have shown sufficient honesty,'' she said, `` and the citizens know that.'' The influential <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bishops </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> has backed union charges and repeatedly criticized the government for creating an environment in which `` selfish materialism'' is held as superior to social solidarity. Public anger has also risen because of the strain on the country's already inadequate social services and infrastructure, which many claim have been neglected because of the government's desire to hold down public spending When government-union relations soured late last year, the unions called a general strike for Dec. 14 to pressure the government to make a `` move to the left.'' The strike shut down the country for a day as 8 million of the nation's 12 million workers stayed off the job. The strike stood Spanish politics on its head as the government found itself rejecting demands from a <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> union to which it has been intimately tied, while centrists and right-wing conservatives cheered the unions on. Six weeks of talks collapsed Feb. 7 with the unions rejecting as insufficient a government offer of $ 3.3 billion in unemployment, pension and minimum wage benefits over the next two years. More recently, rumors swirled that <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> would resign. Communists demanded that he step down, and centrists called for elections earlier than June 1990, when they are required. But when <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> delivered his annual state-of-the-union address Feb. 14, he assailed the unions for rejecting the government's $ 3.3 billion offer. Although a recent poll in the newsweekly <ORGANIZATION> Cambio </ORGANIZATION> 16 indicated that support for the Socialists had dropped to 35 percent from the 44 percent in 1986, <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> pledged to maintain his policies `` to sustain economic growth that is fundamental for the creation of jobs.'' Sociologist <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> Angeles </PERSON> <PERSON> Duran </PERSON> says the biggest change and the biggest problem caused by <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>'s much-heralded entry two years ago into the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> `` will be the change in values in a still profoundly Roman Catholic nation brought on by the growing influence here of individualist and mercantilist values flowing from Protestant northern <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>.'' The boom brought forth a new breed of young, aggressive entrepreneurs, bankers and financiers, some of whom have became household names by introducing the hostile takeover and merger deals to the staid Spanish business world. The Socialist administration encouraged new blood in top posts in business. It also encouraged giant bank mergers, even hostile ones, as necessary to improve <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>'s ability to meet competition that will come with the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION>'s removal of internal trade barriers by the end of 1992. Business news has overtaken stories of ideological politics in the serious newspapers Readership in the few business dailies has increased to the point where the papers themselves became targets for takeover by domestic and foreign investors. Spanish publishers plan to launch two more business newspapers this year. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION>, European and Japanese firms and investors have sought to create a base for <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> access in <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>, and many have bought out <LOCATION> Spanish </LOCATION> companies, entered joint-investment arrangements or built their own plants. Direct foreign investment exploded from 1983 to 1988, going from $ 1 billion to last year's $ 4 billion. But great fears remain that the Socialists' inability to reach accords with the unions will lead to demonstrations and strikes through the month of May. Already, top leaders of the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> are calling for a debate on whether it should maintain its traditional support for the Socialists in the next elections.

 The sandbags are gone in <LOCATION> Basra </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s second largest city, after years of battering by the Iranians in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> war. A new city is rising from the rubble. `` It's going to be the best city in <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>,'' said a bank manager, who identified himself only as <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>. `` Everything's going to be new.'' The scars of ferocious Iranian missile attacks and artillery bombardments are still everywhere: shrapnel-scarred buildings, groves of decapitated palm trees, abandoned tanks, sunken ships in the <LOCATION> Shatt-al-Arab </LOCATION> waterway that meanders through the city to the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>. But the souk, or market, is booming. The Sheraton Hotel on the bank of the muddy Shatt-Al-Arab, peppered by direct shell hits and deserted for the last two years, opened for business again in February. It was a dispute over territorial claims to the <LOCATION> Statt-al-Arab </LOCATION> that led to the war in 1980. The two daily flights from <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s capital, to <LOCATION> Basra </LOCATION>'s newly reopened airport are packed with businessmen, including construction engineers who have come to lobby officials for contracts On a recent visit, President <PERSON> Saddam </PERSON> <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> criticized the slow pace of rebuilding in a city that symbolized <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s defense against six years of Iranian offensives. `` The people of <LOCATION> Basra </LOCATION> deserve their city to be beautiful and more organized,'' he said. His government has pledged $ 5 billion to repair the damage and make <LOCATION> Basra </LOCATION> the centerpiece of a new international industrial zone. Founded 1,400 years ago and known as the <LOCATION> Venice </LOCATION> of the East because of its network of canals, <LOCATION> Basra </LOCATION> was <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s main port with a prewar population of 1.5 million. It is just 15 miles from <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>'s Iranian forces battled to within six miles of <LOCATION> Basra </LOCATION>'s eastern outskirts in early 1987, putting it within easy artillery range. In the bombardments, 90 percent of <LOCATION> Basra </LOCATION>'s buildings were destroyed or damaged. Thousands of civilians were killed or wounded and thousands more fled. The port is still blocked because the <PERSON> Shatt </PERSON> <PERSON> Al-Arab </PERSON> is an issue in the Iran-Iraq peace talks. The first major construction project nearby is 23 new piers for what were minor ports at Um Qasr and <PERSON> Khour </PERSON> el-Zubiar before the war. The main work in <LOCATION> Basra </LOCATION> since the Aug. 20 cease-fire has been clearing the wreckage. <PERSON> Arfan </PERSON>, one of the engineers looking for contracts in <LOCATION> Basra </LOCATION>, noted: `` Right now they're just cleaning up, but by the end of the year there will be lots of work in <LOCATION> Basra </LOCATION>.'' Heavy trucks, graders and cranes _ many of them from the military _ growl through downtown. Hundreds of new apartment buildings, ringed by fields of mud, have gone up. Many were occupied even before they were completed, with residents using corrugated iron sheets to cover the still-empty windows. In the souk, merchants say they ca n't keep up with consumer demand, even though prices have gone up by as much as 25 percent. `` We're selling more and more,'' said <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Aslan </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohsen </PERSON>, who runs an appliances store. At the Sheraton Hotel, manager <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Meuree </PERSON>, a Belgian, said it took two days of cleaning the rugs before the colors started to emerge from the dust. The sign above the entrance hangs askew and the acne of artillery hits across the front of the building is still visible under concrete patches. <PERSON> Meuree </PERSON> said 99 percent of the damage from several direct hits has been repaired, and 130 out of the 210 rooms reopened. Visitors from <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> come for the weekend. Many want rooms looking out over three sunken freighters in the Shatt-al-Arab, the estuary of the <LOCATION> Tigris </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Euphrates </LOCATION> rivers that runs into the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>. At least 70 ships are stranded there. `` Unfortunately there are n't enough rooms on the river to satisfy everyone,'' said <PERSON> Meuree </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Basra </LOCATION> had a prewar reputation for serendipity as Kuwaits escaping their nation's alcohol ban made it their weekend watering hole. `` They're coming back slowly, it's not like before,'' said <PERSON> Khamis </PERSON>, the Sheraton's bartender, who estimated that he serves 50 people every weekend night. `` They come to drink, to enjoy themselves.'' Down the road from the Sheraton a new nightclub has opened, surrounded by a wall of plants and black statues of naked women. In the neighborhood behind it, residents said everyone who fled the shelling is back. <PERSON> Dawla </PERSON>, a 49-year-old mother of seven, fled in 1986 after bombs shattered every window in the house and killed a man praying in the neighborhood mosque. The house was missing walls and was partially looted when she came back after the cease-fire, but it's been rebuilt. `` If there's a war again I'll never leave my house,'' she said.

 _ In <LOCATION> Yakima </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> office covering 11 largely rural counties made 143 arrests last year. `` The only thing that keeps it from being greater is manpower and money,'' <PERSON> Dreisbach </PERSON> said. _ In <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, three Americans and six Panamians last year were convicted of or pleaded guilty to importing about 161 kilos of cocaine from <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, via <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> planes, commercial flights or mail packages sent to <LOCATION> Moultrie </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ga </LOCATION>. The drugs were then sent to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, officials said. Three of the nine had Army ties. `` This case is about as hometown as you can get,'' said <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Malarney </PERSON>, agent-in-charge of the <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> office in <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ga. </LOCATION> `` You'd expect a big city to have these problems But this is a small southern town and here, you were having cocaine delivered in the mail!'' Despite the large number of arrests, most rural drug cases are smaller, but still take considerable manpower. In <LOCATION> Dodge </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minn. </LOCATION>, for instance, undercover officers spent three months arranging the purchase of 25 pounds of marijuana from two men, who were charged in December. Prosecutors acknowledge many of these cases would n't make it into urban drug-clogged courts. `` A lot of what we do here would n't be prosecuted in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> prosecutor. `` A kilo of cocaine is of no special significance for <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> or a border state.'' There are other differences. Rural authorities do n't have to contend with heavily armed big-city gangs and may benefit from small-town residents less tolerant of drug dens in their towns. Ironically, though, the everybody-knows-everybody network makes it harder for undercover agents to operate. Even on rural roads they're quickly noticed. `` It's harder to sneak up on the guy,'' <PERSON> Malarney </PERSON> said. `` You're talking about a quarter of a mile between houses and there's one road. But small-town dealers also know how to be inconspicuous. `` They do n't drive a Cadillac,'' <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> said. `` They'll drive a pickup truck. You do n't see diamonds and gold ... Everybody knows them for 20 miles. How can they show up with a $ 20,000 car and build a $ 100,000 house? They're just socking it away.'' `` If people think they can move to rural areas to get away from drugs, they're wrong,'' he added. `` There's no place else to go anymore.''

 Two years ago, author <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Wambaugh </PERSON> was intrigued by newspaper accounts about how the murderer of two teen-age girls in <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> was discovered through a new process of identification called genetic fingerprinting. The writer of the best-selling police stories, `` The Onion Field'' and `` The Choir Boys,'' headed for <LOCATION> Leicester </LOCATION>, the English city where the murders took place. He conducted extensive interviews with local police, the victims' families and others, and used the information for the basis of his new book, `` The Blooding'' -LRB- $ 18.95, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Morrow </PERSON> -RRB-, a non-fictional account of what happened. But the book's graphic details of the rapes and murders of <PERSON> Lynda </PERSON> <PERSON> Mann </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dawn </PERSON> <PERSON> Ashworth </PERSON> have prompted <LOCATION> Leicester </LOCATION> police to look into how <PERSON> Wambaugh </PERSON> acquired his information. They said `` The Blooding'' contains `` distasteful'' details that could cause further distress to the families involved. <PERSON> Wambaugh </PERSON> seemed visibly shaken by the investigation when he talked about the issue in a recent interview. `` It's very upsetting, it's keeping me up at nights,'' said the 52-year-old writer. `` I'm worried that the parents, once they start down the slope of publicly complaining about the treatment of their private lives, will not be able to retreat back to common sense when they read and understand what I've done.'' Chief Constable <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Hirst </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> Leicester </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> police has written to the book's British publishers, <PERSON> Bantam </PERSON>, about the book's closely detailed description of the attacks on <PERSON> Mann </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ashworth </PERSON>, both 15 when they died The parents of one of the girls had complained to <PERSON> Hirst </PERSON>, and to avoid any suggestion that the police endorsed the book, <PERSON> Hirst </PERSON> asked <PERSON> Bantam </PERSON> to remove an acknowledgment of the constabulary's help from the book. <PERSON> Bantam </PERSON> said <PERSON> Hirst </PERSON>'s letter arrived after the book was printed, and it was too late to remove the acknowledgment. <PERSON> Wambaugh </PERSON> contacted <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> and <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Ashworth </PERSON> but has been unable to alleviate the situation. `` I'm trying desperately,'' he said. `` I've written two letters and have gotten one response, which was not good from my point of view. I just feel that <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> Ashworth </PERSON> has gone down the road too far with the poisoned atmosphere and will be unable to read the work objectively. `` As we sat and talked together, repeatedly they uttered the same things, that it's not knowing that's the most awful thing. Very often we let our imaginations run wild and if we know we can lay the ghosts to rest and finish it off. Well I told them what happened.'' On the evening of Nov. 21, 1983, <PERSON> Mann </PERSON> was raped and murdered in the village of Narborough while walking down a dark footpath called the `` Black Pad.'' Despite an exhaustive police investigation, the murderer was not captured and the incident faded into the background. But nearly three years later the killer struck again, this time in broad daylight, when <PERSON> Dawn </PERSON> <PERSON> Ashworth </PERSON> was raped and murdered while walking on a village footpath called `` Ten Pound Lane.'' Police received a tip about the suspicious behavior of a kitchen porter, a confession was obtained and the case seemed to be finally settled. However, the kitchen porter's father had read about a scientific breakthrough called genetic fingerprinting, developed in the mid-1980s by <LOCATION> Leicester </LOCATION> geneticist <PERSON> Alec </PERSON> <PERSON> Jeffreys </PERSON>, who discovered that every person's blood or semen has a genetic code as distinctive as a fingerprint. A sample of the kitchen porter's blood was taken and the test showed that his genetic print did not match the semen samples taken from the bodies of the two girls. The police launched a massive `` blooding'' program, testing every male in the vicinity who was born between Jan. 1, 1953 and Dec. 31, 1970. When an employee at a local bakery revealed that he had been persuaded by <PERSON> Colin </PERSON> <PERSON> Pitchfork </PERSON>, a co-worker, to take the test for him, police tracked down the suspect. <PERSON> Pitchfork </PERSON> was tested and charged with the murders. <PERSON> Wambaugh </PERSON> tells the story in a matter-of-fact manner. The rapes are depicted in detail, reading like a well prepared police report. There is no real `` message'' in `` The Blooding,'' outside of how genetic fingerprinting could revolutionize crime detection and that <PERSON> Pitchfork </PERSON> was a sociopath, incapable of feeling remorse for the crimes. `` If there was one single British writer doing a book I was going to back off. I thought, ` It's their country, their story and one of them should do it. I did n't want to be some carpetbagging Yank.'' But the author did n't anticipate certain cultural differences, especially the British need for privacy. `` They are reticent people who consider keeping one's mouth shut a major virtue. With Americans, once they start you ca n't shut them up. But the Brits are different. I spent a lot of money on drinks for a lot of people to get information I needed. I've done a book that they're not familiar with. They do n't like non-fiction crime; it does not sell well in <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Wambaugh </PERSON>'s own interest in the genre came from reading Truman Capote's 1965 classic, `` In Cold Blood.'' `` There was his book and there were n't too many others,'' <PERSON> Wambaugh </PERSON> said. `` I was impressed that it could be written exactly in the style of a novel and be exactly true journalistically.'' <PERSON> Wambaugh </PERSON>, the son of a police officer, lived in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION> until he was 14 and his family moved to <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. At age 20, he developed an interest in literature but decided to become a cop because he needed a job and the pay was good. But he did n't give up his desire to write. `` The everyday policeman's routine is very rarely exciting and very rarely satisfying,'' <PERSON> Wambaugh </PERSON> said. `` But when I'd get home at night or daytime, depending on the shift I worked, I started on that typewriter. Then I was challenged.'' His first novel, `` The New Centurions,'' was released in 1971. Based on his own experiences, it was a fictionalized account of a <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> policeman's first five years on the force, culminating with the 1965 race riots in <LOCATION> Watts </LOCATION>. The book sold well and his next novel, `` The Blue Knight,'' did even better, selling over 1 million copies in paperback alone. `` The Onion Field,'' released in 1973, was a non-fictional story about the murder of a police officer in an isolated onion field near <LOCATION> Bakersfield </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>. A critical and commercial success, <PERSON> Wambaugh </PERSON> considered `` The Onion Field'' a major breakthrough `` From ` Onion Field' on I've really grown,'' said <PERSON> Wambaugh </PERSON>, who retired from the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> police force in March 1973 after 13 years on the force. He has written 11 books, seven fiction and four non-fiction. `` They're both true kinds of writing. Stylistically, I write the same. I learned that from Capote; you can write the same as long as you have integrity and do n't start writing fiction in a non-fiction story.''

<HEAD>At The Movies: ``Cousins,'' ``Tap''</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DOLORES BARCLAY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Arts Editor</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 `` Cousins'' It is indeed a sad indictment of the <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> movie machine to see its growing reliance on foreign films as a source for new American movies. The adaptation market seems frenzied these days with such remakes as `` Three Men and a Baby'' and `` Three Fugitives.'' It seems the creative and innovative spark of the world's greatest movie institution has died. The latest redo is `` Cousins,'' <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> <PERSON> Schumacher </PERSON>'s graceless treatment of <PERSON> Jean-Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Tacchella </PERSON>'s charming 1976 comedy, `` Cousin, <LOCATION> Cousine </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Schumacher </PERSON> makes the mistake of trying to closely follow the original. Both open with a rousing family wedding scene in which the husband and wife of two different couples meet, run off for a little sexual fling and leave their respective mates waiting at the catering hall for their returns. The cuckholded spouses start up a harmless flirtation and friendship and eventually have an affair of their own. But where the original danced lightly with the passions and eccentricities of <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> culture, the new version applies the thin, moralistic veneer of an American TV sitcom with idiot level dialogue and conviction. Simply put, the French have a different way of viewing adultery. <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Danson </PERSON>, as compelling in this role as a bottle of warm, flat champagne, plays <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Kozinski </PERSON> who is married to <PERSON> Tish </PERSON>, played with airhead finesse by <PERSON> Sean </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON>. <PERSON> Isabella </PERSON> <PERSON> Rossellini </PERSON>, perhaps cast in this movie to give it some sort of continental class and a little sunshine, is <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> Hardy </PERSON>, an understanding wife and mother married to a brutish bore named <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> -LRB- <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Petersen </PERSON> -RRB- who sells <PERSON> Suburus </PERSON> but who likes to say he sells BMWs. The truly comic moments -LRB- which were many in `` Cousin, <LOCATION> Cousine </LOCATION>'' -RRB- are diluted in `` Cousins'' by weighty and blunt situations: When <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> realizes <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> and <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> are also having an affair, he confronts <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> in typical <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> macho style with, `` If you go near my wife again, I'll kill you.'' <PERSON> Petersen </PERSON> is more <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Flintstone </PERSON> than <PERSON> Valentino </PERSON>. What saves `` Cousins'' from utter and total oblivion is the wonderful patter between <PERSON> Larry </PERSON>'s father -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Lloyd </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bridges </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- and his son, <PERSON> Mitch </PERSON> -LRB- <PERSON> Keith </PERSON> <PERSON> Coogan </PERSON> -RRB-. Grandpa and grandson have a bucolic moment over some girlie magazines, and the scene in which <PERSON> Mitch </PERSON> helps grandpa <PERSON> Vince </PERSON> prepare for a date with <PERSON> Maria </PERSON>'s mother -LRB- <PERSON> Norma </PERSON> <PERSON> Aleandro </PERSON> -RRB- is worth the ticket price and popcorn. A totally unnecessary addition to `` Cousins'' is the subplot involving the boy-girl problems <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> and <PERSON> Maria </PERSON>'s daughter is having in pre-school. Who cares? Perhaps Hollywood will one day realize that some things get lost in translation. One would think the lesson would have been learned in 1983 when <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> McBride </PERSON> remade <PERSON> Jean-Luc </PERSON> <PERSON> Godard </PERSON>'s classic 1960 film `` Breathless'' into a pathethic and misguided movie. It starred <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gere </PERSON>, who was embarrassing as he attempted to take on the role <PERSON> Jean-Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Belmondo </PERSON> had created in the original. Something gets lost in the translation as <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> puts its neon wand to French confections. If it ai n't broke, then do n't fix it ... `` Cousins,'' a Paramount Pictures release produced by <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Allyn </PERSON>, is rated PG-13.

 `` Tap'' Movie audiences have yearned for those splashy, joyous, romantic musicals of the 1930s,'40s and'50s when boy met girl, boy lost girl, boy got girl back and everybody lived happily everafter, dancing all the way to the altar. <PERSON> Nick </PERSON> <PERSON> Castle </PERSON>, whose father choreographed many of those wonderful <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Astaire-Ginger </PERSON> <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON> vehicles, attempts to bring back those golden dance movies with `` Tap,'' a love letter to hoofers great and small. Starring <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON> <PERSON> Hines </PERSON> and some of the greatest tap kings living, `` Tap'' features excellent dancing and a splendid exuberance. Unfortunately, the movie holds back; the dance sequences never seem to totally reach their potential. One production number, in which <PERSON> Hines </PERSON> takes a club full of tap fans out to Times Square to feel and hear the beat and rhythms of the city -LRB- such as cars going over metal plates in the road or construction crews thumping the pavement -RRB- and marks out a dance. The number starts out well, luring the viewer to the rhythms and moves. Then it fizzles. Another disappointment is the wistful roof-top soft shoe performed by <PERSON> Hines </PERSON> and the lovely <PERSON> Suzzanne </PERSON> <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> to `` Cheek to Cheek.'' It's a romantic <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> and Ginger take-off that never really gets off. How sad. The biggest problem with `` Tap'' is Castle's script and story line. <PERSON> Max </PERSON> -LRB- <PERSON> Hines </PERSON> -RRB- is a genius dancer who unfortunately finds second-story work more to his liking than hoofing. After a stint in jail, he returns to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> where he hooks up with the hoods again. At the same time, his mentor, <PERSON> Little </PERSON> <PERSON> Mo </PERSON> -LRB- <PERSON> Sammy </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> -RRB- encourages him to resume his dancing and even tries to turn him on to a new tap innovation _ amplified shoes. The plot, though, gets in the way of the dancing. It's not compelling, poignant or interesting enough. The tap dancing, however, is. <PERSON> Hines </PERSON>, perhaps the greatest contemporary tap stylist around these days, is marvelous. His supporting cast includes <PERSON> Savion </PERSON> <PERSON> Glover </PERSON>, a 14-year-old hoofer who one day will make the same claim. There are also <PERSON> Sandman </PERSON> <PERSON> Sims </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bunny </PERSON> <PERSON> Briggs </PERSON>, <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Slyde </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Steve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Condos </ORGANIZATION> _ some of the dancers who helped define and perfect the art and craft of tap during the 20th century. And <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON>, who learned how to tap for the movie, is quite good for a newcomer. Forget about the story. See `` Tap'' as a tribute to the great ones and to appreciate what tap dancing was all about before Broadway and <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> took away its snap and crackle. Produced by <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Adelson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Vane </PERSON>, the Tri-Star Pictures release is rated PG-13.

 `` Married to the Mob'' -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Orion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Video </ORGANIZATION>. VHS-Beta, $ 89.98, Rated R -RRB- This delightful comedy should not be missed on the little screen if you did n't see it in theatrical release. <PERSON> Angela </PERSON>, the anguished, beauty school-dropout wife of Mafia soldier <PERSON> Frankie </PERSON> <PERSON> the </PERSON> <PERSON> Pickle </PERSON>, surveys the crated TV sets in her too-plush, <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> living room and wails, `` Everything we own fell off a truck!'' So there's trouble in Paradise. <PERSON> Frankie </PERSON> is fooling around, her son is scamming the neighborhood kids at three-card monte, and all her creep friends are gangsters' wives `` I want a divorce,'' sobs <PERSON> Angela </PERSON> -LRB- <PERSON> Michelle </PERSON> <PERSON> Pfeiffer </PERSON> -RRB-. <PERSON> Frankie </PERSON> laughs. You do n't divorce the Mob. Next thing you know, <PERSON> Angela </PERSON>'s a widow and <PERSON> Frankie </PERSON>'s ex-boss, capo <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> the Tiger -LRB- Dean <PERSON> Stockwell </PERSON> -RRB- is sniffing around her weeds. This is not lost on <PERSON> Tony </PERSON>'s insanely jealous wife, Connie -LRB- Mercedes Ruehl -RRB-, or the handsome, young, clean-cut <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agent -LRB- <PERSON> Matthew </PERSON> <PERSON> Modine </PERSON> -RRB- who's out to nail <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> the Tiger. This is when things start to get complicated. `` Married to the Mob,'' directed by <PERSON> Jonathaan </PERSON> <PERSON> Demme </PERSON>, screenplay by <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Strugatz </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Burns </PERSON>, is a genuinely hilarious movie that is full of bravura performances by actors at the height of their powers. <PERSON> Pfeiffer </PERSON>, who played the icy blond bimbo in `` Scarface'' and the love interest in `` Tequila Sunrise,'' is more luminously beautiful than ever. Her character conveys a tough, smart, innocent vulnerability that is magic. <PERSON> Stockwell </PERSON>'s portrayal of clever, weasely <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> deserved his Academy Award nomination -LRB- as did his lunatic cameo as <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON> in `` Tucker'' -RRB-. So did <PERSON> Mercedes </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruehl </PERSON>, whose crazed Connie adds a joyously funny intensity to the action. Ever since `` Citzens' Band'' -LRB- as well as `` <PERSON> Melvin </PERSON> and Howard'' or `` Stop Making Sense'' or `` Swimming to <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>'' -RRB-, <PERSON> Demme </PERSON> has been making important American movies. In `` Married to the Mob'' he makes one that is pure fun. Aces.

 `` Bellman and True'' -LRB- Cannon Video. VHS-Beta, $ 89.95. Rated R -RRB- Run out and borrow, rent or buy this one. It was my favorite video of 1988. It's an unrelentingly tense caper movie that inexorably notches up the tension, yet has at its center a beautiful and moving story of a father and son. <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Hill </PERSON> plays a burned-out alcoholic, a computer systems engineer who takes a bribe to deliver a mysterious computer file to a cheeky, new-breed <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> `` villain'' -LRB- <PERSON> Derek </PERSON> <PERSON> Newark </PERSON> -RRB- and his henchmen. The engineer and his stepson -LRB- <PERSON> Kieran </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Brien </PERSON> -RRB- are held prisoner until the file is interpreted, and it turns out to be the cash flow reports and electronic schematic to the ultra-secure branch bank serving Heathrow Airport. Suddenly it is too late to back out. The gang needs a `` bellman'' to handle the bank's electronics. And there is a share of $ 25 million. `` Your life's a bit gray, these days, is n't it, darling?'' says the cheeky thug. Considered only for its ingenious caper, `` Bellman and True'' would be a worthwhile movie, but the relationship of the father and son is equally important, heightening the sense of value, risk and loss. Novelist <PERSON> Desmond </PERSON> <PERSON> Lowden </PERSON> wrote the tight, fast-paced screenplay from his book with director <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Loncraine </PERSON> with <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Wearing </PERSON>. <PERSON> Loncraine </PERSON>'s headlong direction utterly crisp, atmospheric and breathless enough to get you on the edge of your seat. The cast is superlative, every one. Highest recommendation.

 `` Flashpoint'' -LRB- GRP Records -RRB- _ <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Saxophonist </PERSON> <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> has played, it seems, with everybody. A short list of those he's backed includes Barbra Streisand, <PERSON> Steely </PERSON> <PERSON> Dan </PERSON>, <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> McCartney </PERSON> and <PERSON> Joni </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>. He has written scores for movies and even the themes for two 1970s TV shows, `` Starsky and Hutch'' and `` The Streets of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>.'' In between such projects, <PERSON> Scott </PERSON>, sometimes with his ever-changing band the <ORGANIZATION> L.A. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION>, has found time to make solo records of lightweight jazz-rock fusion, meticulously produced and somewhat devoid of any spark. The same holds true for `` Flashpoint.'' The opening cut, `` Get a Grip,'' sets the tone for the album, with its uptempo melody, overdubbed saxophone solos and shifty rhythm. <PERSON> Scott </PERSON>'s penchant for overdubbing tenor and alto saxes creates a fuller sound but prevents him from straying too far from the melody, robbing his solos of spontaneity. `` Lost in Love'' and `` Night Drifter'' are both moodier, slower pieces that showcase <PERSON> Scott </PERSON>'s tenor sax runs, while the title cut is the most adventurous, with its synthesizer-saxophone harmony and machine-like rhythm. <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> is a talented composer, producer and sideman, but as a solo act he shows little imagination. His music, while pleasant enough, begs for something to set it apart from the crowd. _ By <PERSON> Curt </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> Writer.

 `` T-Shirt'' -LRB- Epic -RRB- _ The Crickets The first album in years by The Crickets is an unexpected little pleasure, especially if it is approached without lofty expectations. Former Buddy Holly sidekicks J.I. <PERSON> Allison </PERSON> and <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Mauldin </PERSON> are joined on `` T-Shirt'' by singer-guitarist <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> Payne </PERSON> for 10 songs that, happily, do n't lapse into sentimental reminiscences or futile attempts to recreate the late rocker's magic. They do a good job playing breezy, good-time rock' n' roll, the sort of thing <PERSON> Holly </PERSON> might be doing today had he lived -LRB- and stopped progressing musically -RRB- past 1959. It's unpretentious, fun and instantly likeable. One song rises above the rest _ the <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> McCartney-produced </PERSON> title cut. It's the most overtly Holly-esque song here, with an irresistible hand-clapping, guitar-strumming chorus: `` Do n't tell me that love hurts-I read the book, I saw the movie, got the T-shirt.'' The Crickets also poke fun at themselves in the bouncy `` Three Piece,'' noting how many musicians have been in and out of the band since <PERSON> Holly </PERSON> split from the group shortly before his death. There have been, they sing, `` more Crickets than a dog's got fleas, but we've cut it down to a three-piece.'' Then, noting the advantages of a smaller group, `` The overhead's down and the money's increased. Such high points are not sustained over the entire album, though, and the sappy ballad `` The Weekend'' and the unnecessary car song `` Cruise in It'' threaten to drag things down. But The Crickets make up in spirit for the few weak spots, making `` T-Shirt'' a well-fitting, comfortable record. _ By <PERSON> Marc </PERSON> <PERSON> Rice </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> Writer.

 `` More Than Friends'' -LRB- Jive -RRB- _ <PERSON> Jonathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Butler </PERSON> <PERSON> Jonathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Butler </PERSON> is the kind of guy we all used to hate in school. <PERSON> Butler </PERSON> is handsome, sings well, plays a mean guitar and writes catchy songs. He probably played on the football team, too. <PERSON> Butler </PERSON> puts his musical talents to good use on `` More Than Friends,'' a collection of 10 tunes that contains few clinkers. The record is mostly pop, part r & amp; b and a little bit of jazz. Because of <PERSON> Butler </PERSON>'s scat singing and the way he rips through acoustic guitar licks, his sound is a bit reminiscent of <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Benson </PERSON>. The opening cuts, `` There's One Born Every Minute -LRB- I'm a Sucker for You -RRB-'' and `` Breaking Away,'' both swing and swagger with a smile. The mood remains upbeat the rest of the way, with other highlights including the instrumentals `` Take Me Home'' and `` <PERSON> Sekona </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Butler </PERSON> even turns a few neat phrases, as seen on `` She's a Teaser'': `` She'll call you up at 2 a.m., says she wants some company; I tell you this from experience, the only thing you'll do all night is watch TV. It's some consolation that <PERSON> Butler </PERSON> occasionally has trouble with girls. _ By <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Wine </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> Writer.

<HEAD>Star Watch: The Shy Tom Selleck</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BOB THOMAS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Selleck </PERSON> shy? `` I think so, yeah,'' he says. `` I was terribly shy all my life, not just as a kid. An awful lot of actors I know are shy.'' That may help explain part of his enduring appeal, first in eight seasons and eternal reruns as television's `` Magnum, P.I.'' and now as the big-screen star of `` Three Men and a Baby'' and the current `` Her Alibi.'' He may display the outward appearance of a movie hero, but there's an underlying uncertainty that beguiles women and reassures men. <PERSON> Selleck </PERSON>'s candid appraisal: `` I do n't see myself as others do. People tell me, ` You're willing to play with your macho image, you're willing to play with that. Well, I never tried to project a macho image. `` In fact, I'm six feet, four inches tall. I've been taller than most people most of my adult life. I see no reason to run around trying to intimidate people with that. I've always kind of gone the other way.'' Such an approach seems to be the way for his film career to go. During hiatus time of the early `` Magnum,'' he starred in three films of the heroic mode, `` High Road to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>,'' `` <PERSON> Lassiter </PERSON>,'' `` Runaway.'' All were disappointments, though not the dismal failures some critics claimed. `` Three Men and a Baby'' and to a lesser extent, `` Her Alibi,'' indicate that the key to <PERSON> Selleck </PERSON>'s film success lies in stressing his fallibilities. The new film casts him as a mystery writer who becomes involved in a spy plot involving a Romanian exchange student, played by model <PERSON> Paulina </PERSON> <PERSON> Porizkova </PERSON>. `` It's a change of pace for me,'' <PERSON> Selleck </PERSON> remarked. `` There's a lot more physical comedy in this picture, and yet as silly as the picture gets, it's the kind of comedy which I think you have to play absolutely for real.'' The director is <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Beresford </PERSON>, the Australian who has made `` Tender Mercies,'' `` Crimes of the Heart'' and other films in this country. `` Bruce seems to be able to translate the American ethic on film,'' <PERSON> Selleck </PERSON> observed. `` I've gotten to know many Aussies in <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>, and I think there's a certain kinship between the two countries. Maybe it's because we're both kind of young civilizations in the historical context.'' <PERSON> Selleck </PERSON> has completed the transition to films with a hefty salary. His reported fee for `` Her Alibi'' is $ 4 million. Has this resulted from some grand plan on his part? `` I do n't think I had the ability to be that calculated,'' he said. `` I had some instincts, and one picture led to a certain kind of logic for what I would do next. `` I was concerned about it. I was pretty defensive about pictures I had done. My stock was pretty good all during ` Magnum,' but it was n't perceived that way with my first three pictures. I think it's because they were n't successful in the same magnitude as ` Magnum. `` The offers kept getting better all during ` Magnum,' but nobody knew it,'' he said. `` The questions I was asked changed even before ` Three Men and a Baby' started making money. The questions implied that I had successfully made the transition.'' Growing up shy in the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fernando </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Selleck </PERSON> never had a desire to become an actor. `` I never did a school play, I never did anything,'' he declared. `` I got into -LRB- acting -RRB- because I grew up in the town where the business centered, and somebody said, ` You ought to try commercials.' `` I thought you could make money at it, good money for very little work. After I tried it, I liked it.'' Cigarette commercials and ads led to a contract at 20th Century <PERSON> Fox </PERSON>, where he learned his craft. He freelanced in television, then landed at Universal, which cast him in seven failed pilots until `` Magnum, P.I.'' <PERSON> Selleck </PERSON> remains at Universal, occupying a suite of offices with his production company. Among his projects is producing a new television series for his friend <PERSON> Burt </PERSON> <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON>. Last Dec. 16, <PERSON> Selleck </PERSON>'s wife, actress-singer <PERSON> Jillie </PERSON> <PERSON> Mack </PERSON>, gave birth to their first child, <PERSON> Hannah </PERSON>. The 44-year-old father remains exultant. `` <PERSON> Hannah </PERSON> is great,'' he said. `` The main reason I thought it was time to end ` <ORGANIZATION> Magnum </ORGANIZATION>' was that I felt my priorities were a little off. While I thought it was well worth making the sacrifice of putting work ahead of family for an opportunity like ` Magnum,' I'd been doing it long enough. To take care of the new family, he bought a 60-acre ranch in the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fernando </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> as well as a home closer to town, in <LOCATION> Mandeville </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canyon </LOCATION>. Will there be a `` Three Men and a Baby II''? `` Yeah. And they -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- postponed it, which to me is a real vote of confidence. It's encouraging, because I think a lot of studios would consider their investors and say, ` Why delay it? You could do anything and make a hundred million dollars.' `` I think Disney truly does feel this is kind of a benchmark for them, a touchstone, and they want to take care of it,'' he said. `` So when they said, ` We're willing to forego next Christmas to make the script better,' it says to me they want to make a sequel that's better than the first, as opposed to ripping off the audience.

<DATELINE>BLY, Ore. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Ask <PERSON> Ned </PERSON> <PERSON> Livingston </PERSON> what he does and even he has a hard time deciding what it is, exactly. There's what he calls `` this stuff'': the chairs and other furniture he whittles in fluid designs, which sell for big money in fashionable art galleries in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. Then there's what he calls `` the land'': the old <ORGANIZATION> Gerber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ranch </ORGANIZATION>, which he and his wife inherited with its pastures to irrigate, and timber to manage. And there are the fish in the pond in front of the house, which need a handful of chopped liver now and then; the red-legged partridges, which he released into <LOCATION> Miller </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Creek </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canyon </LOCATION>; and the <ORGANIZATION> Klamath </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Planning </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, on which he serves as a member. `` You are talking to a guy who is not particularly sure what woman he is married to, the furniture or the land,'' <PERSON> Livingston </PERSON> said one winter's day at his home, which he built in a meadow surrounded by ponderosa pine and juniper at the foot of Horsefly Mountain. `` And I'm not particularly worried about it.'' <PERSON> Livingston </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Marilyn </PERSON>, were both born and raised in this high desert country east of the Cascade Range: <PERSON> Ned </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Klamath </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Falls </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Marilyn </PERSON> on the old <ORGANIZATION> Gerber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ranch </ORGANIZATION>, which is a good 1 -LCB- - hour drive from the city `` We came back here -LRB- in the 1950s -RRB- after college for a year or two,'' he said. `` Then we went to the big city looking for a big architecture job. `` If I had proceeded professionally, I would have stayed in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. But we kept coming back and coming back. Finally, I said, ` Let's quit looking for ourselves and do what we really want to do.''' So they moved back to the ranch. <PERSON> Livingston </PERSON> started gluing up pieces of oak and walnut and using a horseshoe rasp to shape free-flowing chairs, cradles, music stands, benches, coat racks, library ladders and bar stools. The ones he did n't sell stayed home. It has taken some years to get six chairs around the dining table. `` In the'60s I was really hot,'' <PERSON> Livingston </PERSON> recalled. `` I was going to burn up the art world with these things. I had a piece in the Renwick Gallery at the Smithsonian. The point is I had stuff around the country. Maybe I would sell a piece here, a piece there. `` It has n't built into the kind of thing where I did n't need to worry about a monthly income. Then comes the estate breaking up. I had been involved in the operation of this ranch. So the last four or five years I've let this stuff slide. I've worked on irrigating the south 40 or thinning timber. `` The land is definitely a conflict with this other stuff,'' he said. `` Most people are n't so fortunate to have that problem. It would be stupid of me to neglect it.'' <PERSON> Livingston </PERSON> proudly recites the history of his land, which was assembled by cattlemen _ first <PERSON> Horsefly </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> and later the Gerber brothers _ in the late 1800s out of small homesteads too poor to support a family. <PERSON> Marilyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Livingston </PERSON> drives about 15 miles on a cinder road to get to the little logging community of <PERSON> Bly </PERSON>, where she teaches school. They lease the pastureland for grazing and <PERSON> Ned </PERSON> is working on expanding the irrigation network to produce more summer grass. He recently cruised several hundred acres of timber. Where the logging outfit wanted to cut all the mature timber, <PERSON> Livingston </PERSON> left enough of the big trees to generate new ones and maintain the diversity of the forest. With 20 inches of snow on the ground, he's been able to get back to what he calls the wood whittling. `` My furniture tries to conform to the shape of the human body. It ends up kind of sculptural. `` One of the hardest things to make is a chair. <PERSON> Vitruvius </PERSON> -LRB- a Roman architect from the first century, B.C. -RRB- said a building should accomplish three things: firmness, commodity and delight. What is a chair but the same three things?'' <PERSON> Livingston </PERSON> has been working on improving his dining chair, which he considers his signature work and abstractly calls to mind the sandhill cranes that breed nearby. `` The bad thing is the scoop seat makes it hard to get in and out of,'' he says. The sketch of his latest idea is in the middle of his notes from a meeting where a state planning official explained some new regulations aimed at stopping the fragmentation of <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>'s farm and forest lands. In his shop, an early chair, a prototype for a collasible cathouse, jigs, horse collars, bicycles and a small hydroplane one of his two sons built hang from the ceiling. On a work bench, a portable radio propped on a milk can plays classical music. At another bench, <PERSON> Livingston </PERSON> is free-forming a curved lamination that will form the splayed legs and support the seat of the new dining chair. `` This is the fun part about designing by the seat of your pants,'' he said. `` You think you know where you're going, but you do n't. `` If you look at it, you're looking at the bone and sinew and all the rest of the mass is subtracted. I get more of a feel for what makes that baby work.'' <PERSON> Livingston </PERSON> was intrigued by a suggestion some time back to make the chairs out of injection-molded plastic. `` The way I work with the material, I tend to make the wood into a plastic material,'' he said. `` You look at a tree limb sticking out from the trunk, and if that is n't a plastic process, I do n't know what is Wood is basically a bunch of bendable fibers. `` It would be easier to pour the stuff into an injection mold and spit out one of these chairs every two hours in any color you want and walk laughing to the bank.'' Though it takes 40 hours to whittle one of his dining chairs out of wood, <PERSON> Livingston </PERSON> finds it more friendly than plastic. `` It has an inherent warmth about it that's hard to duplicate in plastic,'' he said. `` Even a warm color in plastic is cold. Whereas wood, you want to touch wood, feel it.''

<TEXT>
 The words like ethereal, despairing, melancholy and dolorous that mark reviews of the <ORGANIZATION> Cowboy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Junkies </ORGANIZATION> tip off right away that this is not your average pop group. So, learning that vocalist <PERSON> Margo </PERSON> <PERSON> Timmins </PERSON>' apartment on one of <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION>'s trendiest streets is unmarked and hidden away behind some offices should not come as a surprise. `` That's the way I like it,'' she says with a bit of a grimace when told the address for the scheduled interview was hard to find. The publicity machine of the pop music industry is gearing up to promote one of its unlikeliest recent hits, the <ORGANIZATION> Cowboy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Junkies </ORGANIZATION>' `` The Trinity Session'' recorded in one day in November 1987 at the Church of the Holy Trinity in <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION> The album, whose production cost was $ 250, includes eerily stretched out, sparse versions of <PERSON> Hank </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>' `` I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry,'' <PERSON> Lou </PERSON> <PERSON> Reed </PERSON>'s `` Sweet Jane'' and <PERSON> Patsy </PERSON> <PERSON> Cline </PERSON>'s `` Walking After Midnight.'' Some haunting originals are included as well, such as `` Misguided Angel'' and `` 200 More Miles.'' `` In the last two months I've done more interviews than most people do in a lifetime,'' the 28-year-old <PERSON> Timmins </PERSON> said, taking a break from packing for a long tour that includes a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> stop to perform on `` Saturday Night Live.'' `` It's just a matter of getting used to it,'' she said, with a laugh. `` It's like everything ... everything's happened so quickly.'' Her 29-year-old brother, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON>, and his childhood friend <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Anton </PERSON> came back to <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION> after stints performing to little acclaim for a few years in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>. They started rehearsing in the garage of <PERSON> Timmins </PERSON>' younger brother, <PERSON> Pete </PERSON>, then brought him into the band to play drums. <PERSON> Margo </PERSON> joined to do vocals. But not only did n't she see herself as a singer, she also was concerned that a band with too many family relationships could cause strains. `` It's worked out really well. <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> and I really work well together,'' she said. Settled in for a conversation with <PERSON> EmmyLou </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>' new record playing in the background, she said, `` It's an honor for me to sing his songs.'' The band has been together since 1985 but publicity swelled last year after RCA released `` The Trinity Session'' in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and enthusiastic reviews started appearing. The music generally is pegged as country-blues with a touch of the Velvet Underground. The <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>' critics poll found it the best pop album of 1988, beating out U2, <PERSON> Tracy </PERSON> <PERSON> Chapman </PERSON> and <PERSON> Prince </PERSON>. Times' critic <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Hilburn </PERSON> called them `` mesmerizing.'' <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Timmins </PERSON> phones to check if the interview is running smoothly or if an explanation of how the <ORGANIZATION> Cowboy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Junkies </ORGANIZATION> picked their name is needed, but <PERSON> Margo </PERSON> tells him it's already been discussed. She said the name was chosen because an independent band, especially in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> with its smaller market, needs anything it can get to attract attention. `` I think it did us well at that level,'' she said. `` It's still generating a lot of interest.'' With the addition of three sidemen, the band has swelled to seven. There's been some local sniping about the <ORGANIZATION> Cowboy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Junkies </ORGANIZATION>' success outside of <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, where record companies generally have limited slots that go to bands aimed squarely at the mainstream. `` Yes, I think that's really unfortunate that you have to go across the border to get recognized, but you have to be realistic,'' said <PERSON> Timmins </PERSON>, her shock of light hair pulled back. `` I am in the American market. It's the facts of life _ but no one's going to get me to say that I'm an American band. `` Whatever makes us Canadian is in our music. I do n't think we're flag raisers We're much more laid back.'' She also has limited patience for those who criticize their music. `` If you like it, fine. If you do n't _ do n't listen,'' she said. `` I ca n't really put my finger on what we're doing. It surprises us; a lot of it is spontaneous.'' The slow pacing of the music and the band's quiet demeanor during performances can take some getting used to. `` It's definitely on some weird edge and there's the danger of falling off at some point,'' <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> said in an interview with the Canadian Press news agency. `` We've never attempted to be a country band or a rock band. We just play and this melancholy sound comes out.'' `` We've just found when we slow a song down it starts to make more sense,'' <PERSON> Margo </PERSON> said. `` It leaves us much more room for interpretation.'' `` It's a big challenge to play slow. You're asking a lot of the audience,'' she said. `` There's also the risk that when it does n't work, it's dull And I'm not ashamed to admit it.'' The decision to record in a church was made for the sound, and <PERSON> Timmins </PERSON> noted that the `` The Trinity Session'' was centered consciously around the vocals. `` We knew that the church would bring out the best of my voice,'' she said, laughing. `` Singing in a church does a lot for your vocals.'' The next album will also be recorded live over a period of time in different locations. `` When you record live, the room is an acoustical instrument,'' she said.

<HEAD>Nashville Sound: Floyd Cramer Learned Well</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOE EDWARDS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 As a youngster, aspiring musician <PERSON> Floyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Cramer </PERSON> would agitate his piano teachers by playing `` by ear'' rather than learning to read music. Despite their protests, <PERSON> Cramer </PERSON> became the best piano player in the small sawmill town of <LOCATION> Huttig </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ark </LOCATION>. In fact, he went on to become one of the most famous in the world. In a career spanning more than 30 years, he played on many of <PERSON> Elvis </PERSON> <PERSON> Presley </PERSON>'s records and movie soundtracks. His million-selling hit `` Last Date'' became a piano standard. He even developed a piano technique often referred to as the `` slip note'' style. Today, he's seen often in TV ads, selling such albums as `` World Famous Love Songs'' and `` Treasury of Favorites.'' He's sold more than a million copies through TV marketing alone in the past three years. Prior to making records for sale by television, he spent 23 years with <ORGANIZATION> RCA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Records </ORGANIZATION> and joined guitarist <PERSON> Chet </PERSON> <PERSON> Atkins </PERSON> and sax player <PERSON> Boots </PERSON> <PERSON> Randolph </PERSON> as <LOCATION> Nashville </LOCATION>'s best-known instrumentalists. He's recorded more than 50 albums All this came from a bashful kid who disliked practicing, exasperated his teachers and still admits that classical music is beyond his limits. He still does n't like to practice. He even avoids the term, preferring to call it `` playing'': `` Some call it practice. I call it play. That's because I enjoy it; practice I do n't enjoy.'' Regardless of what he calls it, <PERSON> Cramer </PERSON> has been stroking the ivories since his parents bought a spinet piano when he was 5. `` I had some lessons, but I just was n't interested,'' the 55-year-old musician recalled. `` It was the confinement, I guess. But I enjoyed playing by ear. The teachers got upset because I learned it by ear.'' By age 15 he was playing and traveling with country music stars such as <PERSON> Webb </PERSON> <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> and <PERSON> Faron </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON>. In his early 20s, he was playing piano on a flatbed truck and in school auditoriums on a tour of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> featuring a young singer named <PERSON> Elvis </PERSON> <PERSON> Presley </PERSON>. <PERSON> Cramer </PERSON> later played on most of Presley's records and in his movies including `` Blue <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>,'' `` Girl Happy'' and `` Roustabout.'' `` He was always nice to us,'' <PERSON> Cramer </PERSON> said about the recording sessions. `` He enjoyed the musicians and felt very comfortable.'' <PERSON> Cramer </PERSON> has 6 - and 9-year-old granddaughters who have become Presley fans His `` Last Date'' in 1960 is still heard on radio stations playing `` golden oldies,'' and the tune has been learned by thousands of young piano students who were n't even born when <PERSON> Cramer </PERSON> wrote and recorded it. `` It's a simple melody,'' he said. `` It's good exercise for both hands. You are playing solid left hand patterns and a dominant melody with the right hand. It's different and fresh to most piano students.'' The song has found its way into American ceremonies, also. `` I've had people tell me they'd like to have it played at their funeral,'' <PERSON> Cramer </PERSON> said. `` And others say they'd like to have it played at their wedding. About two weeks ago, someone said it was played at the altar call at church. So it means different things to different people.'' In 1984, at the request of <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, <PERSON> Cramer </PERSON> played piano at a birthday party for <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s mother because he is her favorite musical performer. <PERSON> Cramer </PERSON> quoted the young rock superstar as saying he'd been listening to `` Last Date'' all his life and that <PERSON> Cramer </PERSON>'s music had influenced his style. `` The song has been very good to me; I'm proud of it; I play it every chance I get,'' <PERSON> Cramer </PERSON> said. His style of playing is slurring, or bending, notes. It's sort of a near-miss on the keyboard. `` They call it everything,'' he said. `` Some call it a mistake with a quick recovery.'' He describes his own gift as `` being able to play with feeling, to interpret a mood of a song.'' But he acknowledges some shortcomings. `` I'm not good at classical. Some I would n't dare try because it's beyond me. Some would say it's beyond my capabilities, technique or training or my mind of comprehension. But I know my limits, that's the key.'' Nevertheless, he still learns just about every time he sits down at one of the three pianos he owns. `` I learn something all the time: a different way to play certain things. Different songs and melodies contribute to that.'' Does he sing? `` Just for my own amusement,'' he said.

<HEAD>Scientists Study Way to Pinpoint Pollution Sources in Acid Rain</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GAITHERSBURG, Md. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Scientists are studying a way to `` tag'' smokestack pollutants much the way biologists tag birds and animals as part of research into pinpointing the chemicals that contribute to acid rain. In tests begun last summer, <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Standards </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Maryland </ORGANIZATION> aerosol chemist <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Ondov </PERSON> injected an enriched, or strengthened, isotope of the metal neodymium into smoke from a coal-burning power plant in northern <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>. Analysis showed that air filters at sampling sites in an arc from <LOCATION> Bethesda </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Landover </LOCATION> `` detected the release of the enriched isotope 20 kilometers from the power plant,'' <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> said. The experiment proved `` we can inject it into the smokestack, take samples into the lab and detect the effect.'' <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> and Ondov are seeking an <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> grant to study whether the particle tracing will work over longer distances. The <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> is testing isotope tracers in diesel fuel used by public vehicles in <LOCATION> Roanoke </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>. Plants could be injected with different isotopes to help track the pollutants each one produces Imagine each isotope is a colored ping pong ball, <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> said. `` You can count the relative numbers of blue, green and red balls, and say, ` Aha! The plant in Town A, even though it is further away, is the source of 10 times the number of balls as the plant right next door.''' Acid rain is formed from sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide released by the combustion of coal and other fossil fuels. In combination with water, they form nitric acid gas and sulfuric acid droplets, which dissolve in rain.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nuclear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> hopes to start testing the durability of military equipment by 1994 in a $ 74 million device that will simulate the heat and shock waves of a nuclear blast. The blast simulator will consist of a 894-foot-long tube, 66 feet in diameter, connected to a test chamber big enough to hold a tank or helicopter, said spokeswoman <PERSON> Cheri </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdelnour </PERSON>. The other end of the tube will be fitted with nine high-pressure valves that will create a shock wave of compressed nitrogen; torches burning oxygen and aluminum powder will create short blasts of heat. The device will be able to bombard objects with energy as strong as 600 kiloton blasts _ 30 times the power of the bomb that devastated <LOCATION> Hiroshima </LOCATION>. Construction could start in two years, at a site on the northwest corner of the missile range chosen after a year-long study, <PERSON> Abdelnour </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Archaeologist Disputes Popular View of Mammoth Hunts</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CASPER, Wyo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 An archaeologist who went to <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> to test stone tools used 11,000 years ago in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> says modern painting of mammoth hunts are based largely on misconceptions about the hunters' abilities. Paintings, dioramas and even textbooks often show mammoths up to their tusks in swamps with hunters rushing around, waving spears and yelling, said <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Frison </PERSON>, `` and usually somebody being trampled to death.'' This almost certainly was not the typical hunting method of Clovis cultures that lived in the <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> area, said the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wyoming </ORGANIZATION> professor. The short spears and lances found at Clovis-period sites could be used to kill and skin mammoths, <PERSON> Frison </PERSON> said, but the hunters probably went after young, stray animals to avoid facing charging herds of the 15,000-pound creatures. Assuming that mammoths had a social structure similar to African elephants, a Clovis-culture hunt would probably proceed very differently. Elephants have a strong family structure in which the matriarch is protector of the herd. At the sign of danger, the matriarch will charge, six or more tons of enraged elephant bearing down on the hunter, armed only with a stone-tipped spear. `` You're not going to down a charging matriarch with Clovis weaponry,'' <PERSON> Frison </PERSON> said Consequently, the only way Clovis hunters could routinely have killed mammoths would be by going after younger animals away from the herd. Hunters would have worked in pairs, one distracting the animal without threatening it, and the other sneaking up on it to deliver the fatal wound, he said. They would then hide until the animal died and the herd left. <PERSON> Frison </PERSON>, testing his theories on dead elephants in <LOCATION> Zimbabwe </LOCATION>, found that <PERSON> Clovis </PERSON> spears and lances could pierce an elephant's hide from 60 feet. A spear that pierced a mammoth's lungs would probably kill it within minutes, while one that pierced the stomach would take hours to days to cause death, he said. <PERSON> Frison </PERSON> said no one can really know the Clovis techniques but that this is more likely than the screaming tribal charge often depicted by artists. `` Clovis really represents the development of true hunting weaponry,'' <PERSON> Frison </PERSON> said, a conclusion he admits is controversial among those who studied early humans in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>. `` If you're really talking about the kind of hunting that one or two hunters bring down a mammoth,'' he said, `` it developed in the new world.''

<HEAD>Director Wants To Phase Out Leper Colony</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALAN SAYRE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CARVILLE, La. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Leprosy treatment has come a long way since the days when victims of the disfiguring disease were forcibly detained here. <PERSON> Hansen </PERSON>'s Disease can be treated almost exclusively on an outpatient basis now, and the director of the only leper colony in the continental <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> plans to phase out the antiquated facility set up when victims were outcasts. But Dr. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Duffy </PERSON> does n't intend for the work of the <PERSON> Gillis </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Long </PERSON> <PERSON> Hansen </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> to be lost as its buildings age along with its 140 permanent patients, who average 65 years old. One outgrowth of leprosy research has led to help for diabetics, for example. `` Our research is outstanding, but our physical plant is a disaster,'' said <PERSON> Duffy </PERSON>, citing an <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> study. He wants to move the center's acute care, research and education functions, to <LOCATION> Baton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rouge </LOCATION>. The colony was opened in 1894 on an old plantation when the state ferried five men and two women up the <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> under cover of night from a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> `` pest house.'' The federal government took control in 1921 and as many as 500 permanent residents were housed during the 1930s. Most of the 330-acre complex of white, plantation-style buildings connected by a maze of enclosed walkways was built during the'30s by the <ORGANIZATION> Works </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Progress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>. `` It was a very different patient population,'' <PERSON> Duffy </PERSON> said. `` They were young, non-immigrant and they were mainstream Americans.'' Leprosy victims were arrested and forcibly detained here until after World War II, when drugs were found that stopped the contagiousness and progression of the disease. Over time, fewer patients took up permanent residence. The center, which has treated nearly 3,000 patients, survived when the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration in 1984 closed seven other hospitals operated by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. The late <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON> Gillis </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Long </PERSON> spearheaded a drive to save it, but federal officials suggested research be done by either the <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> or the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institutes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION>. Leprosy, a bacterial infection, attacks the skin, flesh and nerves, and is characterized by scabs, deformities and eventual loss of sensation. There are an estimated 6,000 to 10,000 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> cases, but up to 20 million worldwide. `` We will continue to receive men, women and children with this disease. It's not an excludable disease,'' <PERSON> Duffy </PERSON> said. `` You can have it and you can come into this country. Because the incubation period is sometimes six to eight years somebody can come into this country with no idea they have the disease.'' Research needs to continue at the center, he said. For one thing, the work takes hundreds of armadillos, the only nonhuman animal that gets the disease, and `` there is no room at either <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> or NIH for the armadillos.'' Also, `` All the experts are here. They are not in <LOCATION> Bethesda </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>.'' The center could take rental space in <LOCATION> Baton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rouge </LOCATION> without increasing its $ 18 million annual budget, he said. All major advances in leprosy treatment _ drugs, armadillo-related discoveries and two generations of vaccines with limited effectiveness _ came from <PERSON> Carville </PERSON>'s researchers, said <PERSON> Duffy </PERSON>, who fears that research would be downgraded if it was moved to another agency. `` It's one of the paradoxes of the disease that as far as scientists are concerned, their interest is almost always elsewhere than on this disease,'' he said. `` It's not the kind of research for which you will win a Nobel Prize. `` As a result, the scientific community has paid scant or little attention to this disease. There is this group that has almost, in a sense, religiously dedicated their lives to this disease, that are centered here.'' But even the worst cases discovered today can be handled through one of 11 regional treatment centers or by private doctors. For example, a victim whose disease progressed while he was confined in a <LOCATION> Cambodian </LOCATION> prison is undergoing outpatient treatment in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. Thalidomide, notorious for causing congenital birth defects, is one drug that controls the disease. The drug of choice is diaminodiphenyl sulfone, first used in leprosy treatment in 1941 by Dr. <PERSON> Guy </PERSON> <PERSON> Faget </PERSON> at <LOCATION> Carville </LOCATION>. Two other drugs _ Rifampin and <LOCATION> Clofazamins </LOCATION> _ have been tested successfully in recent years, and research continues because the bacteria is becoming resistant to sulfone drugs. New admissions to <PERSON> Carville </PERSON> are mostly patients with reactions to the drug treatment or have diagnostic problems. After a few weeks, they go home. Research into the loss of feeling in hands and now is being put to work for diabetics, who often require amputations after foot injuries stemming from the lack of sensation in their extremities. About 500 diabetics have been treated here for foot problems such as ulcers with special casts that allow healing and mobility, said Dr. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Patout </PERSON>, chief of rehabilitation. `` The techniques we've developed here could reduce the number of amputations among diabetics, about 50,000 a year, by 90 percent. Of the diabetics treated at <ORGANIZATION> Carville </ORGANIZATION>, only two have undergone amputations. <PERSON> Duffy </PERSON> would like to see more diabetics take advantage of <PERSON> Carville </PERSON>, but he admits the stigma of leprosy may keep many patients from coming to the center. That is another reason to move treatment facilities to <LOCATION> Baton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rouge </LOCATION>. As far as the permanent colony residents are concerned, the federal government should continue to care for them at <ORGANIZATION> Carville </ORGANIZATION>, he said, especially because of the traditional stigma. `` Private nursing homes would n't take them. What I would like to do is leave that population right here and provide them all the resources of a long-term care facility.''

Effect Of Coma On Pregnant Women, Fetuses</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NICHOLAS K. GERANIOS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>YAKIMA, Wash. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Blodgett </PERSON> was in a coma when she gave birth to a healthy eight-pound son in December. <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Klein </PERSON> remains in a coma after her husband won the right to abort her 18-week-old fetus earlier this month. The number of pregnant women who go into a coma each year is small, doctors say, and many questions remain about how a pregnant woman's coma affects the fetus and how a fetus affects the recovery of its comatose mother. That's why <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Blodgett </PERSON>'s birth was so unique _ and why <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Klein </PERSON> fought for an abortion, hoping to improve his wife's chances of recovery There are no accurate statistics, but three large <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trauma centers report a total of about 20 cases of pregnant women in comas over two years. Doctors at all three hospitals agreed that in most cases the coma ends and the woman goes home and has a healthy baby. With severe head injuries most fetuses abort naturally, are aborted to help the mother, or die in childbirth. `` There is a very high incidence of spontaneous abortion that occurs in these cases,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Case </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Western </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, and director of neurosurgery at <ORGANIZATION> Metropolitan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION>, one of the largest trauma centers. `` Out of this group they either spontaneously abort or after a few weeks they go home to deliver.'' In perhaps one comatose patient a year is a birth even attempted, and <PERSON> White </PERSON> said he could not remember such a birth ever being successful at the hospital. The mother often begins to `` unravel medically,'' forcing doctors to try for a premature birth, he said. `` There is not a lot of research in this.'' Doctors at <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> said <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> <PERSON> Blodget </PERSON>'s birth was only the fourth successful delivery from a comatose mother they could document in medical history Dr. <PERSON> Madhura </PERSON> <PERSON> Patel </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Baylor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medicine </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>, who specializes in treating head injuries to pregnant women, has seen only seven such cases in two years. Several patients recovered with fetuses intact but in one case of an unmarried teen-ager who was five weeks pregnant, the girl's father ordered an abortion his daughter was unlikely ever to be able to care for an infant. `` The mother subsequently woke up from the coma but continues to be impaired. She has no memory of the fact of ever being pregnant.'' <PERSON> Blodgett </PERSON>, 24, of <LOCATION> Yakima </LOCATION>, suffered brain stem injury in a traffic accident June 30, when she was three months pregnant. After initial reluctance, family members say, a <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> hospital accepted her. Doctors held out little hope of improvement, but shortly after <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>'s Dec. 9 birth, <PERSON> Blodgett </PERSON> began regaining consciousness and was well enough to return home in mid-January. She has made steady progress and has limited use of one arm, allowing her to cradle her newborn and point to letters to spell words. Last week she began intensive rehabilitation at <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elizabeth </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Yakima </LOCATION>, and, in a unique challenge, has vowed to walk and talk before her newborn. No one knows exactly why <PERSON> Blodgett </PERSON> came around after the birth, although one doctor speculated that hormonal changes triggered a return to consciousness. Family members feel she was conserving her energy for the fetus. `` After she had the baby, it was a signal for her to go,'' husband <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Blodgett </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> said. `` After she had the baby she concentrated more on herself.'' The family `` never had a lot of hope from any doctor,'' <PERSON> Blodgett </PERSON> said, but always had faith she would recover. `` We spent so much time with her that you could see the small things she did.'' <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Klein </PERSON> had no such hopes. He successfully battled anti-abortion activists to win a court order allowing the abortion, which doctors said could aid his wife's recovery. Mrs. <PERSON> Klein </PERSON>, 32, remains in a coma at <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shore </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> on <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>

 When most people think of blimps, they imagine gently floating giant balloons advertising everything from tires to film to soft drinks. The <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> has another picture: protector of warships, able to remain nearly invisible to radar while providing early warning of approaching enemy aircraft. Blimps played this role in World War II but the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> abandoned its airships as outdated in the early 1960s. Now, the Pentagon has ordered construction of a 425-foot-long blimp that will be the largest non-rigid airship ever built, more than twice as long as a conventional blimp. The blimp will be equipped with powerful radar and will be capable of patrolling for several days without refueling. It will fly as high as 10,000 feet at speeds up to 80 knots, about 92 miles per hour. `` Everyone has been doing these paper studies of the airships for, I do n't know, ever since they stopped using airships,'' said <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Hochstetler </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Airship </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION>, a British blimp maker that is building the military blimp in a joint venture with <ORGANIZATION> Westinghouse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> `` The only way anyone will really be able to say whether or not a wide, modern-technology airship would have benefits in the modern <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> is to actually have one that size that you go up and fly on and try out your ideas with. `` So many of the ideas are predicated on installing equipment that never existed before in the old airship days,' <PERSON> Hochstetler </PERSON> said. `` We've all kind of new technologies that conceivably can make them much more usable.'' <ORGANIZATION> Airship </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> sees a new generation of blimps being used not just for military surveillance, but for spotting drug-smuggling planes, monitoring ocean pollution and taking tourists on sightseeing flights. `` Surveillance is certainly one that they are pushing very hard. It's a machine that's very good at that job. It's good at advertising. It's very good at people going for a ride to see the scenery,'' said Capt. <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON>, manager of Airship's facility here `` To get from A to B, no, it's not the machine for it.'' <ORGANIZATION> Airship </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION>, the world's largest manufacturer of blimps, has built 13 since it was formed about eight years ago, said <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Dickson </PERSON>, assistant marketing manager in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Among them are two blimps sold to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> for police surveillance. The $ 168 million prototype of the military blimp should be ready to fly by 1993, <PERSON> Hochstetler </PERSON> said. A model of its three-deck gondola is under construction in a former <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> blimp hangar built during World War II outside <LOCATION> Elizabeth </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. The compartment underneath the blimp will contain sleeping berths for a crew of 12 to 15, an exercise room, refueling gear and other equipment. The blimp will be able to move up or down, forward or backward, with the help of computerized flight controls and vectored-thrust engines equipped with propellers that can be swiveled to any up or down angle. The blimp's plastic-lined fabric hull will be filled with helium, which is non-flammable. The rigid dirigibles of the 1930s, like the ill-fated <PERSON> Hindenburg </PERSON>, were filled with explosive hydrogen. If the blimp is fired upon, it would remain afloat because it has low internal pressure and the gas would escape slowly. Even with a severe helium loss, the blimp would slowly descend rather than crash, <ORGANIZATION> Airship </ORGANIZATION> said. Airship officials believe blimps' potential has barely been explored, and say that the prototype should lead to other military and commercial uses. `` The airship can do things no other aircraft can,'' <PERSON> Hochstetler </PERSON> said. `` We've just scratched the surface.''

<HEAD>Director Wants To Phase Out Leper Colony</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Leprosy treatment has come a long way since the days when victims of the disfiguring disease were forcibly detained here. <PERSON> Hansen </PERSON>'s Disease can be treated almost exclusively on an outpatient basis now, and the director of the only leper colony in the continental <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> plans to phase out the antiquated facility set up when victims were outcasts. But Dr. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Duffy </PERSON> does n't intend for the work of the <PERSON> Gillis </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Long </PERSON> <PERSON> Hansen </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> to be lost as its buildings age along with its 140 permanent patients, who average 65 years old. One outgrowth of leprosy research has led to help for diabetics, for example. `` Our research is outstanding, but our physical plant is a disaster,'' said <PERSON> Duffy </PERSON>, citing an <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> study. He wants to move the center's acute care, research and education functions, to <LOCATION> Baton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rouge </LOCATION>. The center, which has treated nearly 3,000 patients, survived when the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration in 1984 closed seven other hospitals operated by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. The late <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON> Gillis </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Long </PERSON> spearheaded a drive to save it, but federal officials suggested research be done by either the <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> or the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institutes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION>. Research needs to continue at the center, <PERSON> Duffy </PERSON> said. `` All the experts are here. They are not in <LOCATION> Bethesda </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>.'' Leprosy, a bacterial infection, attacks the skin, flesh and nerves, and is characterized by scabs, deformities and eventual loss of sensation. There are an estimated 6,000 to 10,000 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> cases, but up to 20 million worldwide. All major advances in leprosy treatment came at <LOCATION> Carville </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Duffy </PERSON>, who fears that research would be downgraded if it was moved to another agency. Research into the loss of feeling in hands and feet now is being put to work for diabetics, who often require amputations after foot injuries stemming from the lack of sensation in their extremities.

<HEAD>Little Known About Effect Of Coma On Pregnant Women, Fetuses</HEAD>
<DATELINE>YAKIMA, Wash. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Blodgett </PERSON> was in a coma when she gave birth to a healthy eight-pound son in December. <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Klein </PERSON> remains in a coma after her husband won the right to abort her 18-week-old fetus earlier this month. The number of pregnant women who go into a coma each year is small, doctors say, and many questions remain about how a pregnant woman's coma affects the fetus and how a fetus affects the recovery of its comatose mother. That's why <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Blodgett </PERSON>'s birth was so unique _ and why <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Klein </PERSON> fought for an abortion, hoping to improve his wife's chances of recovery There are no accurate statistics, but three large <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trauma centers report a total of about 20 cases of pregnant women in comas over two years. Doctors at all three hospitals agreed that in most cases the coma ends and the woman goes home and has a healthy baby. With severe head injuries most fetuses abort naturally, are aborted to help the mother, or die in childbirth. <PERSON> Blodgett </PERSON>, 24, of <LOCATION> Yakima </LOCATION>, suffered brain stem injury in a traffic accident June 30, when she was three months pregnant. Doctors held out little hope of improvement, but shortly after <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>'s Dec. 9 birth, <PERSON> Blodgett </PERSON> began regaining consciousness and was well enough to return home in mid-January. She has made steady progress and has limited use of one arm, allowing her to cradle her newborn and point to letters to spell words. Last week she began intensive rehabilitation at <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elizabeth </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Yakima </LOCATION>, and, in a unique challenge, has vowed to walk and talk before her newborn. No one knows exactly why <PERSON> Blodgett </PERSON> came around after the birth, although one doctor speculated that hormonal changes triggered a return to consciousness. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Klein </PERSON> successfully battled anti-abortion activists to win a court order allowing the abortion, which doctors said could aid his wife's recovery. Mrs. <PERSON> Klein </PERSON>, 32, remains in a coma at <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shore </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> on <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>.

 Would black strawberries on your shortcake whet your appetite? How about some blue sweet corn? And would <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Piper </PERSON> pick a peck of purple peppers? These colored vegetables and others are available or in the process of being developed. Would they lure you to the market, at least to try some? The `` Black Beauty'' strawberry _ known thus far as NY1593 _ is an advanced selection of strawberry characterized by a deep purplish-red color that is almost black. `` I hesitate to recommend it as a table variety because I do n't think people are ready to accept strawberries that are n't red,'' says <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanford </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Cornell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> State Agricultural Experiment Station in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, who is working on the berry He believes the berry may be valuable as a natural coloring agent for processed foods, ice cream, yogurt and frozen fruit bars. The black berry is large, attractive, relatively firm and has a pleasant flavor, says <PERSON> Sanford </PERSON>, who ranked it about the same in nutritional value as the traditional red berry. Blue corn wo n't turn your teeth blue, as some folks might fear, says <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Albuquerque </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.M. </LOCATION>, who founded <ORGANIZATION> Blue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Connection </ORGANIZATION> in 1985. He produces blue corn popcorn, pancake, muffin and waffle mixes, blue corn cnips and blue corn meal ground coarse, medium and fine. <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> says people are intrigued by a blue product and `` most of our products come across a little sweeter.'' He says about 15,000 acres of blue corn are being farmed presently, largely in the <ORGANIZATION> Southwest </ORGANIZATION>. There are quite a few purple vegetables. Purple cabbages alternated with green ones in the garden are attractive. There are glossy purple eggplants named Black Magic. Purple cauliflower actually looks more like broccoli but with smaller buds. Varieties include Purple-Head and Royal Purple. Purple cauliflowers generally become green when cooked. Seed companies also are offering blue potatoes, white eggplant, yellow beets and burgundy beans. Scalloped, or patty-pan squash, normally seen in white or pale green, is now available in a dark green variety called `` Scallopini.'' One potato variety named `` All Blue,'' has both blue skin and blue flesh, while `` Blue Victor'' has blue skin and white flesh. Blue spud plants generally produce less than more traditional varieties and size is likely to be smaller. White eggplant may be smaller than the regular purple varietles and as they mature they may turn yellow. The flavor also may be stronger. And there are golden beets that can be used for the same dishes as red beets without bleeding their color into surrounding vegetables. Some traditionally green and yellow vegetables have gone to red and yellow, including green beans with purple pods named `` Royal Burgundy,'' a purple cauliflower named `` Royal Purple,'' and an okra with deep red pods, simply called red okra. The color changes to dark green upon cooking. Red cabbages and red lettuce add color to your garden. Among them are `` Ruby Ball'' and `` Red Acre'' cabbage and `` Red Salad Bowl'' and `` Ruby'' lettuce. <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Rothenberger </PERSON>, horticulture specialist at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Missouri </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cooperative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Extension </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, has said that `` gardeners often want flowers, fruits and vegetables in colors other than those natural to the plant. In nature, as well as by the manipulation of breeders, unusual colors sometimes appear _ although relatively rarely. Some of them can be reproduced and made available for garden use while others are short-lived and may never be seen again. `` For the vegetable garden,'' he said, `` you may find white pumpkins, green cantaloupes, red brussels sprouts, striped beets, blue potatoes, yellow radishes, white acorn squash, and even yellow strawberries. <PERSON> Rothenberger </PERSON> said a red brussels sprout has been introduced from <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. Named Rubine, it maintains its red coloring during cooking. Acorn squash also may be found in yellow, as well as dark green. `` For the gardener, as well as on the plate,'' <PERSON> Rothenberger </PERSON> said, `` unusual colors add interest, novelty and perhaps new tastes.'' <ORGANIZATION> Cornell </ORGANIZATION> researchers also reported that the traditional white heads of cauliflower may be challenged by an orange-colored cousin, a head that looks and tastes like the white variety, one that `` seemingly has a cheese sauce bred into it, has a longer shelf-life and is very nutritious.'' A big question marketers will face is the saleability of the unusally colored cauliflower, so a curious <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dickson </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Cornell </ORGANIZATION> took 100 heads of orange cauliflower to a popular <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>, N.Y.-area farm market. `` I think this is a winner,'' said <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Nicholson </PERSON>, who operates Red Jacket Orchards. `` I believe there is a ready acceptance for this color because it is novel and because it looks as if it's been drenched with cheese sauce.'' He said the test supply sold readily, as did a second 100 provided by <PERSON> Dickson </PERSON>. <PERSON> Dickson </PERSON> said the orange cauliflower, identified only by number now, `` promises to be something more than just a number once a nutrition-minded public discovers its benefits.''

<TEXT>
 Who says the only good bug is a dead bug? One of the best bugs to have in your garden is the ladybug. Each day, it feeds on many `` bad'' insects, such as aphids, <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> potato beetles, grape rootworms, alfalfa weevils, plus others. This helps keep things in natural balance. The black-spotted red ladybird, better known as ladybug, is a voracious, predatory beetle described as one the most beneficial on earth. Millions of them have been released on croplands, their hearty appetites helping to reduce aphid populations _ with biological pest control. <ORGANIZATION> Cornell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> scientists note the advantages of biological controls: There is no environmental damage; the pests do not develop resistance to their predators as they do to chemicals, and a small initial investment results in a safe, permanent control method. In <LOCATION> Palo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Alto </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, some years ago, park officials released 300,000 ladybugs to fight plant pests. Gardeners in <LOCATION> Albuquerque </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.M. </LOCATION>, scattered more than 2.5 mlllion ladybugs to protect plants. In <LOCATION> Medford </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ore. </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Perkins </PERSON> invited thousands of ladybugs to an aphid feast in their rose test garden. <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Geographic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> magazine </ORGANIZATION> has reported 4,300 known species of ladybugs, or which <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> has 370. Remember tne children's chant: `` Ladybug, ladybug, fly away home, your house is on fire, your children will burn. This was a plea by English farmers concerned for the safety of ladybugs during the annual burning of hop fields. Given a chance, an adult egg-laying ladybug may consume up to 200 aphids a day. One larva may eat between 200 and 300 during its development. National Geographic noted that ladybugs were put to work by man in the late 1800s when a species, <PERSON> Rodolia </PERSON> cardinalis, was imported into <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> to combat the cottony cushion scale insect, saving the citrus industry in two years at a cost of only $ 1,500. Ladybugs are sold by the pint, quart and gallon; a half-pint means about 4,000 ladybugs. A major concern is in getting the tiny migratory insects not to fly away home. <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> studies indicate that 90 percent wing off after release. Since they do n't fly at night, a late afternoon or early evening release will encourage at least an overnight stay. The beetles are very mobile. When there only a few aphids around, a <ORGANIZATION> Cornell </ORGANIZATION> researcher reported, they migrate, searching for other areas of food, scouting apple crops, oats, winter wheat, sugar beets and beans. The researchers imported the predacious European seven-spotted lady beetle to help protect potato and alfalfa fields. There is no correlation between the number of spots and the beetle's age. The number of spots on a beetle's back is characteristic of its species, not its age. Ladybugs are but one example of millions of harmless insects, <ORGANIZATION> Cornell </ORGANIZATION> noted. In fact, fewer than 2 percent of all insects are pests and those are `` often controlled by natural enemies.'' The researchers recommend that gardeners and homeowners be certain that insects are actually doing damage before they take action. Insects belong in a garden. They are natural and often harmless, if not beneficial. Spray only if you detect damage. Beneficial insects such as ladybugs ot all kinds and green lacewings should be protected, entomologists say. By learning to identify their eggs and larvae, we may save time, money, energy and the environment. Many ladybugs have been released in recent years to devour aphids feeding on upstate <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> alfalfa, peaches and potatoes. If you see an unattractive, dark insect with orange, blue and black patches and a deeply segmented body covered with spines, do n't squash it It may be an immatore lady beetle, hungry and looking for a meal. One catalog -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Burpee </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- offers a half-pint for $ 9.95, a quart for $ 17.95, recommending they be released in small batches.

 If summer brings a lull to your gardening activity, perhaps you'll have time to build a rock garden. Select a location that has at least a half-day of sun _ more is better if you want to make a show of flowering plants. A steep slope or the vicinity of a rock outcrop is good. Not everyone has such a location, however, and we suggest you avoid making a round pile in the middle of a lawn. Instead, place the rock garden in a corner, off to the side, next to a foundation or bordering steps. If the area is level, change the grade. Shovel out the soil a foot to 18 inches and slope it, perhaps, making two hills with a valley between. Then put in a 6-inch layer of stones or gravel for drainage. On this foundation replace the soil, mixing in sand or gravel to improve drainage. Add some peat. Then develop the contour, with the lowest or largest stones embedded to make them look as though they have always been there. Then add your next layer with the spaces between filled with the mixture or medium for the plants to grow in. We suggest you place rocks horizontally and in a line so that they appear to be part of a bed or layer. Avoid `` dragon's teeth,'' or pointed sharp rocks standing up. We prefer one kind of stone, not a collection, and mica-infested rocks are quite gaudy. Continue building to a reasonable height, then place a few stones to tie in the main groupings in the garden. You can move them around until you get the right effect, then imbed the rocks into the soil. Finally, place your plants. A narrow hand trowel is handy to dig between the rocks. Select low, creeping plants, not border flowers. Consider alyssum, aubrietas, low pinks, armerias, creeping phlox, miniature iris or other miniatures, spring and fall crocus, snowdrops and other low-growing varieties. You do n't have to feed often. Water when necessary and weed or loosen soil if necessary.

 The primary use of houseplant containers is to hold the soil for plants to grow in, but they have a major influence on plant growth because they affect a plant's water supply. The size and porosity of plant containers and the presence or absence of drainage holes in the bottom are critical factors, says <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> State University Extension horticulture specialist. The relative sizes of the pot and the plant it holds affect both the plant's water and nutrient supplies. <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> says that `` a plant that's too large for its pot dries out quickly. A plant in an oversized pot may suffer from too much water because, after watering, the soil stays saturated for a long time. Also, the nutrients in the soil may be leached out before the plant has a chance to use them.'' The container's porosity affects the plant's water supply by influencing how quickly the soil dries out after watering. Householders who tend to overwater plants should avoid glazed, glass or plastic containers because they keep water from moving out of the soil and air from moving in. On the other hand, porous clay pots permit air to move into the soil and water to escape. This is important because plant roots need air as well as water to function. Roots that stay a long time in water-logged soil tend to rot and die. Excess water escapes through drainage holes. <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> says it is important to discard excess water after the soil is thoroughly moistened so that the soil can dry. If the pot sits in water after the soll is thoroughly moistened, the soil wlll absorb water as fast as it's lost to evaporation or taken up by plant roots. As a result, the spaces between soil particles will remain filled with water rather than air. Using clay pots with drainage holes and saucers is no guarantee that you wo n't overwater plants. <PERSON> Clay </PERSON> might be a good choice, however, if you tend to kill your plants with too much attention, says <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>. If you want the decorative look of glazed ceramic pots, simply place the porous clay pot inside the fancy container.

 The most critical time for young plants transplanted to your garden is the first week. Do n't plant such tender crops as tomatoes, peppers, petunias, impatiens and begonias until all danger of frost has ended. Planting too early is perhaps the major cause of loss of bedding plants. Some animal and insect problems can be averted with pesticides and other products available in garden shops. Buy good quality transplant seedlings as well as seeds. Short, compact, bushy plants with some side shoots already formed are better than tall, thin, straggly items that have had to stretch to reach light or are spindly due to overcrowded roots. In buying such popular bedding plants as tomatoes, marigolds, salvias and petunias, choose healthy, dark green color. Avoid plants with yellow, wilted or shrivelled leaves. If you buy seedlings in peat pots, gently remove the bottom of the pot and release the roots. While roots will penetrate the peat, which eventually will decompose, a dry period could keep roots pot-bound and hinder good development. Be careful not to tear the plant roots. Water all plants thoroughly immediately after transplanting.

 Many food crops, including strawberries, cherries, blueberries and sweet corn, suffer bird damage. One way to protect them is to float a special `` scare-eye'' balloon, reported successful in scaring birds ln <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. Other ways are to use firecrackers, sonic devices, carbide and propane cannons, rubber snakes, owl decoys and netting, but birds get used to these and their effectiveness diminishes. The `` scare-eye'' balloon is hung from trees or long poles to frighten away marauding birds. The balloons are made from heavy gauge, weather-proof vinyl, the size of basketballs. The manufacturer, <PERSON> Hartmann </PERSON>'s Plantation, Grand Junction, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>, says control is most effective with birds that flock, but that swallows, purple martins and songbirds are not frightened by the eye. <PERSON> Hartmann </PERSON>'s recommends two balloons per small garden, six per acre of orchard of farm crop.

 What do you do with the clippings after moving the lawn? Put them back into the earth with a mulching mower, say spokesmen at the <ORGANIZATION> Bolens </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. Mulching results in generally greener and healthier lawns because the nutrients are returned to the soil, they say Mulch particles decompose and are absorbed by the grass root system within 14 days.

 Root rot and crown rot, army worms and cutworms, blister beetles and Japanese beetles, lace bugs, mealy bugs and spittle bugs: this is just a sampling of the ills that plants are heir to. Some can be prevented; some treated by natural or chemical means. Many experts say that a healthy plant is less likely to succumb to illness or damage, while others say this may be more coincidence than direct cause and effect. But it's generally agreed that the conditions that make the plant healthy are also likely to help curb the spread of pests and disease. <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> <PERSON> Flagler </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Rutgers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> agricultural-resources management agent for <LOCATION> Bergen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, says that for a plant to be healthy, it must be suited to the conditions under which it will grow. Soil, moisture and light must all be appropriate. He and others suggest having soil tested. It can be done through the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION>'s Cooperative Extension services throughout the country. And there are kits for testing soil oneself. Some pests can be avoided or controlled through `` companion planting'' _ planting one plant as a decoy or pest repellent near another that one is cultivating. <PERSON> Thalassa </PERSON> <PERSON> Cruso </PERSON>, in `` Making Vegtetables Grow,'' suggests nasturtiums to lure aphids from cucumbers, marigolds to control root nematodes -LRB- microscopically small worms -RRB-, and plenty of garlic as an overall repellent. She also relays suggestions that dill will keep away tomato worms, mint provides insurance against ants, and radishes protect cucumbers, squash and melons. Rotating crops is another way to keep pests or disease from getting established. And gardeners can buy certified seed and plants bred to be disease-resistant. Also, isolate for a while any new plant you acquire through gift or purchase, so you can determine whether it is healthy. And do n't forget the bugs that eat other bugs, and the birds with their appetite for insects. A home gardener who has read up on the subject or had a bit of experience may be able to diagnose some plant problems: Highly visible white flies, the fine webs that spider mites leave on the underside of leaves, Japanese beetles. If a plant is cut off at the soil line, you may find a cutworm -LRB- a type of grub -RRB- in the surrounding soil. Remove and squash it. Remove-and-squash is not a particularly attractive idea, but it's also useful against tomato worms, slugs, Japanese beetles and the Japanese beetle grub, which resembles a cutworm Other plant ailments are harder to diagnose, and the gardener may wish to follow the suggestion of `` 1,000 Garden Questions, Vol. II,'' edited by <PERSON> Marjorie </PERSON> <PERSON> Dietz </PERSON>, and send a sample to the nearest Agricultural Experiment Station for analysis. In the case of some pests, a strong blast of water from a hose may drive them away. A spraying with insecticidal soap is another possible solution. Then there are the pesticides. Some _ rotenone and pyrethrum, for instance _ have organic sources. They come from plants. Others are chemical compounds. Garden experts urge one to use any pesticide exactly as directed. They warn, too, that what harms the pest may also hurt other insect or animal life. For instance, <PERSON> Elvin </PERSON> <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON>, director of special projects at the <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, Botanic Garden, says that systemic pesticides, working through the soil, may hurt friendly bacteria as well as harmful ones. For anyone inclined to blame geography for his gardening troubles, <PERSON> Dara </PERSON> <PERSON> Emery </PERSON>, a plant breeder at the <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Barbara </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, Botanic Garden, offers consolation of a sort: Most plant problems can occur anywhere. True, he says, <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> roses have less black spot and rust, but mildew and spotted mites still cause problems. And people in other parts of the country do n't have the problem of salts that get into the soil in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> through needed irrigation. Finally, the gardener pestered by pests can always resort to an old-fashioned solution mentioned by <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON>: Grow enough for everyone, including the insects.

 Is there such a thing as painless gardening? <PERSON> Judy </PERSON> <PERSON> Glatstein </PERSON>, an instructor in design at the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Botanical </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Garden </LOCATION> and herself a gardener in <LOCATION> Wilton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, says perhaps not _ but there are many things one can do to minimize the aches. Use tools appropriate to the job, she urges. If you're planting just a few bulbs, a trowel will do; for large quantities, dig up the area involved with a shovel or spade. Do n't use a heavy pump sprayer if you have only a few bushes or plants to spray. A small container with a hand trigger will do. Reading seed catalogs in winter is fun, but it wo n't keep you in shape for gardening in the spring. Mrs. <PERSON> Glatstein </PERSON>, <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> McGourty </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Norwalk </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, nurseryman who teaches at the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Botanical </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Garden </LOCATION>, and others urge exercise _ walking, swimming, other sports during the winter. And in the spring, start gardening slowly; do n't try to put in a full day right off Lifting is less likely to give gardeners aching backs if they bend the knees, grasp the item to be lifted, and then straighten up. Mrs. <PERSON> Glatstein </PERSON> also says heavy things should be carried _ if they must be carried _ close to the body. But she adds, `` Man invented the wheel for a reason,'' so get a wheelbarrow or garden cart for heavy moving. The bigger the wheels, the more maneuverable the cart. Knees ache from damp earth? Pads for kneeling can be purchased at garden centers or elsewhere _ or made at home, using scrap foam rubber. Or try raised beds, or a hanging garden, in pots. <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> <PERSON> Flagler </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Rutgers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> agricultural-resources management agent in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, says garden centers and garden supply catalogs offer all kinds of adaptive tools that make it possible for elderly or handicapped people to garden, and for anyone to garden more comfortably. Wood or aluminum handles can extend the length of standard shovels, hoes or cultivators. Low folding chairs and stools enable one to sit while weeding or hoeing. Attitude toward gardening may also contribute to pain or painlessness, some gardeners say. To keep up your morale, take on chores you can complete, urges Mrs. <PERSON> Glatstein </PERSON>. Then go on to something else. She says beginning gardeners should keep their gardens small and choose plants that are easy to maintain. <PERSON> Elvin </PERSON> <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON>, director of special projects at <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION> Botanic Garden in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, also urges gardeners to relax. `` If you think weeding hard dirt a curse, then you're more likely to get blisters,'' he says. Tools should feel comfortable to the user and should be used properly. Short or tall, strong or not so strong, the gardener buying a tool should look around until finding one that feels right. The Cooperative Extension service at <ORGANIZATION> Cornell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> State </LOCATION> offers these tips: _ Do n't leave a rake on the ground with the tines pointed upward. If you step on it, the handle may hit you in the face -LRB- and the tines could hurt your foot -RRB-. _ Wear gloves when picking up garden debris, in case there are thorns or other sharp items. _ Wear protective goggles when using power equipment, and a mask over mouth and nose when spraying with insecticide.

 <PERSON> Christian </PERSON> <PERSON> Dior </PERSON>, <PERSON> Anna </PERSON> <PERSON> Pavlova </PERSON> and the Empress <PERSON> Josephine </PERSON> found immortality in the rose garden, but the honor requires luck _ and lots of money. For centuries, rose breeders have named new varieties in honor of the heroic, the beautiful and the famous. But they wo n't guarantee the flower will catch the public's fancy. It costs up to $ 62,000 to buy the right to name a rose, says <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Kenwright </PERSON>, vice president of the <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rose </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Breeders </ORGANIZATION>. He said it can take as long as 15 years to develop a new blossom, and `` breeders are businessmen. They want some reward for their effort.'' <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s 17 professional breeders introduce only 35 new varieties each year on average, and only a fraction of those are available for private naming. Newspapers, charities and big businesses have roses named after them. There's a <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> Imperial rose and a Times rose. The Everest Double Fragrance is named after a storm window factory. One of the oldest and most famous cultivated roses is the fragile pink flower the French call Cuisse de Nymphe _ Nymph's Thigh. The British, who have grown it for 500 years, prefer to call it Great Maiden's <PERSON> Blush </PERSON>. A blossom named after a factory might smell as sweet, but could it so perfectly evoke the silken cheek of youth? In the depths of winter, a rose catalog with its mysterious and seductive names offers a promise of spring. There is Eglantine, Celestial, Rose d'Amour, <PERSON> Black </PERSON> <PERSON> Prince </PERSON> and the splendid crimson Cardinal <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Richelieu </PERSON>. Even rosa horrida, described in one catalog as `` a strange, gooseberry-like bush'' from the 18th century, appeals to the curiosity. There are dashing dukes, <PERSON> Grandpa </PERSON> <PERSON> Dickson </PERSON> and the dress designer Dior. But the honors go mostly to the ladies: <PERSON> Penelope </PERSON>, ballet dancer <PERSON> Anna </PERSON> <PERSON> Pavlova </PERSON>, dozens of duchesses and <PERSON> Ma </PERSON> <PERSON> Perkins </PERSON>. Roses have inspired wonderful tales about their origin: A jealous goddess created the flower to rival <PERSON> Venus </PERSON>' beauty; the first rose sprang from the sweat of the prophet <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> or fell from the hair of <LOCATION> Aurora </LOCATION> as she combed her golden locks. One of history's greatest rose lovers, <PERSON> Napoleon </PERSON>'s empress <PERSON> Josephine </PERSON>, grew every known rose of the day at <LOCATION> Malmaison </LOCATION> chateau and is honored by the pale pink Souvenir de la <LOCATION> Malmaison </LOCATION>. The unfortunate Atom Bomb, reputedly quite a nice red rose, never caught on and disappeared from the catalogs soon after its introduction in 1954. Some say the Peace rose by any other name might not have become one of the most popular modern varieties. Bred in southern <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> during World War II and shipped out of the country just before <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON>'s armies invaded, it was named in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> on the day <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> fell to the Allies. Hundreds of Peace blooms were sent to the first <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> in 1945. It was planted in gardens and at memorials, and by the mid-1950s, an estimated 30 million of the bushes had been sold. Few dare to speak ill of this famous yellow rose tinged with pink, but some mutter under their breath that it has no fragrance, and can a rose be a rose be a rose without perfume?

 Arugula. <PERSON> Cardoon </PERSON>. Gobo. Scorzonera. No, they're not rare diseases, nor are they foreign phrases that will get your face slapped. They are among dozens of new and unusual gourmet vegetables _ some call them `` designer vegetables'' _ on a list compiled for home gardeners and commercial growers by a <ORGANIZATION> Cornell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> vegetable crop specialist. Unconventional crops have become increasingly popular in recent years, says <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kline </PERSON>, a senior extension associate for <ORGANIZATION> Cornell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cooperative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Extension </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> in </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Life </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION> at the <LOCATION> Ithaca </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, school. <PERSON> Kline </PERSON> attributes the interest to the increase in health-conscious consumers, who eat more conventional vegetables and are looking for diversity. `` The market for these unconventional vegetables will continue to expand,'' he says, `` and vegetable growers in the Northeast should have a share of that growing market.'' Similar conclusions have been reached by <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> VanVranken </PERSON>, an agricultural agent in <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, for the <ORGANIZATION> Rutgers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cooperative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Extension </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. At a recent convention of the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jersey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Annual </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Vegetable </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Meeting </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> VanVranken </PERSON> said that baby carrots, endive, radicchio, oriental radishes, fennel, and mung beans are some of the vegetable varieties that restaurant chefs love to experiment with and home cooks are not afraid to try. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bidner </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> RLB </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Distributors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Caldwell </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, said, `` A few years ago, if I tried to introduce the avocado to a grocer, he would have laughed me out the door. Not anymore. There's a national preoccupation with health and fitness, and waves of new immigrants, and sophisticated consumers who read food magazines.'' That's one of the reasons that <ORGANIZATION> Cornell </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Kline </PERSON> developed his list of more than 240 varieties of some 50 crops, based on field trials conducted over the past three years. His recommended crops range from <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> artichoke to a rare tomato called `` tomatillo'' that yields golf-ball-sized fruit inside papery sheathes, or capsules. It is used to make salsa, a spicy sauce. Arugula? That's a spicy, leafy vegetable used in salads. Gobo is a root crop popular in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Cardoon </PERSON> is a leafy vegetable with a wide `` vein'' in the middle; only the vein is eaten. And scorzonera is a type of salsify known as `` vegetable oyster'' or `` oyster plant'' because its black-skinned roots taste somewhat like oysters. Other exotic crops recommended include radicchio, a type of chicory that forms a head much like lettuce; witloof, a Belgian endive; Chinese artichoke, which produces very small potato-like tubers, and escarole, a kind of endive with flatter leaves.

 Remember `` The Day of the Triffids,'' the science-fiction thriller in which a hail of seeds blossom into fast-growing plants? Or the musical `` Little Shop of Horrors,'' in which a talking, moving plant takes over control? These, it seemed, were the stuff movies and fantasies were made of. But a <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Miami </ORGANIZATION> biophysicist says there actually are plants that move. `` Most plants do n't move,'' says <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON>, one of a handful of scientists interested in how plants move _ and why they bother. `` But a surprising number do, although they do n't go walking around the ground like triffids,'' which are technically three-parted leaves. Twelve or 14 plant families have members that can move their leaves relatively rapidly, says the biophysicist at the <LOCATION> Coral </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gables </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, school. The leaves of one `` sensitive'' plant, he says, fold up and seem to draw away when touched. `` They're an extreme example because they move so rapidly,'' he says. Many legumes, members of the pea family, are capable of conspicuous motion. Others, more commonly, react to sunlight and water. <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> says that he hopes by studying plants that are capable of movement, more can be learned about what conditions are important for all plants. `` I use them like a little computer,'' says <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON>. `` They can readjust the position of their leaves for various conditions of sun, heat, water and so forth. So, observing them is like telling the plant, ` Find me the leaf angle you like best in these conditions.' And the plant responds. And that response, we assume, is telling us what's best for it. `` In this way, we can begin to understand the needs of other plants that ca n't move.'' He says that understanding the needs of plants may lead to the adjustment of conditions for plants, to the benefit of people.

 Avid gardeners are careful to protect their ferns from bright sunlight, their roses from harmful aphids and their lawns from drought _ but unfortunately they often do n't take the same care to protect their eyes. According to the American <ORGANIZATION> Optometric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, nearly 3,400 Americans suffer eye injuries from lawn mowers and home gardening equipment every year, and most of the injuries could be prevented with safety eyewear. Regular prescription glasses or contact lenses are not enough, the association says. Although eyeglasses are by federal regulation impact-resistant, they are not safety glasses and are no match for rocks tossed up by power mowers. Also, notes the industry trade group, spray or dust from weed killers and fertilizers can get around regular glasses and into the eyes. Since contact lenses offer little protection, the optometrists add, non-prescription safely eyewear should be worn over them. They also suggest that inexpensive plastic safety goggles sold at hardware and department stores _ or types that fit over prescription eyewear _ will meet most home gardeners' eye safety needs. However, the association advises buyers to make sure the goggles meet <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Standards </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> standards by looking for the manufacturer's monogram on the lenses. Like many plants, gardener's eyes should be protected from the sun's harmful rays. Quality sunglases can do the job and provide comfort by reducing glare, the optometrists say, recommending a medium or dark gray tint because it does not distort colors. Sunglasses, they add, should screen out 75 to 90 percent of the sunlight. Gardeners need good vision to read the instructions on seed packages, fertilizer bags and weed killer cans, to detect weeds and to spot fungi or insects on plants.

<TEXT>
 One plant not valued by gardeners is poison ivy. Rashes resulting from poison ivy encounters most often occur in summer, when it thrives and victims are lightly dressed. The best thing, of course, is to recognize and avoid the plant. But if you make contact, act quickly and thoroughly to minimize the discomfort. Here are some pointers recommended by the <ORGANIZATION> 3M </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aid </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>: _ Remember that the poison is in the sap found on leaves or roots, not the leaves themselves. _ Choose clothing that offers the best coverage if you're going to be gardening in an area where there might be poison ivy. Long pants, socks, long sleeves and gloves are advised. _ Clothes that have come into contact with the sap can spread the infection, so remove them carefully and wash them immediately. Treat garden equipment, particularly handles, the same way. _ If your skin comes into contact with the sap, wash the area right away. Washing with soap and water two or three times may even prevent your getting a rash, though that ultimately depends on your own sensitivity to the toxins in the sap. _ Itching and rash probably will appear from 24 to 48 hours after contact. Keep the area clean and dry. If blisters develop, clean and dress the affected area, especially if the skin is broken, since a secondary infection may set in. _ If the rash is widespread or keeps you from getting on with your daily activities, contact your doctor. Prescription steroids taken orally may bring relief in serious cases, but do n't rely on over-the-counter steroid creams, because they wo n't help. _ If the rash is localized, the best thing is to let the condition run its course, usually two or three weeks.

 A healthy green lawn may still be possible this season even if it suffered damage in last summer's heat and drought. If more than half of the lawn is in good shape, it can be rescued by renovation and overseeding, according to <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Tracinski </PERSON>, consumer information manager for <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Deere </PERSON>, manufacturers of lawn and garden equipment. Renovation includes cleaning the lawn of weeds, thatch and debris. Overseeding is planting new seed over the entire area. `` Not only will renovation take care of the trouble spots, it's a beneficial treatment for the existing lawn,'' <PERSON> Tracinski </PERSON> says. He suggests starting the rehabilitation by testing the soil, so that its lime and fertilizer needs can be determined. The testing can be done by most county extension offices for a small charge. Prepare the samples by cutting thin slices six or seven inches below the lawn's surface, including soil from several areas of the lawn. Put them into clean containers labeled with information about the location of the soil and what you intend to plant there. Next, remove unwanted weeds and grasses, using a herbicide that will not leave a residue that might harm healthy grass or new seedlings. Expect to wait several weeks before attempting to plant new seed. Thatch, a layer of leaves, dead grass and other debris, accumulates between the grass blades and the soil surface. It can build up thickly enough to prevent water and nutrients from getting to the soil, and it can harbor pests and disease. The easiest way to deal with it is by using a thatching machine or thatching attachments for riding mowers and lawn tractors, which can be rented. These function as mechanical rakes, cutting into the lawn vertically and slicing the debris with sharp blades or tines. Then the soil should be loosened up and aerated, to allow air, water and nutrients to pass through to the roots of the grass. Aerating can be done manually by punching holes in the soil with a large spike or by a machine that can be rented. It's easiest to work on a damp lawn. If the soil test points to lime or fertilizer, add them next. For most lawns, a fertilizer ratio of three parts nitrogen, one part phosphorus, and two parts potassium works best. Use no more than one pound of nitrogen per 1,000 square feet of lawn. The ground is now ready for new seed, which should be spread evenly over the area, raking it in lightly with the bare soil. Seeds should be covered with no more than one-quarter inch of soil. Finish and maintain the lawn with regular sprinkling, fertilizing and mowing. In hot, dry weather, water several times a day.

 A method of increasing vegetable yields using available resources, developed by a <ORGANIZATION> Cornell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> graduate, is bringing better nutrition to people in underdeveloped Third World nations. Called `` bio-intensive gardening,'' the technique depends on local conditions and uses available plant and animal wastes rather than expensive imported fertilizers. Coupled with basic knowledge about crop rotation and companion planting best for small plots, the method has increased vegetable crop yields wherever it has been tried. <PERSON> Julian </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonsalves </PERSON>, senior researcher at the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reconstruction </ORGANIZATION> in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>, developed bio-intensive gardening while a graduate student at <LOCATION> Cornell </LOCATION>. His demonstration project in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> started with three rural villages and grew to 224 villages by the second growing season. In each village, several local farmers were trained in the technique, including seed bed preparation, use of organic fertilizers, composting and natural pest control. The farmers applied the techniques to small family vegetable plots, usually about 200 square feet. They followed up with discussions with <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> technicians about problems encountered, such as soil erosion after heavy rain. Technicians then could devise techniques to deal with the problem, using available resources. Bio-intensive farming has been used successfully in both high-rainfall and arid climates.

 What is a good houseplant for an office where the air may be dry in winter and the light is n't great? Try a <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> evergreen -LRB- aglaonema commutatum -RRB-, which tolerates dry air and temperatures ranging from 85 degrees to 60 degrees or lower and does well in low light. Water this plant when the soil surface feels dry to keep the roots moist but not drenched.

<TEXT>
 Your houseplant ferns turn brown and dry. What's the problem? Ferns often are challenging to grow in the house because they usually prefer cool temperatures -LRB- a maximum of about 72 degrees in the daytime -RRB-, indirect light, moist soil and humid air. <PERSON> Browning </PERSON> and drying of frond tips and yellowing and drooping of interior leaves usually mean that the air is too dry. Place ferns in an area of the house that is naturally more humid, such as the kitchen, bathroom or laundry room. Or place plants in trays of wet gravel and use a room humidifier to add moisture to the air. The humidifier may help your comfort, too.

 Vegetable spaghetti can be used the same way as the pasta. It's a hard-shelled squash with spaghetti-like pulp. Grow it like any other garden squash, harvesting it when the shell is hard. To prepare, scoop out the pulp and cook in boiling water, or boil the squash whole first and scoop it out after. Serve with your favorite spaghetti sauce.

 Intelligent neglect is what cactus plants need in winter. Cacti are essentially dormant then and susceptible to overwatering. Keep them in a cool area _ 40-45 degrees _ and water monthly. Do n't feed them, either. Watering and fertilizing them may make them rot.

 If houseplants on windowsills develop black blotches on leaves and some become droopy, it could be cold injury. Many of these plants originated in the tropics and can easily be damaged easily by low or freezing temperatures. Leaves that touch cold window glass in winter may freeze and turn black, especially if closed drapes or blinds deprive the plant of heated air in the room. A remedy is to increase light levels for plants by grouping them under fluorescent lamps rather than crowding them against cold windows.

 If your garden is shady, try growing leafy crops such as lettuce and other salad greens. They will grow in partial shade, with two or three hours of sun daily, less than the six to eight hours needed by other vegetables. Also try endive, spinach, parsley and tarragon.

 Want to make some gourmet herb vinegar? Organic Gardening magazine says it's easy with white or cider vinegar and fresh-picked garden herbs. Thyme, basil, marjoram, tarragon, rosemary, fennel, chervil, dill or mint are good choices. Put about a cup of fresh herbs, chopped coarsely, and two or three cups of vinegar in a clear jar or bottle. Cap the jar and set on a sunny windowsill for about two weeks to let flavors mellow. Then strain the vinegar into a clean jar and insert a fresh herb stalk for easy identification and an attractive appearance.

 Cynoglossum, also known as Chinese forget-me-not, is an annual that will reproduce itself in any corner of the yard or garden if the seeds are not removed. If you do n't want to weed it out in the spring, cut back the bloom stalks before the seeds ripen. Impatiens -LRB- also called sultana -RRB- is not winter hardy, but you can pot it and take it indoors before frost. It makes a nice house plant but requires a sunny place indoors for blooming.

 Cut sprays of parsley and sage and spread them on a piece of paper over a wire rack. Set the rack in a shaded, airy place, and in about 10 days the sprays will dry. Then strip the leaves from the stem, crumple them until they are fine, and store in a glass jar for use as seasoning during winter months.

 If your family enjoys greens, plant Swiss chard. It's a heavy producer, and both leaves and stalks can be used. You can cook the green leaves as you would spinach or use them as salad greens. The stripped stalks can be cooked alone like celery.

<HEAD>Stocks Fall From Record Level</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>'s leading index today fell back from its latest record high, and the dollar dropped against the Japanese yen. The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, which climbed 140.56 points to a record high closing of 32,452.49 on Thursday, fell 166.72 points, or 0.51 percent, ending at 32,285.77 Monday. Financial markets in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> were closed Friday for the state funeral for Emperor <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>. The index opened lower in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> today following Friday's sharp drop in the Dow Jones industrial average in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, but investors' expectations for a higher index pushed up prices somewhat, said a dealer with <ORGANIZATION> Nikko </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> After a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> interest rate hike, the <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION> industrial average fell 43.92 points to a 2,245.54 closing, bringing the week's total losses to 79.28 points, the average's biggest weekly drop since it fell 81.61 points last August. On Friday, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> increased its discount rate, its charge for loans to private financial institutions, from 6.5 percent to 7 percent, calling this a step to defuse `` inflationary pressures'' in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economy. In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>'s afternoon session, many investors moved to the sidelines to see how trading goes in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s session, the <ORGANIZATION> Nikko </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> dealer said, speaking on condition of anonymity. He said another reason for the <ORGANIZATION> Nikkei </ORGANIZATION>'s drop was some investors selling in spot trading and buying cheaper issues in the futures market. In today's trading, `` almost 50 percent of institutional investors remained on the sidelines,'' the dealer said, and first section volume was estimated at 1.1 billion issues. In currency dealings, `` trading today was inactive and boring,'' said <PERSON> Mitsuhiko </PERSON> <PERSON> Kinugasa </PERSON> with <ORGANIZATION> Daiwa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>. The dollar closed at 126.00 yen, down 0.29 yen from Thursday's 126.29-yen finish The dollar opened at 125.90 yen and ranged between 125.75 yen and 126.02 yen. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> currency now has lost 1.15 yen in the last three trading days. The currency market also was closed Friday for the emperor's funeral <PERSON> Kinugasa </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> interest rate hike had little influence on the dollar in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> `` because Japanese investors already had expected the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> to raise its rate.'' Concerns over a possible interest hike in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> after a bank meeting scheduled Thursday discouraged major moves on the <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> currency market, he said. `` But participants were inclined to dollar-selling,'' he added.

<HEAD>Business Forecast: Slower Growth but no Recession</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Economics Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Economic growth will slow significantly this year while inflation and interest rates both rise, but the country should be able to avoid a recession, the nation's top business economists predicted today. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economists </ORGANIZATION> says a survey of its members found them slightly more optimistic about the economy's fortunes in 1989 than they were just three months ago However, three out of four of the economists still believe President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will have to deal with an economic downturn in the first two years of his presidency. That represented a decline from the 89 percent who last November expected a recession by the end of 1990, and the number predicting a recession this year showed an even bigger drop _ from 40 percent three months ago to 19 percent now. But the belief that the current expansion, which has already lasted a peacetime record of six years, will keep steaming ahead for two more years is still a minority view held by just one-fourth of the economists surveyed. The median forecast for growth this year, as measured by the gross national product, was 2.7 percent, up slightly from a 2.5 percent estimate made three months ago. That is still one-half percentage point lower than the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration's estimate that the GNP will expand at the robust clip of 3.2 percent in 1989. The administration is counting on faster growth to bring in more revenues and help it lower the budget deficit without the need to resort to higher taxes. On the question of interest rates, another critical component of the budget deficit because of the cost of financing the $ 2.7 trillion national debt, the business economists see short-term rates hitting a peak of 8.5 percent this year and then beginning to decline to 7.8 percent by the end of 1989. The administration is forecasting substantially lower rates for this year. The survey was taken before the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> boosted the discount rate on Friday to a three-year high of 7 percent. An increase in the discount rate, the interest the central bank charges to make loans to commercial banks, is the most dramatic gesture the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> can make to show its determination to push the cost of credit higher and dampen inflationary pressures. The business economists expressed strong support for the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>'s inflation-fighting battle, with 70 percent expecting the board to boost interest rates further in the next six months While expressing an urgent need for <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the administration to reach an agreement on a credible deficit reduction plan, the business economists generally supported <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s stand against new taxes. Only about 15 percent of those surveyed said they believed tax increases should be emphasized over cutting government spending. Among the government programs which should face the knife, a large majority of the economists, 72 percent, favored slashing farm subsidies. Cuts in military spending were favored by 55 percent while 47 percent believed Social Security cost-of-living increases should be pared to reduce the budget deficit. Among those who advocated raising taxes to help get the deficit under control, the overwhelming favorite place to look was an increase in the gasoline tax, preferred by 71 percent, followed by 51 percent who said user fees for government services should be increased. On other topics, the business economists said: _ Inflation will worsen this year with consumer prices climbing by 4.8 percent, compared to an increase of 4.4 percent in both 1987 and 1988 _ The merchandise trade deficit, which dropped by 20 percent to $ 137 billion last year, will continue improving but at a slower rate in 1989, falling by 12 percent to $ 120 billion _ Unemployment will show little change, averaging 5.5 percent for the year, the same as in 1988 This estimate was based on a belief that the economy will be expanding enough to take care of new entrants into the labor force but not fast enough to make further inroads in the jobless rate. _ Personal consumption spending, which accounts for two-thirds of overall economic activity, will grow by 2.5 percent this year, little changed from last year, with new housing starts and new auto sales remaining close to last year's levels The survey on economic projections was based on responses from 69 economists who make up the association's economic forecasting panel while the assessments of budgetary and monetary policy came from a broader survey of nearly 300 of the association's members.

<HEAD>Aircraft Accident Another Reflection On Boeing's Name</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-Plane Emergency, Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Another air disaster involving a <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> plane has officials of the Seattle-based manufacturer shaking their heads over what appears to be a lengthy bout with bad luck. On Friday, a huge hole ripped open in the fuselage of a <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 747 shortly after it took off from <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>, and nine people died when they were sucked from the aircraft. The pilot was able to land the crippled plane at <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION>. Federal investigators believe failed cargo door locks may be responsible, but <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> officials have not come to any conclusions. Although <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION>'s business is booming, it's not been a good year for the aerospace giant, which has seen a number of mishaps and accidents involving its jets. It also is dealing with an embarrassing delay in shipping its newest airplane, the long-range 747-400, and reports of miswiring in some newer <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> models. `` What you have here is a series of events, and the only correlation is that they're happening in the same time frame, but if you dissect each one you will find that they're totally unrelated,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Jimenez </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> Commercial Airplanes. With news reports of problems in rapid succession, however, `` it does become one large blur to the public,'' <PERSON> Jimenez </PERSON> said. `` The planes carry the <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> name and it reflects on the <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> image any time there's an accident no matter what the cause,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Wheeler </PERSON>. `` We're concerned about what happens to every airplane throughout its life.'' Friday's tragedy was chillingly reminiscent of an April 28, 1988, accident in which a flight attendant was killed and 61 people hurt when the top of an <ORGANIZATION> Aloha </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 737 built in the late 1960s peeled off at 24,000 feet during a flight over <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>. That accident focused attention on the question of how long aging aircraft can fly. More recent events that have focused attention on <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> planes include the Dec. 21 terrorist bombing of a <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> 747 over <LOCATION> Lockerbie </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>, in which 259 people on the plane and 11 on the ground were killed; the January crash of a British <ORGANIZATION> Midland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> 737 in <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, killing 44 people; and the Feb. 8 crash of a chartered 707 in the <LOCATION> Azores </LOCATION>, which left 144 dead. Whatever the public perception of <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION>'s name, the people who buy the planes are voting with their checkbooks. Last year, <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> broke industry records for new aircraft orders at 636 commercial jets worth nearly $ 30 billion. About 65 percent of all commercial jets in the air are Boeings. Production lines are backed up two years or more at <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> and its two competitors, <ORGANIZATION> McDonnell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Douglass </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Airbus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industrie </ORGANIZATION>, and industry analysts say the boom should continue into the mid-1990s.

<TEXT>
 Seven years ago, <PERSON> Milton </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> entered a living nightmare. The American Steel Foundries plant where he had worked for 19 years closed. Bills mounted as he struggled to find work, and unemployment put a strain on his marriage, which ended in divorce. He sought professional help to calm his nerves. `` When we shut down, most of us said we're gon na' get a two, three month's rest,'' <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, 51, recalled. `` Six months later when your unemployment runs out, you say, ` Hey, what's gon na happen to me?' `` Then, a year later, it's a nightmare.'' <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> finally found work as a supervisor in another steel-related plant in this Southern <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> community, where he now makes between $ 30,000 and $ 40,000 annually. But this week, he was overjoyed to learn <ORGANIZATION> ASF </ORGANIZATION> plans to resume production at its foundry, once the nation's largest producer of railroad undercarriages, and that he is eligible for recall. The foundry's revival is a godsend for more than 200 workers who expect to be rehired. An estimated 650 employees were laid off when the plant shut down in late 1982. `` I ca n't think of anything else that would make me happier than to see this plant open up,'' <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said. `` I have tears in my eyes right now.'' At its peak in 1979, when <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> manufacturers produced about 94,000 railroad cars, the foundry employed about 1,700 people, said <ORGANIZATION> ASF </ORGANIZATION> president <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Berg </PERSON>. But then the railroad parts industry collapsed, spurred by deregulation and an oversupply of cars. In the early 1980s, the industry faced a surplus of nearly 300,000 railroad cars, said <PERSON> Elwyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Ahnquist </PERSON>, president of the Chicago-based <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Railway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Car </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, a father of two who lives in nearby <LOCATION> Venice </LOCATION> across the <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>, said he was devastated when the foundry shut down, and had to scramble to feed his children. `` You can tell them you ai n't got a job, but how do you tell them you ai n't got no food?'' But the dark days are ending now. The surplus is over, <PERSON> Berg </PERSON> said, and many of the 1.2 million cars in use now are obsolete or near that stage. In May, he said, the foundry will resume producing cast steel side frames and bolsters, which form the undercarriages, or trucks, of railroad cars. Already, the plant has 35 employees getting it ready for reopening, and in the next couple of weeks, another 30 will be added to complete preparations, plant manager <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Donovan </PERSON> said. By early summer, the company expects to recall 200 more workers at roughly a $ 10 hourly wage. The <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Railway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Car </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, an association of railroad car makers, projects the manufacture of about 25,000 cars for 1989, <PERSON> Ahnquist </PERSON> said. Since the early 1980s, <PERSON> Berg </PERSON> said, <ORGANIZATION> ASF </ORGANIZATION> pumped more than $ 14 million into the foundry for improvements. In 1988, it spent about $ 1 million to ready the plant for possible production. `` We're really tickled,'' <PERSON> Berg </PERSON> said. `` We're really excited about this thing.'' So is <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, who calls <ORGANIZATION> ASF </ORGANIZATION> `` the best company to work for. `` Whether I go back or not, I am concerned about my co-workers,'' <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said. `` Hopefully, they'll be able to go to work at <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steel </ORGANIZATION> and say, ` Hey! Once again I'm a working man. I have my pride back.'''

 The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> dramatically escalated its fight against inflation by raising its key bank lending rate to the highest level in three years to dampen upward pressure on prices. The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>'s action Friday repudiated recent <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration claims that price increases have n't been serious enough to warrant higher interest rates. Private analysts said the move was long overdue and should have been stronger.

<HEAD>Japan to Change Monitoring Provision of Semiconductor Pact</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID THURBER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> has decided to alter its monitoring of overseas computer chip prices, one of the key provisions of a semiconductor agreement between it and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, an official said Monday. Under the pact, reached in 1985, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> pledged it would monitor the prices of Japanese memory chips sold in third countries as a means of discouraging their resale in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> at cheap prices. The agreement resulted from a series of complaints by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> semiconductor makers that Japanese companies had sold memory chips in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> below their fair market price, a practice known as dumping. The monitoring provision has been sharply criticized by <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> countries, which charged it regulated prices in other nations and therefore violated the rules of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, an international trade organization. In a ruling last March, the <ORGANIZATION> GATT </ORGANIZATION> said the European complaint was valid. `` The third-country monitoring is not consistent with the <ORGANIZATION> GATT </ORGANIZATION>, so we will have to modify the agreement,'' said <PERSON> Taizo </PERSON> <PERSON> Nakatomi </PERSON>, an official in the <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industry </ORGANIZATION>. He said a high ministry official, <PERSON> Tetsu </PERSON> <PERSON> Mizuno </PERSON>, left for <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> on Sunday to discuss a modification of the pact with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade officials. The <ORGANIZATION> Yomiuri </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shimbun </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s largest newspaper, reported that <PERSON> Mizuno </PERSON> will seek <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> consent to discontinue the third-country monitoring. But <PERSON> Nakatomi </PERSON> said <PERSON> Mizuno </PERSON> had no concrete position and would try to reach a compromise with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> on how to change the provision. `` Under the arrangement with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, we have an obligation to monitor prices and sales. But the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> is saying that we have to completely modify the provision. That's a dilemma for us,'' Nakatomi said. He said the Japanese government hoped to find a `` middle ground between the two extremes.'' In the bilateral semiconductor agreement, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> also pledged to set a `` fair price'' for exports of certain key memory chips to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, establish a `` supply and demand forecast committee'' intended to stabilize prices and supply of memory chips, and increase the sales of U.S.-made semiconductors in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. In April 1987, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> imposed $ 300 million in tariffs on <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> as a penalty for having allegedly violated the agreement by continuing to dump memory chips and reneging on the pledge to improve market access. Two months later, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> reduced the penalties by $ 135 million after ruling that Japanese makers had stopped dumping, leaving $ 165 million still in effect because of the market share issue. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> claims it has removed market restrictions and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> companies must try harder if they want to increase their sales in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. European countries are currently negotiating a separate semiconductor pact with <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> that would regulate prices of Japanese-made memory chips in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> but not in other nations, news reports say. The agreement also would not include any pledge by <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> to increase sales of European chips inside <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, the economic weekly <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION> reported.

The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> sets margin rules to limit the amount of unsecured debt used to back the purchase of stock.

There have been more than two dozen legal challenges to the project by environmentalists, local residents, business owners and others who say it will destroy historic landmarks. The plans include redevelopment of 13 acres centered on 42nd Street between Seventh and Eighth Avenues.

<HEAD>Court Won't Revive Indiana Affirmative Action Plan</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> today refused to revive an affirmative action program in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bend </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ind. </LOCATION>, that called for hiring more blacks and Hispanics as firefighters and police officers. The court, without comment, let stand a ruling that struck down the plan after it was challenged by a white man denied a job as a firefighter. The justices themselves last Jan. 23 struck down an affirmative action plan in <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, that set aside 30 percent of all public works contracts for minority-owned businesses. In that decision, the court made it more difficult for local and state governments to adopt affirmative action plans that feature strict racial quotas. The justices already have under study, and are expected to decide by July, an affirmative action case involving minority promotions in the <LOCATION> Birmingham </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ala. </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Fire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. The 7th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> ruled last December that the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bend </LOCATION> plan amounted to unlawful reverse discrimination because it was based solely on a disparity between the percentage of minorities in the city's population and minorities in the police and fire departments. Such statistical evidence is too generalized to warrant depriving qualified whites of jobs, the appeals court said. `` The ax falls because the statistical comparison upon which the city based its plan focused not on the relevant qualified area labor pool but on general population statistics,'' the appeals court said. South Bend officials, in developing a voluntary affirmative action program in 1979, noted that the city's minority population was 14 percent while blacks and Hispanics held only 5.3 percent of the fire department jobs. The plan was aimed at raising the minority composition of the firefighting force to equal the minority make-up of the city within five years. The city hired four minority applicants to the fire department and one white in November 1980. All passed a qualifying test. <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Janowiak </PERSON> placed second on the list of white applicants. He accused the city of racial discrimination when he was not hired. The 7th Circuit court ruled previously that <PERSON> Janowiak </PERSON> was the victim of illegal bias. But that ruling was set aside last year by the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, which then ordered the appeals court to restudy the case in light of recent affirmative action rulings by the justices. The 7th Circuit court reaffirmed its previous ruling after the new review. The appeals court noted that the high court last year upheld the promotion of a woman to a county transportation job in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> over a marginally better-qualified man. But the appeals court said that case is distinct in key respects from the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bend </LOCATION> plan for giving preferential treatment to minorities. The appeals court said that in the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> case there was a `` manifest imbalance'' between the number of women employed by the county in skilled craft positions and the number of women in the local labor pool of skilled craft workers. `` What constitutes a manifest imbalance ... remains unclear,'' the appeals court said. But it said that in any event, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bend </LOCATION> officials did not focus on the relevant qualified area labor pool _ but rather on the general city minority population _ in adopting an affirmative action plan. `` South Bend's voluntary affirmative action plan, therefore, fails to pass -LRB- legal -RRB- muster,'' the appeals court said. The case is South Bend vs. <PERSON> Janowiak </PERSON>, 87-1754.

 An oil newsletter reported Monday that six non-members of the <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exporting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Countries </ORGANIZATION> will cut production by 180,000 barrels a day in the second quarter of 1989 to help stabilize oil prices.

The Middle East Economic Survey reported the six countries' and barrel-per-day cuts are: <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> 68,000; <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> 31,000; <LOCATION> Oman </LOCATION> 28,000; <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> 24,000; <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Yemen </LOCATION> 20,000; and <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION> 17,000. `` However, a question mark still hangs over the biggest fish of all _ the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>,'' the newsletter said. It said the <ORGANIZATION> USSR </ORGANIZATION>, with other countries, agreed to go back to its authorities to determine its contribution to the cuts. <ORGANIZATION> MEES </ORGANIZATION> said the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> told the <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> meeting it shared the philosophy of cuts and `` might announce some measures next week.''

Houston-based <ORGANIZATION> Hughes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tool </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, an oil toolmaker company that merged with <ORGANIZATION> Baker </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Orange </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, has kept track of the rig count since 1940. In December 1981 at the height of the oil boom, the rig count reached a peak of 4,500. But oil prices plunged to less than $ 10 per 42-gallon barrel in the summer of 1986, prompting a collapse in the rig count that bottomed out at 663 _ the lowest since <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON> began compiling figures. Among major oil producing states, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> saw the biggest decline with 14; followed by <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, five each; <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, three each; <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>, two; and <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION>, one each. <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> saw the only increases with rises of four and three, respectively.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> today agreed to decide whether an <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> insurance company may sue in federal court to challenge a <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> man's worker compensation award. The justices said they will use the case to decide whether worker compensation insurers can get into federal court with such challenges when the employer they insure is based in the same state as the allegedly injured employee. <ORGANIZATION> Northbrook </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, is the insurer for <ORGANIZATION> Whitmore </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Line </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Clearance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>.

Legal papers submitted to the high court did not describe <PERSON> Brewer </PERSON>'s work or his injuries, or the size of the award he won. The legal documents also did not state in what <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> city <LOCATION> Whitmore </LOCATION> is based. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, dismissed the case after ruling that he lacked the jurisdiction to hear it. The 5th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> upheld <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>'s ruling last Sept. 13. The appeals court said <LOCATION> Northbrook </LOCATION> could get into federal court, under a doctrine called `` diversity jurisdiction,'' only if <PERSON> Whitmore </PERSON> were based in a state other than that where <PERSON> Brewer </PERSON> resided. In the appeal acted on today, lawyers for the insurance company said other federal appeals courts have not restricted federal court access in that way.

<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar fell against most major currencies Monday in busy European trading marked by strong interest in the West German currency. Gold prices were mixed. Foreign exchange dealers said the Deutsche mark firmed amid continued speculation that the <ORGANIZATION> Bundesbank </ORGANIZATION>, the West German central bank, would raise interest rates. The bank has a council meeting scheduled for Thursday. Interest in the mark, coupled with worries over the British economy, combined to hurt the pound despite repeated intervention by the Bank of <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>. On the whole, interest in the dollar was dampened by active trading in the mark and sterling. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, one British pound cost $ 1.7440 dollars, less expensive for buyers than $ 1.7520 late Friday. Other late dollar rates, compared with late Friday: 1.8150 West German marks, down from 1.8270; 1.5495 Swiss francs, down from 1.5602; 6.1775 French francs, down from 6.2265; 2.0490 Dutch guilderslire, down from 1,350.00; and 1.2025 Canadian dollars, up from 1.9990. In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, where trading ends before <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s business day begins, the dollar closed at 126.00 yen, down 0.29 yen from Thursday's close Japanese financial markets were closed Friday because of the state funeral of Emperor <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>. Later, in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, it was quoted at 126.35 yen. Bullion dealers said the dollar's softness nudged gold prices higher, but that each time gold moves up to the $ 391-an ounce level profit-taking brings it back down. Gold traded late in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> at a bid price of $ 389.00 a troy ounce, down from $ 390.20 bid late Friday. In <LOCATION> Zurich </LOCATION>, the bid price was $ 390.25, up from $ 389.00 bid late Friday. Earlier, in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, gold rose $ 1.61 to close at a bid $ 392.94 an ounce. Silver was quoted in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> at a bid price of $ 5.93 a troy ounce, down from Friday's $ 6.04.

<HEAD>Housing Construction Declines 1 Percent In Fourth Quarter</HEAD>
<HEAD>For release after 6:30 p.m. EST</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Housing construction starts declined 1 percent in the fourth quarter compared with the same period of 1987 and the apartment market remained especially weak, according to a private report Monday. For all of 1988, construction was begun on 9 percent fewer dwelling units than in 1987, F.W. <ORGANIZATION> Dodge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> McGraw-Hill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> said. Housing starts declined 14 percent in 1987 from 1986. `` The stability of single-family home building over the past few years stands in sharp contrast to the virtual collapse of apartment construction,'' <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Christie </PERSON>, chief economist of F.W. Dodge, said in a written statement. Single-family home construction fell 7 percent over the two years from 1986 to 1988, to 1.01 million units, while multi-family dwelling construction plummeted 41 percent to 448,000 units over the same period, <PERSON> Christie </PERSON> said. Housing starts reached their peak of the decade at 1.85 million units in 1986 before falling to 1.59 million in 1987 and 1.46 million in 1988. Apartment construction was stimulated beyond demand by tax incentives in the mid-1980s and vacancies remain high, <PERSON> Christie </PERSON> said. Construction of one-family houses has remained stable at 1 million to 1.1 million a year for the past three years, he said. This year, higher interest rates should hurt the single-family housing market more than the apartment market, he said. The <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> housing market was stimulated in 1988 by developers' rushing to beat no-growth initiatives on the state ballot, <PERSON> Christie </PERSON> said. The initiatives were defeated. Leading the nation in housing starts in the fourth quarter was the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles-Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> are, at 10,473 units, up 2 percent over the 1987 fourth quarter. Rounding out the top 10 were <LOCATION> Riverside-San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bernardino </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, 9,449, up 15 percent; <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, 9,316 units, down 3 percent; <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, 9,306, down 27 percent; <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, 6,072, down 1 percent; <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, 6,058, up 7 percent; <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION>, 5,469, up 115 percent; <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>, 5,467, down 19 percent; <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Palm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach-Boca </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Raton-Delray </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, 5,442, up 19 percent; and <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>, 5,134, down 2 percent. For 1988 as a whole, the top 10 were: <LOCATION> Riverside-San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bernardino </LOCATION>, 51,795, up 22 percent; <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, 49,300, down 10 percent; <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles-Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, 45,177, down 11 percent; <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, 42,386, down 8 percent; <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, 25,048, up 4 percent; <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, 24,830, down 17 percent; <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>, 24,147, down 5 percent; <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>, 22,823, up 7 percent; <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION>, 21,609, down 20 percent; and <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION>, 21,412, down 21 percent.

 Grain and soybean futures prices declined Monday at the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>, but analysts said supportive fundamentals helped temper losses. Farmer selling of corn and soybeans picked up steam over the weekend and helped pressure prices, said <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Lespinasse </PERSON>, a trader for <ORGANIZATION> Dean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Witter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reynolds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. Traders were further discouraged from buying by the notion that a selloff is due after the markets' strong gains last week, he said In the wheat pit, traders sold after a rumored sale of export bonus wheat to the Chinese on Friday failed to materialize. But anticipation that a deal with <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> still may be in the works, and expectations that the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> may make a bid on corn, helped curb the decline in those pits, <PERSON> Lespinasse </PERSON> said. Weather is playing a supporting role, and the slightest hint of another dry spring could send prices soaring, he said. `` All we need is a weather scare for the market to respond'' because of a lack of commodity reserves following last year's drought, <PERSON> Lespinasse </PERSON> said At the close, wheat was -LCB- cent to 3 cents lower with the contract for delivery in March at $ 4.32 -LCB- a bushel; corn was 1 -RCB- cents lower to -LCB- cent higher, with March at $ 2.69 -RCB- a bushel; oats were 3 \ cents to 6 -RCB- cents lower, with March at $ 1.99 -LCB- a bushel; and soybeans were 4 -LCB- cents lower to 1 -LCB- cents higher, with March at $ 7.56 -LCB- a bushel

Up to $ 50 million of the proceeds will be used to pay off long-term debts, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Shoe officials said. <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Capital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partners </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, an affiliate of <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Capital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Markets </ORGANIZATION>, is leading the investment group and has provided commitments for $ 160 million of equity and subordinated debt financing for the transaction, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Shoe said. <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Barach </PERSON>, chairman and chief executive officer of <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shoe </ORGANIZATION>, said the sale results from an overall review the company announced last August to explore ways it could increase corporate value to the shareholders. `` As part of this process, approximately 80 parties worldwide were contacted in an effort to solicit offers for all of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Shoe or for any of its businesses,'' he said. <PERSON> Barach </PERSON> said no prospective buyer wanted to acquire all of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Shoe or made an acceptable offer for the women's apparel division.

<HEAD>Japan to Change Monitoring Provision of Semiconductor Pact</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> has decided to alter its monitoring of overseas computer chip prices, one of the key provisions of a semiconductor agreement between it and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, an official said Monday. Under the pact, reached in 1985, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> pledged it would monitor the prices of Japanese memory chips sold in third countries as a means of discouraging their resale in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> at cheap prices. The agreement resulted from a series of complaints by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> semiconductor makers that Japanese companies had sold memory chips in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> below their fair market price, a practice known as dumping. The monitoring provision has been sharply criticized by <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> countries, which charged it regulated prices in other nations and therefore violated the rules of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, an international trade organization. In a ruling last March, the <ORGANIZATION> GATT </ORGANIZATION> said the European complaint was valid. `` The third-country monitoring is not consistent with the <ORGANIZATION> GATT </ORGANIZATION>, so we will have to modify the agreement,'' said <PERSON> Taizo </PERSON> <PERSON> Nakatomi </PERSON>, an official in the <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industry </ORGANIZATION>. He said a high ministry official, <PERSON> Tetsu </PERSON> <PERSON> Mizuno </PERSON>, left for <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> on Sunday to discuss a modification of the pact with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade officials. The <ORGANIZATION> Yomiuri </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shimbun </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s largest newspaper, reported that <PERSON> Mizuno </PERSON> will seek <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> consent to discontinue the third-country monitoring. But <PERSON> Nakatomi </PERSON> said <PERSON> Mizuno </PERSON> had no concrete position and would try to reach a compromise with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> on how to change the provision. `` Under the arrangement with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, we have an obligation to monitor prices and sales. But the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> is saying that we have to completely modify the provision. That's a dilemma for us,'' Nakatomi said. He said the Japanese government hoped to find a `` middle ground between the two extremes.'' In the bilateral semiconductor agreement, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> also pledged to set a `` fair price'' for exports of certain key memory chips to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, establish a `` supply and demand forecast committee'' intended to stabilize prices and supply of memory chips, and increase the sales of U.S.-made semiconductors in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. In April 1987, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> imposed $ 300 million in tariffs on <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> as a penalty for having allegedly violated the agreement by continuing to dump memory chips and reneging on the pledge to improve market access. Two months later, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> reduced the penalties by $ 135 million after ruling that Japanese makers had stopped dumping, leaving $ 165 million still in effect because of the market share issue. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> claims it has removed market restrictions and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> companies must try harder if they want to increase their sales in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. European countries are currently negotiating a separate semiconductor pact with <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> that would regulate prices of Japanese-made memory chips in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> but not in other nations, news reports say. The agreement also would not include any pledge by <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> to increase sales of European chips inside <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, the economic weekly <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION> reported.

<TEXT>
 Share prices on the <ORGANIZATION> London </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> fell substantially on Monday as dealers awaited January trade figures. Fears of higher interest rates contributed to the negative feeling, heightened by further steep declines in the British currency. Nervousness before Wednesday's trade report for January kept many institutional investors on the sidelines during Monday's session, dealers said. At the close the FT-SE 100-share index was down 22.8 points, or 1.12 percent at 1996.7. The late afternoon rally came as Wall Street moved slightly into positive territory after a weak start. The narrower <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> 30-share index was down 19.2 points at 1644.2. <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> 500 share index fell 11.9 points to 1,138.05. Trading activity was light. According to stock exchange figures, 413.8 million shares changed hands. But dealers said the figure was not representative, as new reporting rules that took effect Monday allowed market makers to report trades of more than 100,000 pounds on the following day.

 The dollar strengthened against all major currencies in moderate trading Monday after ending weaker overseas. Gold prices declined. <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> said gold was bid at $ 386.50 a troy ounce at 4 p.m. EST, down $ 2.50 from Friday's late bid. Currency dealers attributed the dollar's turnaround domestically to firmer short-term <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> interest rates, particularly the federal funds rates, the interest on overnight loans between banks. The fed funds rate was trading at 9 ~ percent, up from 913-16 percent Friday Short-term rates rose sharply on Friday as the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> raised its discount rate by a half percentage point to 7 percent due to concerns about inflation. Higher interest rates tend to support a currency. Also lending support to the dollar Monday was belief that the West German <ORGANIZATION> Bundesbank </ORGANIZATION> wo n't be raising its short-term interest rates when it meets on Thursday, explained <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> McGroarty </PERSON>, a vice president at <ORGANIZATION> Discount </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Speculation of such a hike had pushed the West German mark higher overseas at the expense of the British pound, traders said. In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, where trading ends before <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s business day begins, the dollar closed at 126.00 yen, down 0.29 yen from Thursday's close Japanese financial markets were closed Friday because of the state funeral of Emperor <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>. The dollar was quoted at 126.35 yen in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, and 126.78 yen in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, up from 126.125 yen late Friday. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, one British pound cost $ 1.7440, less expensive for buyers than $ 1.7520 late Friday.

<TEXT>
 After more than two months of negotiations, <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and federal securities regulators are nearing an agreement aimed at settling the largest Wall Street fraud case in history, sources said Monday. The sides are said to be still haggling over whether the investment firm must move part of its high-profile and big-money `` junk bond'' financing division run by trader <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Milken </PERSON> from <LOCATION> Beverly </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. But <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> has agreed to tighten internal controls to prevent future securities law violations, hire a consultant to monitor the changes and increase the size of its board, sources familiar with the negotiations said. <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> already has agreed to plead guilty to six felony counts and pay a record $ 650 million to settle criminal securities fraud charges with the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. But the plea deal can not proceed until the firm resolves civil claims brought last September by the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, the federal regulatory agency that polices <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> financial markets. The <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> accused <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> and four officials, including <PERSON> Milken </PERSON>, of insider trading, defrauding clients, securities fraud, stock manipulation and other violations in September. <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> have been negotiating regularly since December, when the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney's office in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> announced the criminal plea bargain that followed a massive two-year probe based on information supplied by imprisoned speculator <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON> <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> settlement, which sources said should be completed within two weeks, must be approved by a federal court judge. <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> then would enter a guilty plea to the felony counts and immediately fork over $ 300 million in fines to the government. Another $ 350 million would be placed in an account to cover potential lawsuits by investors. One source close to the negotiations, who asked not to be identified, said the sides were working on language and details of the agreement although the status of <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> division remained unresolved. The parties now apparently have agreed that <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> will move a portion of the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> business _ either its equity trading or convertible securities operations _ back to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, where the nation's fifth-largest securities firm is based, the source said. <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> opposed shifting the entire <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> operation, as the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> originally demanded. The operation has more than 500 employees and accounts for much of the firm's profits, and <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> argued that a relocation would cripple the company and severely hurt <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> financial markets. The firm reportedly has agreed to install an internal rules compliance system that will include tighter oversight of all operations, and add two to four people from outside the company to its 22-member board. The future of high-yield bond trader <PERSON> Milken </PERSON>, who organized the multibillion-dollar <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> operations in the late 1970s, has not played a role in the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> settlement negotiations, one source said. But <PERSON> Milken </PERSON> and potenial lawsuits against <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> could ensure that the landmark securities fraud case _ which the company says has cost it more than $ 175 million, including $ 30 million for photocopying legal documents _ will continue long after the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> settlement is signed and delivered. The government this week was expected to reply in court papers to a motion from <PERSON> Milken </PERSON> challenging the criminal settlement, which requires <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> to terminate <PERSON> Milken </PERSON> and withhold his multimillion-dollar pay. Even if his motion fails, <PERSON> Milken </PERSON>, who is expected to be indicted soon on fraud and racketeering charges but so far has not been charged in connection with the case, could sue <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> to get his 1988 pay, which his attorneys said would `` greatly exceed'' $ 100 million. <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> reportedly is setting aside the amount of <PERSON> Milken </PERSON>'s compensation, most of which is a bonus linked to performance, in case it later must pay him <PERSON> Milken </PERSON> has charged the settlement violates his rights. <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> also has established legal teams in several states and made contacts in others anticipating a barrage of lawsuits by state and local securities regulators and investors connected with deals named in the charges against <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION>. In addition, <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> will announce in about three weeks whether it is hiring former <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Shad </PERSON>, now the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassador to the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION>, as its new chairman, sources said. Earlier this year <PERSON> Shad </PERSON> confirmed he was considering a <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> offer.

<HEAD>Coastal Leaves $2.6 Billion Offer for Texas Eastern on Table</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Coastal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> said Monday its $ 2.6 billion cash offer for <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> will remain on the table pending the completion of a competing $ 3.2 billion tender offer for the company by <ORGANIZATION> Panhandle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. Coastal, however, said it does not intend to increase its $ 42-per-share offer to a level that would be competitive with <ORGANIZATION> Panhandle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s $ 53-per-share bid for 80 percent of the Houston-based natural gas company Coastal currently owns about 2.5 million of <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s 60.8 million common shares and said it may sell some or all of these holdings in the open market or in private transactions. Coastal's offer, which began Jan. 17, was extended last week and is scheduled to expire at midnight March 10. <ORGANIZATION> Panhandle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s offer expires at midnight March 20 Both are natural gas companies headquartered in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>. Coastal said in a statement that its intentions are based on information currently available to it and could change if it receives additional relevant information or as a result of its ongoing review of the situation. <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s board of directors rejected <ORGANIZATION> Coastal </ORGANIZATION>'s bid calling the offer inadequate. <ORGANIZATION> Panhandle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s deal, which the <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> board approved, called for the company to buy 80 percent of the company. Shares not purchased under the cash offer would be exchanged for <ORGANIZATION> Panhandle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> stock at the same $ 53 a share. The combination of <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Panhandle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> would create a 27,000-mile pipeline system, while <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eastern-Coastal </ORGANIZATION> merger would create a 30,000-mile network. Both would be the second-largest in total miles behind <ORGANIZATION> Enron </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, also of <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>, that has 38,000 miles of pipe.

 Stock prices turned mixed Monday and trading tailed off to its slowest pace in six weeks in the aftermath of the market's recent selloff. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which had fallen 79.28 points last week, recovered 4.82 to 2,250.36. But declining issues outnumbered advances by nearly 4 to 3 in nationwide trading of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> Exchange-listed stocks, with 606 up, 800 down and 521 unchanged. Volume on the floor of the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> came to 139.90 million shares, down from 160.68 million Friday and the lightest total since a 117.38 million-share day on Jan. 16. Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter market, totaled 167.66 million shares. The market's slide last week came amid signs of increasing inflation and upward pressure on interest rates. The bank prime lending rate rose for the second time this month, and the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> raised its discount rate. Analysts said that combination of events challenged widely held assumptions among investors that the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> had a strong hold in its effort to restrain inflation, and that interest rates were near a peak. Now, brokers said, many market participants are questioning how much higher inflation and interest rates might go, and what effects they might have on economic growth in the months ahead.

 Energy futures prices finished higher Monday but below the day's best levels as the recent rally began losing momentum. On the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, unleaded gasoline for March delivery rose 0.56 cent to end the day at 50.67 cents a gallon. March heating oil gained 0.92 cent to settle at 52.65 cents a gallon. `` The products did perform pretty well today,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Rowland </PERSON>, a trader at <ORGANIZATION> E.D. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> F. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Man </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Futures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. But he added, `` The markets are slowing down a little bit.'' He said the performance Monday largely reflected brokers buying before the March contracts expire on Tuesday. Crude oil prices also strengthened. The April contract for the benchmark <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> crude, West Texas Intermediate, gained 7 cents to finish at $ 18.14 a barrel. The temporary shutdown of a pumping station on the trans-Alaska oil pipeline, which halted the flow of oil in the line for several hours during the weekend, had little, if any, effect on crude prices, dealers said. One of three pumps at Pump Station One failed Saturday when snow got into its ventilation system, melted and caused an electrical short, said <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Alyeska </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pipeline </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co </ORGANIZATION>. The station's other two pumps failed that night when air intakes froze shut on their booster pumps, he said.

 Cotton futures prices surged Monday at the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cotton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, fueled by reports that <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> is halting all new export sales and by rumors of purchases by <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. On other markets, declines were posted in grains, soybeans, precious metals and cattle prices, while hog prices were mostly lower and pork bellies were mostly higher. Oil prices were mixed. News out of <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, a leading cotton producer and exporter behind <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, was the major factor in the cotton pit, said <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Whitten </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York-based </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Balfour </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Maclaine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> `` <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> has issued an edict to not allow any more exports,'' he said, adding that it is unclear if the move is temporary or permanent. The measure affects new sales, and `` is indicative of a fact that the world is running out of extra cotton for export,'' <PERSON> Whitten </PERSON> said. `` If there are any buyers ... they will have to come to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. If they come to us, they'll have to pay our price.'' Rumors of Chinese purchases of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> cotton also supported prices, he said. Cotton prices settled .67 cent to 1.60 cents higher, with the contract for delivery in March at 59.19 cents a pound. Grain and soybean futures prices dipped at the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>, but analysts said supportive fundamentals helped temper losses. Farmer selling of corn and soybeans increased slightly over the weekend and helped pressure prices, said <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Lespinasse </PERSON>, a trader for <ORGANIZATION> Dean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Witter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reynolds </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. Buying was further discouraged by the notion that a selloff is due after the markets' strong gains last week, he said. In the wheat pit, traders sold after a rumored sale of export bonus wheat to the Chinese on Friday failed to materialize. But anticipation that a deal with <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> still may be on tap, and expectations that the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> may make a bid on corn helped curb the decline in those pits, <PERSON> Lespinasse </PERSON> said. Wheat prices settled -LCB- cent to 2 -LCB- cents lower, with the contract for delivery in March at $ 4.32 -LCB- a bushel; corn settled 1 -LCB- cents lower to -LCB- cent higher, with the March contract at $ 2.70 a bushel; oats were 3 \ cents to 7 cents lower, with March at $ 1.99 \ a bushel; and soybeans were 3 -RCB- cents lower to 1 -RCB- cents higher, with March at $ 7.57 \ Credit-tightening by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> late last week, indicative of its `` commitment to an anti-inflationary stance,'' continued to pressure gold and silver prices at the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Anagnos </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Thomson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> McKinnon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> on Friday raised its discount rate, the loan fee it charges to member banks, from 6.5 percent to 7 percent, in a move designed to curb inflation by slowing down the economy. `` It's not an environment where investors are actively seeking to add to their portfolio of precious metals,'' <PERSON> Anagnos </PERSON> said. Gold prices settled $ 2.80 to $ 3 lower, with the contract for delivery in March at $ 387.30 a troy ounce; silver prices were 4.7 cents to 8 cents lower, with March at $ 5.85 a troy ounce. Cattle prices dipped, hog prices were mostly lower and pork bellies were mostly higher in lackluster trading at the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. Pork belly prices remained firm despite the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s monthly cold storage report, released after the close of trading Friday, indicating frozen pork belly supplies were slightly greater than had been expected. Anticipation of the report sparked a selloff Friday, which in turn encouraged short-covering Monday, analysts said. Live cattle settled unchanged to .40 cent lower, with the contract for delivery in April at 78.15 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .27 cent to .70 cent lower, with the March contract at 82.92 cents a pound; live hogs were .20 cent lower to .05 cent higher, with April at 43.47 cents a pound; and pork bellies settled .18 cent lower to 1.12 cents higher, with March at 37.82 cents a pound. Crude oil prices were mixed in trading at the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. Crude oil settled 13 cents lower to 7 cents higher, with the contract for delivery in April at $ 18.14 a barrel; heating oil was .22 cent lower to .92 cent higher, with March at 52.65 cents a gallon; unleaded gas was .20 cent lower to .56 cent higher, with March at 50.67 cents a gallon.

<HEAD>More Foreign Steel Dumping without Restraints, Executive Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FREDERICK STANDISH</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Foreign companies are ready to resume large-scale steel dumping on the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> if voluntary restraints on the amount of imported steel are not continued this fall, the president of the USS Division of <ORGANIZATION> USX </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> said Monday. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> said a 5-year renewal of the limits, wich expire Sept. 30, is essential for the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> steel industry to continue its 2-year financial comeback. `` We ca n't afford to become giddy,'' he said. `` Two years of profitability does n't offset five years of losses.'' <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> steel industry earned more than $ 2 billion in 1988 and about $ 900 million the year before. But between 1982 and 1986, the industry lost $ 12 billion, an average of $ 2.4 billion annually. The voluntary restraint agreement, which began in 1984, limits the amount of imported finished steel to 18.5 percent of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> market, among other things. The <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Imported </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steel </ORGANIZATION> said steel made overseas and shipped to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> accounts for about 17.7 percent of the market, below the current <ORGANIZATION> VRA </ORGANIZATION> limit. Despite that, <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> said, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government must hold the line on the amount of steel coming into the country. `` There's no doubt that foreign producers will revert to large-scale dumping of heavily subsidized steel'' without a <ORGANIZATION> VRA </ORGANIZATION> renewal, he said. `` We certainly ca n't tolerate a return to past practices.'' In the third quarter of 1984, shortly before the <ORGANIZATION> VRA </ORGANIZATION> began, imported steel made up just more than 30 percent of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> market. <PERSON> Graham </PERSON>'s comments came during the opening day of the week-long annual congress of the <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Automotive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineers </ORGANIZATION>. The imported steel association, which supports an elimination of the <ORGANIZATION> VRA </ORGANIZATION> or a 2-year extension instead of five years, has claimed that the limits reduce supply thereby increasing prices for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> steel, something the domestic steelmakers like. But <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> dismissed that contention. `` It's not an issue of protectionism,'' he said. `` It's an issue of legal trading practices.'' <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> also said Pittsburgh-based USS is prepared to file legal papers if the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration rejects a VRA extension. `` We need enabling legislation from <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> before the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration has the ability to act,'' he said. `` We see ourselves as prudent businessmen.'' He declined to say when any legal moves may be taken, adding that an earlier agreement barred the industry from filing trade litigation while a <ORGANIZATION> VRA </ORGANIZATION> was in effect.

 A group led by Malaysian investor <PERSON> Vincent </PERSON> <PERSON> Tan </PERSON> on Monday announced a $ 33-a-share tender offer for <ORGANIZATION> SSMC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, the Shelton Conn.-based maker of Singer sewing machines.

<HEAD>National Sells Unit to Hitachi-GM For $398 Million</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Semiconductor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> said Monday it is selling its mainframe computer business to <ORGANIZATION> Hitachi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION> and a unit of <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> for $ 398 million, a deal one analyst called `` a great move'' for National. In announcing the sale, the chip maker said it broke off a tentative agreement with a Dutch company, <ORGANIZATION> Memorex </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telex </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> NV </ORGANIZATION>, for half of <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advanced </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Hitachi </ORGANIZATION>, which will own 80 percent of the joint venture that is buying <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advanced </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION>, will gain a greater presence in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> mainframe market dominated by <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, analysts said. <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advanced </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION> sells <ORGANIZATION> Hitachi </ORGANIZATION>'s mainframe computers and data-storage systems. The deal will tighten that relationship and allow <PERSON> Hitachi </PERSON> greater flexibility in building the $ 900 million-a-year business. The <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> unit, Dallas-based <ORGANIZATION> Electronic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, also is expected to become a stronger competitor to <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Digital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Equipment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> in helping companies assemble computer systems. `` From National's standpoint, it's a very positive move,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> McManus </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Thomas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> McKinnon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` They get all the money up front. I think it's a great move.'' <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Hammons </PERSON>, a computer industry analyst with the <ORGANIZATION> Sierra </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Tempe </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ariz. </LOCATION>, also said the deal was good for <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Semiconductor </ORGANIZATION> but wondered what it would do with all the money. `` National could n't do anything with <ORGANIZATION> NAS </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Hammons </PERSON> said. `` So now that they've gotten rid of it, the question is what are they going to do with the cash that they could n't do with the company?'' National Semiconductor spokeswoman <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Coady </PERSON> said the money would go toward the retirement of debt and working capital. National Semiconductor announced on Jan. 9 that it had signed a letter of intent to sell a half-interest in <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advanced </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION> to <ORGANIZATION> Memorex </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telex </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> NV </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Amsterdam </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION>, for $ 250 million and 4 million shares of <ORGANIZATION> Memorex </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telex </ORGANIZATION> stock. National Semiconductor would have continued to own the rest. Complications in financing the deal arose and the letter of intent expired earlier this month, freeing National Semiconductor to consider other offers, said <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bragg </PERSON>, a spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> Memorex </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telex </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> subsidiary in <LOCATION> Tulsa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Okla </LOCATION>. Under the new deal, which is also subject to a definitive agreement, <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advanced </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION> is to be bought by a joint-venture company created by <ORGANIZATION> Hitachi </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION>'s EDS unit. <ORGANIZATION> Hitachi </ORGANIZATION> will own 80 percent of the company and <ORGANIZATION> EDS </ORGANIZATION> will own 20 percent, <ORGANIZATION> Hitachi </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Osamu </PERSON> <PERSON> Naito </PERSON> said. He said the partners will in turn sell the European portion of the business, which accounts for less than half its revenue, to <ORGANIZATION> Comparex </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> GmbH </ORGANIZATION> for an undisclosed price. <ORGANIZATION> Comparex </ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION> Mannheim </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, is <ORGANIZATION> Hitachi </ORGANIZATION>'s other sales outlet for mainframe computers in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Naito </PERSON> said. National Semiconductor has been selling off businesses to raise cash to build up its core business of computer chips, which has been losing money. The financing problem that spoiled the deal with the Dutch company came when there was more difficulty than expected in having <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advanced </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION> raise $ 250 million in cash, which would have been paid to National Semiconductor, <PERSON> Bragg </PERSON> said. He said <PERSON> Memorex </PERSON> <PERSON> Telex </PERSON> proposed other deals but could not match the all-cash offer from <ORGANIZATION> Hitachi </ORGANIZATION> and EDS. National Advanced Systems is <ORGANIZATION> Hitachi </ORGANIZATION>'s largest distributor of mainframe computers that run the same programs as <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION>'s big mainframes. It has 2,200 employees worldwide, including 1,200 in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` We think it's a good situation for us,'' said <PERSON> Coady </PERSON>. `` I just want to make it clear that we did not accept the <ORGANIZATION> Hitachi </ORGANIZATION> deal because we thought it was a better deal, in a vaccuum. We continued to negotiate with <ORGANIZATION> Memorex </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telex </ORGANIZATION> well after the letter of intent had expired.'' A definitive agreement is expected by the end of March and the deal should be closed by the end of April, <PERSON> Coady </PERSON> said. National Semiconductor then would be pared down to about 35,000 employees worldwide. The company announced 2,000 layoffs earlier this year.

<HEAD>Appeals Court Upholds Corning Glass Fiber Patents</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CORNING, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A federal appeals court Monday upheld a judgment against <ORGANIZATION> Sumitomo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>, which was found to have infringed on two Corning Glass Works patents dealing with optical fibers. The ruling by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> affirms an October 1987 decision by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Conner </PERSON>, who decided all Sumitomo optical-waveguide fibers made or sold in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> infringed on one or the other of two Corning patents. Payment of damages and other relief to <PERSON> Corning </PERSON> will be determined in a separate proceeding by the district court. Optical fibers are hair-thin strands of glass used to transmit information by light. They are used extensively in long-distance telephone lines. `` We believe this confirms the significance of the contribution that <PERSON> Corning </PERSON> has made to this technology,'' said <PERSON> Corning </PERSON>'s <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Suwinski </PERSON>. `` Furthermore, the decision should be well-received by every company that invests to create new technology.'' <ORGANIZATION> Sumitomo </ORGANIZATION> vice president <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Swirbul </PERSON> said the decision in the appeal was disappointing to the company and `` different from our expectations.'' The company has been prohibited since 1987 from manufacturing or selling optical fiber strands but is allowed to sell fiber optic cable, which contains many strands, <PERSON> Swirbul </PERSON> said. As such, he said, `` our current activities in our -LRB- fiber-optic -RRB- division ... will not be affected'' by the judgment. <ORGANIZATION> Sumitomo </ORGANIZATION>'s fiber-optic operations, which accounted for about 10 percent of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> demand in 1987, are located in Research Triangle Park, <LOCATION> N.C </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 A stockbroker testified in the <ORGANIZATION> GAF </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> securities fraud trial Monday that he tried to fix the price of a company stock, but contradicted a key government informant who said the broker took some orders directly from <ORGANIZATION> GAF </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Melton </PERSON>, head trader for <ORGANIZATION> Jefferies </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, took the stand in the first Wall Street fraud case to be heard by a jury, one month after suffering a heart attack in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> that delayed his testimony. <PERSON> Melton </PERSON>, 45, backed up the account of trader <PERSON> Boyd </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jefferies </PERSON>, who said in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> earlier this month that <ORGANIZATION> GAF </ORGANIZATION> asked him to inflate the stock price of <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carbide </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> to $ 22 a share in October 1986. But under cross-examination, <PERSON> Melton </PERSON> contradicted <PERSON> Jefferies </PERSON>' testimony that <PERSON> Melton </PERSON> pursued Carbide stock in early November 1986 under orders from <ORGANIZATION> GAF </ORGANIZATION> Vice Chairman <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sherwin </PERSON>, who was indicted along with the company last July `` I do n't recall Mr. <PERSON> Sherwin </PERSON> ever telling me to do anything with Union Carbide,'' <PERSON> Melton </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Jefferies </PERSON> had testified that his firm bought 190,000 <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carbide </ORGANIZATION> shares at <ORGANIZATION> Sherwin </ORGANIZATION>'s request in two days in October as part of the scheme. The purpose of the alleged stock manipulation was to maximize <ORGANIZATION> GAF </ORGANIZATION>'s gain from the sale of its holding in <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carbide </ORGANIZATION> after a failed takeover attempt of the much larger chemical company. <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON>, N.J.-based <ORGANIZATION> GAF </ORGANIZATION> sold about 5 million Carbide shares in November 1986 for $ 23 each. <PERSON> Melton </PERSON> said <PERSON> Jefferies </PERSON> ordered him to buy <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carbide </ORGANIZATION> stock through the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> and keep it at a certain price, and to report directly to <PERSON> Sherwin </PERSON> each day he traded the stock. He said some days he also bought stock through exchanges in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> to support prices in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` My mission was to close the stock at 22 -LRB- dollars -RRB- or higher,'' <PERSON> Melton </PERSON> testified under questioning from Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Loewenson </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr </PERSON>. He said he sometimes bought `` everything for sale.'' `` I told Mr. <PERSON> Sherwin </PERSON> what I had done and the price -LRB- at which -RRB- it had closed,'' <PERSON> Melton </PERSON> said. `` He said, ` Thank you.''' The trial is in its second incarnation. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> <PERSON> Lowe </PERSON> ordered a mistrial on Jan. 10 four weeks into the case after concluding prosecutors withheld a key piece of evidence from the defense. <PERSON> Jefferies </PERSON> struck a plea bargain with government prosecutors in 1987 after he was implicated in the Wall Street insider trading scandals with jailed speculator <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON> <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON>. <PERSON> Jefferies </PERSON> agreed to plea guilty to two securities law violations, quit his brokerage firm and stay out of the securities business for at least five years. He has n't been sentenced.

<HEAD>Empire Seeks Nearly $1 Billion From FSLIC In Recapitalization Plan</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DARREN DOPP</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Federal regulators would contribute $ 905 million to Empire of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s recapitalization under a proposal made by the troubled thrift Monday. The application to the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> is a first of its kind, but industry observers said others will follow. `` We've been predicting this would happen for some time,'' said <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Faucette </PERSON>, an attorney for a coalition of banking interests. `` Unless executives are totally asleep at the helm, they'll all be doing this.'' If the request was approved by the <ORGANIZATION> FSLIC </ORGANIZATION>, the bank said it would be able to raise an additional $ 670 million through private investors and could return immediately to profitability. The recapitalization plan `` demonstrates a means whereby the cost to taxpayers of the resolution of the entire thrift crisis could be significantly reduced,'' Empire Chairman <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Willax </PERSON> said. Empire, the nation's 12th-largest thrift with $ 11.3 billion in assets, is asking the <ORGANIZATION> FSLIC </ORGANIZATION> for the cash as a replacement for non-cash assistance the <ORGANIZATION> FSLIC </ORGANIZATION> gave Empire when it took over 13 failing savings and loans from 1981 to 1986. Although the bank is currently solvent, officials are afraid that federal proposals to save the thrift industry will reduce the value of its non-cash assistance. If that happened Empire would have difficulty raising money to meet new capital requirements. `` This is not at all an act of desperation but rather an act of anticipation,'' <PERSON> Willax </PERSON> said. The proposal shows the investment community still has confidence in Empire, he said. <PERSON> Willax </PERSON> said the $ 670 million commitment of <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> investment firm, is the largest amount of private money involved in the recapitalization of any thrift. In a statement issued by <PERSON> Drexel </PERSON> <PERSON> Burnam </PERSON>, senior vice president <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> called the Empire proposal `` an exciting, innovative effort that will result in a strengthened institution.'' <PERSON> Faucette </PERSON>, an attorney for <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assistance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inequity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Drexel </PERSON> <PERSON> Burnam </PERSON>'s involvement was an indication that the financial community has doubts about government proposals to help the thrift industry. `` The feeling is that the government has gone and changed the rules for insititutions like Empire and that this sort of thing -LRB- the Empire plan -RRB- may be the only way out,'' he said. <PERSON> Faucette </PERSON> said, however, he doubted the federal officials would approve of the idea. `` You can imagine the type of reception you'd get when you ask for nearly a billion dollars,'' he said.

The inquest comes after several <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> congressmen pressed the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> to step up enforcement of margin requirements, passed after the 1929 stock market crash to limit borrowing for speculative purposes. `` We've had informal, cordial and cooperative discussions with <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> staff,'' MAI Basic spokesman <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosenthal </PERSON> said in a statement. `` We've answered all of the questions they've asked of us. And as we previously stated in our offering documents, we believe our offer complies with all margin rules.'' The <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> declined to comment on whether it was conducting a preliminary inquiry or a full-scale investigation. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, an aide to Sen. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, D-Mass., said the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> began interviewing MAI officials last week `` What I know is that there is an inquiry going on,'' he said. `` How intensive, I could n't tell you.'' MAI Basic, a <LOCATION> Tustin </LOCATION>, Calif.-based computer firm controlled by <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> investor <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> LeBow </PERSON>, has offered $ 20 per share for Prime, a much larger computer maker headquartered in <LOCATION> Natick </LOCATION>. In court documents, <ORGANIZATION> MAI </ORGANIZATION> said it would finance the takeover with an $ 875 million corporate borrowing and $ 650 million in secured loans. Under the margin rules, at least 50 percent of the $ 650 million must be secured by collateral, such as cash, tangible assets or stock. `` They have put up stock, but the question is, what is the actual value of the stock, and is it really secured by assets of MAI,'' said <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Homonoff </PERSON>, an aide to Rep. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Markey </PERSON>, D-Mass. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Mazzone </PERSON> temporarily enjoined MAI's bid last month, ruling that the firm had not adequately disclosed its financial arrangements with the investment firm <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. A hearing in the case is scheduled Thursday at the 1st <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Mazzone </PERSON> late last year said MAI's bid raised serious questions about compliance with margin requirements. Following the judge's comments, <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>, <PERSON> Markey </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> wrote letters to the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> urging stiffer application of the margin rules in takeover battles Aides to the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> congressmen said that despite the boom in highly leveraged corporate takeovers, the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> has not brought an enforcement action on margin rules recently.

 The state's vegetable farmers surveyed heavy losses in tomato, cucumber and potato crops Monday after a record-setting cold snap, but an industry official predicted shoppers will not face shortages. <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Crain </PERSON>, marketing-production manager for the <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fruit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Vegetable </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, predicted that supermarket consumers would see little loss of volume in popular vegetables such as lettuce and tomatoes despite damage to winter and early spring crops. `` We still have plenty of product. We're still in the market,'' <PERSON> Crain </PERSON> said. Just north of the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> border, <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> peach growers reported more than $ 9 million in losses from the cold. However, <PERSON> Tommy </PERSON> <PERSON> Irvin </PERSON>, commissioner of the <ORGANIZATION> Georgia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION>, said, `` It seems right now we did n't come out hardly as bad as we first appeared.'' <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s $ 1.3 billion citrus crop reportedly came through the frosty weather Thursday, Friday and Saturday nearly unscathed. The temperatures did not stay low enough long enough to affect fruit on the trees. Citrus industry officials said it would be about two weeks before they determine how the damage to early blooms and new growth would affect next year's crop. But the state's $ 1.1 billion vegetable industry did not fare as well. With vegetable losses undetermined, most industry leaders said it was too early to tell what effect the freezing temperatures Thursday through Saturday might have on consumer prices. `` There would have to be vast losses in all sectors before any real impact is made at the retail level,'' Agriculture Commissioner <PERSON> Doyle </PERSON> <PERSON> Conner </PERSON> said. Officials estimated the tomato crops were the hardest hit, with half of the crop wiped out in the <LOCATION> Ruskin-Palmetto </LOCATION> area around <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Petersburg </LOCATION>, 25 percent to 35 percent of the crop lost in southwest <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> around <LOCATION> Naples </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Immokalee </LOCATION> and 10 percent of the crop damaged in south <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> around <LOCATION> Homestead </LOCATION>. Tomatoes are the state's largest produce crop, valued at almost $ 490 million in 1987, the latest figures available from the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION>. About 70 percent of the cucumbers were reported damaged, and production was set back until May for most of the crop, which is grown primarily in the southern part of the state at this time of year. Spring potatoes in the Palatka-St. <LOCATION> Augustine </LOCATION> area in north-central <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> were heavily damaged There was lesser damage to corn, peppers, squash, watermelons and leafy vegetables, mainly in north and central <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. Crops along the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> were not badly affected. `` I just see a crazy, mixed-up spring marketing,'' <PERSON> Crain </PERSON> said. `` With replanting, everything -LRB- production -RRB- is being pushed back. And with the weather moderating in the spring, we're going to see a lot of crops overlapping.'' Some of <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s traditional late-winter crops also will be overlapping with the same varieties from southeastern states, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Southwest </LOCATION> in April, May and June, he said. <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, which is a major competitor in tomatoes, peppers, cucumbers, squash and eggplant, was hit hard by freezing temperatures in January and its production is also way down.

<TEXT>
 The board of directors of <ORGANIZATION> Morton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Thiokol </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> on Monday authorized management to proceed with a plan for a tax-free spin-off of the company's commercial operations, officials said. The action will create a new company, <ORGANIZATION> Morton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, consisting of specialty chemicals, air bag manufacturing and salt businesses. The aerospace business, which manufactures the space shuttle booster motor and strategic and tactical propulsion systems, will continue to operate within the existing corporate entity, which will be renamed <ORGANIZATION> Thiokol </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. The transaction is expected to be finalized July 1, subject to an <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> ruling that it is tax-free and to the approval of stockholders, said company spokesman <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Russell </PERSON>. <PERSON> Morton </PERSON> <PERSON> Thiokol </PERSON> stockholders will receive a share-for-share distribution of <ORGANIZATION> Morton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> stock, <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> said. Management believes the stock of both companies will qualify for listing on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. The board will establish record and payment dates for the stock distribution later. `` This move separates two businesses with distinct financial, investment and operating characteristics so that each can adopt strategies and pursue objectives appropriate to its specific businesses,'' said <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Locke </PERSON>, <PERSON> Morton </PERSON> <PERSON> Thiokol </PERSON>'s chairman and chief executive officer. `` The transaction will allow investors to evaluate better the individual businesses and their future outlook, enhancing the likelihood that the true value of each business will be properly reflected,'' he said. <PERSON> Locke </PERSON> said the combined market values of the stocks of the two companies may exceed the recent market value of <ORGANIZATION> Morton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Thiokol </ORGANIZATION> stock. <ORGANIZATION> Morton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Thiokol </ORGANIZATION> stock closed Monday at $ 40 in consolidated <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> trading, unchanged from Friday's close. <PERSON> Locke </PERSON> said the combination of the specialty chemicals, inflatable restraint systems, or air bags, and salt businesses will create a company with fiscal year 1989 sales approaching $ 1.5 billion, assets of $ 1.4 billion and over 8,000 employees. It is expected that <PERSON> Locke </PERSON> and <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON>, president and chief operating officer of <ORGANIZATION> Morton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Thiokol </ORGANIZATION>, will be elected to those posts at <ORGANIZATION> Morton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Locke </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Thiokol </ORGANIZATION> will be a company with approximately $ 1.1 billion in sales, assets of $ 800 million and more than 12,000 employees. <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Garrison </PERSON>, group vice president for aerospace in <LOCATION> Ogden </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>, is expected to be elected president and chief operating officer, while a search for a chairman and chief executive officer is anticipated. <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> said the action had nothing to do with the aerospace group's $ 500 million redesign of the space shuttle booster in the wake of the 1986 Challenger explosion. The redesigned booster, which corrected joint problems blamed for the blast, has been used successfully on two shuttle flights in recent months and will be used on several more. `` The shuttle program is in very good shape, we're very confident of redesign,'' <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> said. He said the Chicago-based company was preparing to bid on a $ 2 billion-plus contract for 66 new flights sets of two boosters each and 10 development motors. The company said that under the spin off, the combined dividends initially paid by the two companies will equal the current <ORGANIZATION> Morton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Thiokol </ORGANIZATION> dividend. The company plans to redeem its 8 ~ percent debentures due in 1995 and 9 | percent debentures due in 2000 prior to June 30, Although the business momentum and profitability outlook for <ORGANIZATION> Morton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Thiokol </ORGANIZATION> is unchanged from a previous projection of an earnings-per-share increase to a range of $ 3.40 to $ 3.60 for the fiscal year ending June 30, the company expects that significant special charges associated with the spinoff will reduce profit below that range. Since the operating results of <ORGANIZATION> Morton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Thiokol </ORGANIZATION> will be reported separately for the quarter and fiscal year ending June 30, no revised projection is being made for <ORGANIZATION> Morton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Thiokol </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>Intel Introduces `Supercomputer On A Chip'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SANTA CLARA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A `` supercomputer on a chip'' hailed by engineers as a technological marvel because it can be used as the basis for a new generation of high-speed computers was formally unveiled Monday by <ORGANIZATION> Intel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. The i860 chip was touted at the company's headquarters as the first 64-bit microprocessor capable of performing operations typically associated only with supercomputing systems and three-dimensional graphics workstations. The chip is crammed with more than a million transistors, nearly four times the number found on current microprocessors. `` The level of integration and performance -LRB- the i860 -RRB- provides puts supercomputing power in the hands of virtually anyone who can afford a desktop computer,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> House </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Intel </ORGANIZATION> senior vice president and general manager of its microcomputer components group. <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and Ing. <ORGANIZATION> Olivetti </ORGANIZATION> are among 50 companies that have made commitments to use the i860, said <PERSON> Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Leglise </PERSON>, marketing manager for <ORGANIZATION> Intel </ORGANIZATION>'s microprocessor division. The chip performs up to 80 million calculations per second and is priced at $ 750. It operates on instructions that are as long as those used in mainframe and supercomputers. <ORGANIZATION> Intel </ORGANIZATION> last month said it would make the i860, which it initially called the N-10, available as a helper chip as well as making it available to other companies as a central processor for engineering and graphics workstations and multi-user computers. As a helper chip, the i860 could handle the `` grunt work'' of high-speed, repetitive calculations while a computer's main processor handles more complex tasks. That's a bold decision because it pits the chip against established chips made by competititors such as <ORGANIZATION> Sun </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Microsystems </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Mips </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Computers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Motorola </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Intel </ORGANIZATION> said the chip will be available by the third quarter of 1989 The i860 is built with so-called RISC technology, for reduced instruction set computing. That means it can not be used as a plug-in replacement for the microprocessors used in industry-standard personal computers. `` Getting <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> as a user is an important feather in their cap,'' said <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Klesken </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Montgomery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. `` The RISC battle is heating up.'' RISC is important because it represents leading-edge semiconductor technology, which is used in computer workstations, the fastest growing segment of the computer business. Workstations are free-standing computers. <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> will use the i860 in an add-on board for its latest personal computer line, called Micro Channel, while <ORGANIZATION> Olivetti </ORGANIZATION> plans to make the chip the centerpiece of a new line of minicomputers. <ORGANIZATION> Motorola </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday plans to unveil its first computer systems using its own RISC chips. The systems, the Delta Series 8000, are based on <ORGANIZATION> Motorola </ORGANIZATION>'s 88000 RISC processor and offer performance that ranges from 17 million to 60 million instructions per second. <ORGANIZATION> Intel </ORGANIZATION> said the i860 is ideal for computation-intensive applications and those requiring the interactive display of three-dimensional images, such as fluid dynamics, molecular modeling, structural analysis and econometric modeling. The company said general business applications also will benefit because of the incomparable performance. `` Until today, users basically had three choices if they wanted to perform these applications efficiently: They could share time on a multimillion-dollar supercomputer, if they could gain access to one; they could share time on a $ 500,000 minisupercomputer; or they could use a less powerful, but more interactive $ 100,000 graphics supercomputer,'' <PERSON> House </PERSON> said in a statement. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> continues to dominate in processor chips _ the brains of computers _ even though <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> has taken over most of the work market for memory chips. On Feb. 14, <ORGANIZATION> NEC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Hitachi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION> both announced high-speed microprocessors that they said were the fastest of their kind. <ORGANIZATION> Hitachi </ORGANIZATION>'s runs at up to 70 million instructions per second. The company did not describe at the time what the chip could be used for. <ORGANIZATION> NEC </ORGANIZATION>'s V-70 runs at 10 million to 20 million instructions per second and its V-80 runs at 15 million to 22 million instructions per second. Those chips are mainly for telecommunications.

 A federal judge has overturned a <ORGANIZATION> Scripps </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Clinic </ORGANIZATION> patent on an anti-bleeding substance for hemophiliacs, allowing rival firms to continue work on their own versions of the potentially lucrative product. The ruling by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Schwarzer </PERSON>, made public Monday, was a victory for the biotechnology company <ORGANIZATION> Genentech </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and the license-holder of its patent, <ORGANIZATION> Miles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratories </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, which otherwise could have been forbidden from further work and possibly required to pay damages. `` This does a great deal to lift the clouds of uncertainty in an area that's previously been uncertain,'' said <PERSON> Bud </PERSON> <PERSON> Modersbach </PERSON>, a lawyer for Cutter Biological, a division of Miles. Cutter has begun human clinical trials of a version of the substance produced through gene-splicing but has not obtained federal approval to market it. <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> Moroz </PERSON>, a lawyer for <ORGANIZATION> Scripps </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Clinic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>, said the company disagreed with the ruling and was hopeful of a reversal by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> for the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION>. The ruling does not prevent the <ORGANIZATION> Rorer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, which is licensed to use the Scripps patent, from continuing to sell a blood-clotting product called Monoclate. But if the decision is upheld, it will prevent Rorer from dominating `` a very large market,'' said <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Raines </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Genentech </ORGANIZATION>'s vice president for patents. The substance is an artificial form of a clotting protein called Human Factor VIII, found in healthy people but missing in hemophiliacs. <ORGANIZATION> Scripps </ORGANIZATION>' version of the purified protein, made from human and pig blood plasma, received a patent in 1982 and an updated patent in 1984. <ORGANIZATION> Genentech </ORGANIZATION>, using different technology, produced a similar protein in 1984 <PERSON> Schwarzer </PERSON> ruled in 1987 that <ORGANIZATION> Genentech </ORGANIZATION> had violated <ORGANIZATION> Scripps </ORGANIZATION>' patent, but he refused to halt work by <ORGANIZATION> Genentech </ORGANIZATION> The judge said hemophiliacs could suffer if development of the product was hampered, and also noted <ORGANIZATION> Genentech </ORGANIZATION>'s challenge to the validity of <ORGANIZATION> Scripps </ORGANIZATION>' patent. In his latest ruling, <PERSON> Schwarzer </PERSON> found: _ <ORGANIZATION> Scripps </ORGANIZATION>' patent did not describe, or adequately identify, the particular substance or antibody that would make the substance work _ The updating of the patent by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Patent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> in 1985 was based on <ORGANIZATION> Scripps </ORGANIZATION>' claim that its 1982 patent application contained inadvertent errors <PERSON> Schwarzer </PERSON> said the claim of error, which is required for expansion of a patent, were `` incredible'' coming from experienced patent lawyers. _ <ORGANIZATION> Scripps </ORGANIZATION> was guilty of `` inequitable conduct'' for submitting patent claims based on a purified product when one of its samples contained 50 percent contamination _ A 1979 doctoral thesis by a student researcher had publicly revealed the process of producing a clotting product with the same potency as the Scripps patent That finding would invalidate several aspects of the patent.
