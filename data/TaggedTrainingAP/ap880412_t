 A Guyanese immigrant convicted of killing his girlfriend and four members of her family in a jealous rage lost appeals Tuesday in state and federal courts in his last-minute bid to avoid the electric chair. The <ORGANIZATION> Louisiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> and then <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Beer </PERSON> refused to put off the execution of <PERSON> Leslie </PERSON> <PERSON> Lowenfield </PERSON>, 34, which is set for early Wednesday. <PERSON> Lowenfield </PERSON>'s attorneys then went to the 5th <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> with the plea that he is mentally ill and therefore unable to understand the death penalty. At the <ORGANIZATION> Louisiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Penitentiary </ORGANIZATION>, Warden <PERSON> Hilton </PERSON> <PERSON> Butler </PERSON> said <PERSON> Lowenfield </PERSON> was still hoping for a fifth delay of as many execution dates. <PERSON> Butler </PERSON> said <PERSON> Lowenfield </PERSON> spurned the condemned's customary last meal and spent the evening with <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, the head basketball coach from <ORGANIZATION> Louisiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, widely recognized as a motivational speaker, had been corresponding with <PERSON> Lowenfield </PERSON> since he took the <ORGANIZATION> LSU </ORGANIZATION> team on a tour of <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>'s death row in 1984, <PERSON> Butler </PERSON> said. A Catholic priest and nun also were with <PERSON> Lowenfield </PERSON>, the warden said. <PERSON> Lowenfield </PERSON>, a welder from <LOCATION> Guyana </LOCATION> who came to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in 1981 on a work permit, was convicted in 1984 in the August 1982 slayings of his estranged girlfriend, who was a <ORGANIZATION> Jefferson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parish </ORGANIZATION> sheriff's deputy, and four others. The case has already been appealed unsuccessfully to both the state's highest court and the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. Lawyers based their latest appeal on a recent psychological study that found the prisoner to be a paranoid schizophrenic. `` There is a serious question about <PERSON> Leslie </PERSON>'s competency to be executed due to his mental illness,'' said <PERSON> Judith </PERSON> <PERSON> Menadue </PERSON>, attorney for the <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> Capital Defense Project. She said the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> has ruled that people who can not understand what it means to be executed may not be put to death. Before the trial, <PERSON> Lowenfield </PERSON> was found competent, and he refused to allow his lawyers to use insanity as a defense, insisting instead that he was in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> at the time the family was killed. But no witnesses backed up his story of being out of state. The denial of the stay was issued without further comment from the state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> majority, but the one member who backed the appeal issued a brief dissent. `` The clinical psychologist who spent five hours with the defendant concluded: ` Lowenfield indicated that he is currently unable to understand the death penalty,''' Justice <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON> wrote. He noted that criminal law calls for halting prosecution when there are reasonable grounds to doubt a defendant's sanity, and for going ahead after that only when the defendant is found to have the mental capacity to do so. Prosecutors said <PERSON> Lowenfield </PERSON> barged into his girlfriend's house in <LOCATION> Marrero </LOCATION>, a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> suburb, and shot everybody there. The victims were the girlfriend, <PERSON> Sheila </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>, 27; her daughter, <PERSON> Shantel </PERSON> <PERSON> Osborne </PERSON>, 4; her stepfather, <PERSON> Owen </PERSON> <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON>, 45; her mother, <PERSON> Myrtle </PERSON> <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON>, 44; and the little girl's father, <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Osborne </PERSON>, 33. The prosecution said <PERSON> Lowenfield </PERSON> was jealous of Miss <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>. They said the couple had lived together in a stormy relationship until earlier in the summer of 1982 when he set the house on fire and she moved out. Investigators found a notebook full of obscenities and threats. In one place he wrote, `` She have to go to the wormes she took all I work for then leave to go and be with <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> but I just can not take it eany more.'' <PERSON> Lowenfield </PERSON> was arrested two months later in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Parts of the evidence against him were letters he wrote Miss <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>' relatives while he was jailed in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. One said <PERSON> Osborne </PERSON> had grabbed the child as a shield and <PERSON> Lowenfield </PERSON> had shot both of them. On trial, <PERSON> Lowenfield </PERSON> insisted on an alibi defense, saying he was in <LOCATION> Jacksonville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, looking for work at the time of the murders. After a separate trial to determine the penalty, jurors came back three times saying they could not decide whether he should die. Prodded on by the judge, they decided on the fourth try to condemn him to death.

 A man convicted of raping and maiming a teenager almost 10 years ago is seeking a criminal investigation into his allegation that the woman actually kidnapped him, a newspaper reported Monday. <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Singleton </PERSON>, who is scheduled to be freed April 25 after serving seven years and nine months in prison and a year on parole, said he filed a complaint in <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Placer </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Marin </LOCATION> counties requesting the woman's arrest, the <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ledger </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Antioch </ORGANIZATION> reported. <PERSON> Singleton </PERSON>, 60, was convicted in 1979 of raping <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Vincent </PERSON>, then 15, and hacking off her forearms with an ax on Sept. 29, 1978. He was sentenced to 14 years and 4 months in prison, which was reduced for good behavior and work credit. <PERSON> Singleton </PERSON> said he will move to <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> to spend his `` first few days'' of freedom with a church group after his release, the newspaper said, but he did not rule out a return to <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Singleton </PERSON> has spent the last 10 months of his parole in a trailer on the grounds of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Quentin </LOCATION> state prison for his own protection after residents of several northern <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> communities protested against his planned parole last year. <PERSON> Vincent </PERSON>, who expressed anxiety about his parole at that time, has moved to the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Northwest </LOCATION> and recently told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> through an intermediary that she did not want to be interviewed further about <PERSON> Singleton </PERSON>. The Ledger said it obtained a copy of a 12-page, typewritten complaint in which <PERSON> Singleton </PERSON> alleges <PERSON> Vincent </PERSON> committed kidnap for the purpose of robbery and use of two deadly weapons. According to the Ledger, the complaint said <PERSON> Singleton </PERSON> was heading to <PERSON> Sparks </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Nev. </LOCATION>, when he picked up <PERSON> Vincent </PERSON> hitchhiking in <LOCATION> Berkeley </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, and agreed to take her to <PERSON> Reno </PERSON>. The complaint said <PERSON> Vincent </PERSON> began smoking PCP, a hallucinogen, then said she wanted to go to <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, became abusive and poked <PERSON> Singleton </PERSON> with a three-foot surveyor stick, the newspaper reported. `` -LRB- She -RRB- told me that if I did not comply with her wishes she would poke out my eyes, smash my face, and hurt, hurt, hurt me and say that I raped her,'' the newspaper quoted the complaint as saying. The complaint also alleges <PERSON> Vincent </PERSON> threatened <PERSON> Singleton </PERSON> with a six-inch fish-scaling knife, the newspaper reported. <PERSON> Singleton </PERSON> claims he drove <PERSON> Vincent </PERSON> to <LOCATION> Galt </LOCATION>, 20 miles south of <LOCATION> Sacramento </LOCATION>, where he picked up two male hitchhikers who joined <PERSON> Vincent </PERSON> in extorting money from <PERSON> Singleton </PERSON> to buy drugs, the newspaper reported. The complaint says <PERSON> Singleton </PERSON> drove north and left <LOCATION> Vincent </LOCATION> in a `` low-rent district'' in <LOCATION> Sacramento </LOCATION> and never saw her again, the newspaper reported. Although not in the complaint, <PERSON> Singleton </PERSON> has repeatedly claimed he allowed one of the hitchhikers to drive while he was drinking, passed out, then awoke to find <PERSON> Vincent </PERSON> was gone but her clothes were still in the van. The hitchhikers, he has contended, committed the crimes. Authorities, however, have maintained the two hitchhikers never existed. <PERSON> Singleton </PERSON> said in a telephone interview he mailed the complaint Saturday to authorities in the two counties, but court clerks in both counties said Monday morning they had not received the complaints, the Ledger reported.

<TEXT>
 Soybean market prices are averaging the most in three years because of greater world demand and a tightening of available supplies, an <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> analysis shows. Drought has damaged <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>'s soybean crop, and the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> has increased its demand for the oilseed, the department's <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said Monday. That has helped whittle down <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> soybean stockpiles and boost prices. The supply-and-demand report said soybean prices now could average in the range of $ 5.50 to $ 5.80 per bushel in the marketing year that began last Sept. 1, up from $ 5.35 to $ 5.75 forecast in March. Prices averaged $ 4.78 per bushel in the 1986-87 season. According to <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> records, that would be the most since soybeans averaged $ 5.84 per bushel in 1984-85. They were $ 7.83 in the 1983-84 marketing year. Soybean exports were forecast at 785 million bushels, up from 760 million indicated last month and the 757 million bushels shipped in 1986-87. Wheat exports also have improved, due mainly to subsidized sales to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> under the department's Export Enhancement Program, or EEP. In all, exports in the wheat marketing year that runs through May 31 are estimated at 1.6 billion bushels, a 60 percent increase from 1 billion bushels shipped in 1986-87. Average market prices for this season were put at $ 2.55 per bushel, up from $ 2.42 last year. Corn exports also are up, rising to an estimated 1.7 billion bushels in the corn marketing year that began last Sept. 1, compared with 1.5 billion bushels in 1986-87. Market prices of corn were forecast to average $ 1.65 to $ 1.85 per bushel this season, up from $ 1.50 in 1986-87.

 Agriculture Department scientists are looking at the neem tree of <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> as a possible source of material to prevent the formation of aflatoxin, a food toxin that occurs in nature. Aflatoxin can be produced by fungi that forms on some farm crops under certain conditions, including corn and oilseeds. Laboratory tests with animals have shown that aflatoxin is among the most powerful cancer-causing agents known, and <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> has called it a `` potential'' hazard to humans. <PERSON> Deepak </PERSON> <PERSON> Bhatnagar </PERSON> said in a report released here that as a child in <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> his parents used to put leaves of the neem tree inside containers of wheat to keep insects from the grain. Now, as a <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> scientist, he has found that the leaves may also block fungi from producing aflatoxin. In tests at the department's <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> center in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> La. </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bhatnagar </PERSON> made solutions containing neem leaves. He found that the solutions did n't kill the fungi but did block more than 98 percent of the aflatoxin they normally would have produced. The fungi that produce the toxin are Aspergillus flavus and A. parasiticus. <PERSON> Bhatnagar </PERSON> said the results were `` promising, but preliminary'' and that greenhouse studies with cotton are now being planned. The ornamental neem is also known as margosa and nim. More than 80 insect pests, including Mexican bean beetles, <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> potato beetles, tobacco budworms and carpet beetles are repelled by neem extracts.

 Spice imports totaled about $ 439 million last year, up 12 percent from 1986, says the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. The rise was due mainly to larger imports of vanilla beans, white pepper, nutmeg and mace, cassia, cumin, anise, capsicum peppers, laurel and thyme, the department's <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> reported Monday. Higher prices of many of the items also were a factor. `` Saffron prices have soared in recent months, reflecting a short Spanish crop,'' the report said. Also, it added, cesium contamination from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s nuclear mishap at <LOCATION> Chernobyl </LOCATION> two years ago `` has kept supplies tight and prices firm for several Mediterranean-area herbs such as oregano, laurel, rosemary and sage.

<HEAD>Young People Are Feeling The Tax Bite, Too, As Friday Approaches</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Millions of young Americans are filling out federal tax returns for the first time as Friday's filing deadline approaches, and many of them are learning that you do n't always get a refund. Several new provisions affecting students who work part-time and youngsters under the age of 14 took effect in 1987 and are being felt on returns filed this year. The net effect is to complicate the finances of these people and, in many cases, of their parents. The <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> estimates 3.3 million people are having to file returns for the first time because a section of the 1986 law denies a personal exemption, worth $ 1,900 for 1987, to those who can be claimed as a dependent by a parent or someone else. In addition, young people can lose a good portion of their $ 2,540 standard deduction by being claimed by a parent. And thresholds for filing are lower than in the past. Two other new provisions:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 _ Any child 5 or older who is claimed as a dependent must have a Social Security number, which must be listed on the parents' The <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> has waived the penalty for not listing the number on 1987 returns, but it's still required. _ Any investment income exceeding $ 1,000 received by a child under 14 is now taxed at the parents' higher rate, assuming that is higher than the child's rate These calculations must be made on Form 8615, which must be attached to the child's return. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> imposed this requirement to block mainly higher-income parents from avoiding taxes by shifting income-producing property to a child. Under the old law, a parent could have avoided $ 390 of tax on $ 1,000 worth of interest that was credited to the child's account, paying $ 110 instead of $ 500 This `` kiddie tax'' provision has been a source of anguish for taxpayers, experts say. `` There is more confusion in trying to fill out the forms than there is surprise about so many minors having to file for the first time,'' says <PERSON> Vern </PERSON> <PERSON> Martens </PERSON>, senior tax attorney at <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> headquarters in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Three other new forms are causing questions, too, although relatively few of the 107 million couples and individuals who are expected to file returns this year will have to face them. They are: _ 8598, which fewer than 1 million people will have to file to calculate how much of their home mortgage interest is deductible It generally applies only to those whose outstanding mortgage and home equity loans total more than the purchase price of the home and any improvements. _ 8606, required mainly of middle - and upper-income taxpayers who make non-deductible contributions to an _ 8582, for calculating losses on rental operations and other `` passive-activity'' investments If you do n't feel ready to tackle any of these forms _ or the basic 1040 or 1040A _ you might consider filing Form 4868. Filing this form, and your check for what you estimate you owe, by midnight Friday will give you an extra four months to file your return. If you underestimate your taxes, you will be liable for interest and penalty on the shortage. But the four-month reprieve might keep you from rushing into a mistake. The <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> expects about 6 \ million couples and individuals to ask for the automatic delay, about 1 million more than last year <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> <PERSON> Fadely </PERSON> cautions: `` If you wait until the last day to look at the library or Post Office for the form, you may not find one.'' The <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> expects 37 million returns during the three weeks ending April 22. More than 58 million had been received by April 1. Some of the remainder will be filed after the deadline; some will come later from military personnel stationed abroad; and some taxpayers have different deadlines. The <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> has processed 81 percent of the returns received so far, down slightly from last year. More than 77 percent are getting refunds, compared with 78 percent at this time last year. Refunds are averaging $ 825, up from $ 806. Although tax rates were cut, many people are paying more tax because all or parts of several deductions were lost. These include sales taxes, consumer interest, medical expenses, such miscellaneous itemized writeoffs as union dues, the special deduction for two-earner couples, and _ in many cases _ some or all the deduction for Individual Retirement Account contributions.

 Treasury Secretary <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> seems to be making progress in his drive to get the world's top economic powers to use the price of gold and other commodities to help them coordinate economic policies. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> took economic leaders by surprise when he advanced the idea last September, with some countries openly skeptical. But <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> has demonstrated considerable skill as one of the administration's top negotiators and officials indicated Monday that the world's seven top industrial countries are likely to give formal approval to <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>'s commodity-index proposal on Wednesday. The seven nations, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, will hold high-level talks in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> as part of the spring meeting of the 151-nation <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monetary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION>. A senior <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official, briefing reporters Monday, said the administration is `` hopeful there will be some agreement'' by the seven countries to adopt the commodity-basket proposal. The official spoke on condition his name not be used. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> has stressed that he is not proposing a return to the gold standard, the system in use for 25 years after World War II. For most of that time, the price of gold was fixed at $ 35 an ounce and the currencies of other countries were pegged at fixed exchange rates to the dollar. That system broke down in the early 1970s under the weight of higher inflation and a rising flow of international capital between countries. It was replaced with today's floating exchange rate system under which the value of each nation's currency is set on the open market. But the extreme volatility in floating rates, especially for the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar, has driven the big industrial countries in search of ways to stabilize exchange rates. One method that <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> has pushed since the <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> economic summit in 1986 has been the use of a variety of economic indicators to monitor each country's performance in helping to sustain worldwide growth. This group of indicators includes individual growth rates, inflation and trade balances. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>'s proposal would add gold and other commodity prices to the list of economic yardsticks the countries use to coordinate policies. This approach would introduce a price-sensitive measure into the economic planning process. In addition to gold, other commodities which might be included are iron ore, copper, rubber, cotton, wheat, rice, corn, coffee and tea. If the price of these commodities rose in particular countries, those nations would be encouraged to boost interest rates to fight inflation. But if commodity prices were falling, the countries would know they had room to cut interest rates and stimulate economic growth without danger of inflation. Some countries, in particular <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, have opposed the commodity index because they see it as a device that would be used to goad them into achieving faster growth at the risk of sparking inflation. But in a television interview Monday, <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said the seven top industrial countries were in basic agreement at present over the steps needed to stabilize exchange rates. `` The major industrialized countries of the world obviously favor stability of exchange rates and we have been very pleased with the stability we have seen since our last meeting in December,'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said on <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Today'' program. Last Dec. 22, the seven countries pledged to support the dollar, which at the time was under heavy selling pressure. That commitment was backed up by massive intervention, the process by which governments buy weak currencies such as the dollar to drive up the price.

<HEAD>After 10 Years of Reform, Teachers Still Not Full-Fledged
Professionals</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LEE MITGANG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Education Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A decade of school reform has produced stacks of legislation, higher teacher pay and tighter teaching requirements but has left unresolved whether teachers are full-fledged professionals, a report says. `` By sheer volume of legislation, it is clear that teaching has been ` reformed,''' said the 80-page <ORGANIZATION> Rand </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> report, `` The Evolution of Teacher Policy,'' released Monday. `` Teaching policy is up for grabs _ and there are lots of people grabbing,'' it said. The net result of hundreds of education-related bills enacted during the past decade has been contradiction and confusion, concluded the report by researchers <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Darling-Hammond </PERSON> and <PERSON> Barnett </PERSON> <PERSON> Barry </PERSON>. School reform has yet to settle whether teachers are professionals possessing a body of knowledge and capable of dealing with the individual needs of students, or whether they are merely `` semiskilled workers'' needing constant supervision, the researchers said. Still, the report found that average salaries rose 31 percent from 1981 to 1986 to $ 25,240, and 19 states adopted minimum salary schedules. More recent figures from the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> estimate average salaries at $ 28,000 this year. Starting salaries are also up, but not enough to close the gap between teaching and other professions. According to NEA figures, the average was $ 17,500 in 1987, while beginning accountants, chemists, computer specialists and engineers, for example, all earned in excess of $ 20,000. Overall, the average teacher's purchasing power is practically unchanged from 1971-72 levels, according to the analysis. Nearly all states considered performance-based pay systems, including merit pay, from 1983 to 1986. But such programs often have encountered delays because of teacher opposition and lack of funds. Twenty-seven states enacted tougher teacher training requirements, including testing of academic ability and minimum grade-point averages. States are increasingly stressing liberal arts background over education courses. `` Paradoxically, for a number of states, improving teacher preparation seems to mean reducing the amount of time devoted to traditional teacher education,'' the report said. By 1986, 46 states required teacher competency testing for admission to teacher education or certification or both. But such testing has stalled in many states because of lack of funding or questions about the tests's validity. In a contradiction, 46 states have cleared the way for substandard, limited emergency certification. Twenty-seven of those states issue certificates to people lacking even a bachelor's degree to solve teacher shortages `` This practice undermines the tenet ... that only those who have mastered a specialized knowledge base will be admitted to practice,'' the report said. <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Hatwood </PERSON> <PERSON> Futrell </PERSON> called the Rand report `` right on target.'' <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldberg </PERSON>, assistant director of educational issues for the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Teachers </ORGANIZATION>, called the report `` obviously correct. If teaching is to become a true profession, then teachers will have to be granted the kind of autonomy required of any other profession.'' The Rand study is being published nearly five years after the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration issued the report `` A Nation at Risk,'' which blasted mediocrity in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> schools. While initial reform efforts aimed at boosting salaries and toughening teacher certification requirements, a more recent wave of reforms has stressed freeing teachers from unnecessary regulations and boosting their status. In effect, reformers in the last two years have come to believe that there should be higher standards to enter teaching, but fewer rules about what and how to teach. `` This is, in essence, the bargain that all professions make with society,'' the report said. `` The next generation of teacher policy reform will need to focus on the content and nature of effective teaching, its assessment, and its deployment within schools to ensure that the long-range goals of the reformers are met,'' the report concluded.

 Americans are more willing than their representatives in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to consider changes in the Social Security system, but no single option for cutting costs has broad public support, according to a survey. The public also strongly favors pulling <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops out of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> as a way to reduce the federal budget deficit, according to the survey by the League of Concerned Americans, a <LOCATION> Charlotte </LOCATION>, N.C.-based non-profit group. The league commissioned the nationwide poll as part of a project called `` <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s Budget,'' an effort to determine national spending priorities from a non-Washington perspective. It planned to release a suggested budget today. `` A lot of things that are perceptually true in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> ... are not that way across the country,'' said <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Rasmussen </PERSON>, founder of the league. For example, an informal congressional survey showed 80 percent of the members favored leaving the Social Security system untouched. Only 34 percent favored that option in the nationwide poll. However, people differed over what changes should be made, the poll showed. From a list of options, 21 percent favored making the system voluntary and 25 percent supported raising the retirement age to allow a drop in the Social Security tax. Only 6 percent favored cutting cost-of-living adjustments for retirees _ the most frequently mentioned option when <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> considers cutbacks. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has been holding hearings this year on what lawmakers call `` burden sharing'' _ forcing <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> allies to take on more of the cost of defending against the Soviet bloc. The informal survey of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> showed only 12 percent said they would favor gradually withdrawing `` a substantial portion'' of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops from <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> over the next 20 years. However, more than three out of four citizens polled supported the idea. The poll was conducted for the league by <ORGANIZATION> Marketwise </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. The random sample of 519 respondents has a margin of error of 4.3 percentage points. Despite the 1983 changes in the Social Security, which included raising taxes to build up big surpluses over the next few years, more than a fourth of the people polled still doubt whether their benefits will be there when they retire, according to the survey. `` I think there is a real temptation -LRB- to spend the money -RRB- if there are surpluses,'' said <PERSON> Rasmussen </PERSON>. Sen. <PERSON> Lawton </PERSON> <PERSON> Chiles </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Fla </LOCATION>., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said Monday he would propose a resolution to put <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on record opposing the current accounting system which allows Social Security surpluses to hide the true size of the government's operating deficit <PERSON> Rasmussen </PERSON>, a business entrepreneur who with his father founded the <ORGANIZATION> ESPN </ORGANIZATION> sports network in 1978, said he hoped the league would help prod the politicians to keep working toward a balanced budget. The results were being presented to the new national commission on the deficit, which will make recommendations for the next president and <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on ways to cut red ink, he said.

 A jumbo jet bound for <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> made a successful emergency landing here Monday after the plastic layers in one of the cockpit side windows began to come apart, an airport spokesman said.

<HEAD>WASHINGTON WIRE: Politics? Here's What it Really Means ...</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAWRENCE L. KNUTSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A new book offers some timely definitions in this season of taxes and politics, including the observation that a `` front-runner'' these days is someone who claims to be the underdog for fear of going the way of his predecessors. Or, for example, that the art of taxation has been defined as `` so plucking the goose as to obtain the largest amount of feathers with the least amount of hissing.'' Front-runner is `` what all candidates want to be, but do n't want to be called,'' says the recently published `` <ORGANIZATION> Dorsey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dictionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Politics </ORGANIZATION>,'' a product of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Dorsey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. With 4,000 entries, the book compiled and written by <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shafritz </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pittsburgh </ORGANIZATION> graduate school aims to capture in dictionary form the nuts and bolts of American constitutional government, including the slang and stories of its 199 years of existence. It provides descriptions of government agencies, court decisions, people, places, things and states of mind. A box charts the rise of the federal budget deficit from $ 2.8 billion under President <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> in 1970 to $ 220.7 billion under President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> in 1986. One entry recalls <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Jefferson </PERSON> asking <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Washington </PERSON> why the constitutional convention _ over which <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> had presided _ had created a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> as well as a House. `` Why do you pour your coffee into your saucer?'' <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> is supposed to have asked <PERSON> Jefferson </PERSON>. `` To cool it,'' <PERSON> Jefferson </PERSON> replied. `` Even so,'' concluded <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. `` We pour legislation into the senatorial saucer to cool it.'' Flipping through the pages, one finds that one possible origin of the word <ORGANIZATION> Yankee </ORGANIZATION> to designate Americans in general or <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Englanders </LOCATION> in particular is from `` a corruption of <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Kees </PERSON>, an unkind Dutch nickname meaning <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheese </PERSON>.'' `` The Dutch, who first settled <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, applied the name to the English who followed,'' the dictionary says. Then there is `` stand pat.'' It is described as a phrase originating in the game of poker that has been extended to mean one who accepts a present situation or stands by an existing policy. `` Nobody in American politics today is in favor of standing pat,'' the dictionary maintains and adds: `` There is a classic piece of film from the 1960 presidential campaign in which <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>, with his wife, <PERSON> Pat </PERSON>, seated behind him, energetically tells an audience that _ ` We ca n't stand pat.''' `` Subsequently, to Mrs. <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>'s presumed relief, he changed that line to ` <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> can not stand still.''' As his term nears an end, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> is at times referred to as a `` lame duck.'' The dictionary says the phrase originated in the early days of the <ORGANIZATION> London </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> which then operated out of Exchange Alley. The dictionary: `` A broker who went bankrupt would ` waddle out of the alley' like a lame duck.'' The expression has long since crossed the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> and expanded its meaning to any soon-to-be-out-of-office leader whose authority is consequently impaired. Most of the dictionary's topics involve serious subjects. Deregulation, deterrence, devaluation and dictators, for example. But it does have flashes of humor. One such flash: How to tell the difference between Republicans and Democrats. The dictionary quotes from the anonymous wit whose musings were inserted in the Congressional Record some years ago by the late <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> Hosmer </PERSON>, then a Republican congressman from <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. To wit: `` Democrats buy most of the books that have been banned somewhere. Republicans form censorship committees and read them as a group. `` Democrats give their worn-out clothes to those less fortunate. Republicans wear theirs. `` Republicans employ exterminators. Democrats step on the bugs. `` Democrats name their children after currently popular sports figures, politicians and entertainers. Republican children are named after their parents or grandparents, according to where the most money is. `` Republicans tend to keep their shades down, although there is seldom any reason why they should. Democrats ought to, but do n't. `` Republicans study the financial pages of the newspaper. Democrats put them in the bottom of the bird cage. `` Republicans raise dahlias, Dalmatians and eyebrows. Democrats raise Airedales, kids and taxes. `` Democrats eat the fish they catch. Republicans hang them on the wall. `` Republican boys date Democratic girls. They plan to marry <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> girls but feel they're entitled to a little fun first. `` Democrats make up plans and then do something else. Republicans follow the plans their grandparents made. `` Republicans sleep in twin beds _ some even in separate rooms. This is why there are more Democrats.''

 The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, western <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and other big grain producers should create a fund that would help develop farming in the Third World, French Agriculture Minister <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Guillaume </PERSON> says. <PERSON> Guillaume </PERSON> says such a plan would help narrow the growing gap between rich and poor countries. <PERSON> Guillaume </PERSON> spoke Monday at an open meeting with <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> officials and farm experts. `` Public opinion can not understand that politicans in the developed countries are unable to put the grains stored in American and <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> silos into the stomachs of men and women in developing countries,'' he said. Meanwhile, both the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and western <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> are each spending about $ 30 billion a year to subsidize farmers, he said. During a news conference he described his proposal, under which grain producers would fix a floor price for grain at a level that would not stimulate new production. They would then contribute part of the difference between the floor price and actual selling prices to a fund that <PERSON> Guillaume </PERSON> likened to the Marshall Plan, which helped western <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> recover from World War II. The fund would be used to improve farming in Third World countries. He estimated that it could furnish $ 1.8 billion to $ 4 billion a year from exporters of grain amd could be increased by voluntary countributions from rich importers, such as <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Amstutz </PERSON>, chief <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> negotiator for world farm issues, came out strongly against any plan to set prices and limit production. He said one reason it would not work is that all producers could not be included and those who did not join would increase their production. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration has been pushing a plan to phase out by the end of the century all subsidies affecting world trade in farm products.

 The government on Monday proposed a resumption of talks with rebels on details of a cease-fire plan after negotiations ended last week in disagreement over arms shipments. The Sandinista government suggested the technical discussions be resumed Wednesday or Thursday in <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION>, the capital. It also proposed that the rebels, known as Contras, send an advance team to <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION> on Tuesday to prepare for discussions Sandinista and rebel political leaders are scheduled to hold on Friday. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Contra </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Bosco </PERSON> <PERSON> Matamoros </PERSON> who is a member of the special negotiating commission released a statement late Monday saying the technical talks should resume at noon on Wednesday in the border village of <LOCATION> Sapoa </LOCATION>. The statement said the <ORGANIZATION> Contra </ORGANIZATION>'s ranking political leaders would travel to <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION> on Friday for negotiations, based on progress at the <LOCATION> Sapoa </LOCATION> talks. There was no immediate response from the government. <PERSON> Matamoros </PERSON>' statement said the Contras would send an advance delegation to <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION> Thursday to prepare for the political talks. It said the Contra representatives would include <PERSON> Roberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferrey </PERSON>, secretary of the directorate of the Contras' umbrella Nicaraguan Resistance group, and <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Stadhagen </PERSON>. A preliminary peace plan signed March 23 in <LOCATION> Sapoa </LOCATION> called for the two sides to hold technical discussions to work out details of a 60-day cease-fire that went into effect April 1. The talks between military commanders are to spell out how the Contras are to gather in cease-fire zones. During the truce, the two sides are to hold negotiations leading to a permanent agreement to end more than six years of war between the U.S.-backed Contras and the government. Military leaders have held six days of technical talks since March 28 at <LOCATION> Sapoa </LOCATION>, 90 miles south of <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION> and beside the Costa Rican border. They have agreed only on seven zones in which the Contras are to gather but have failed to decide on security measures and how the rebels are to receive supplies in the zones. The meetings ended Friday after the Contras asked for a recess of several days to discuss a 25-point plan the government proposed. The Contras earlier offered a 34-point plan. Last week the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> suggested the technical talks be resumed Friday, when the political leaders are to hold their discussions. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Reichler </PERSON>, an American lawyer negotiating for the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION>, said over the weekend that there were only two points of contention in the proposal presented by the Contras. The Contra proposals would allow the rebels to receive arms, ammunition and war materiel while in the zones. It also would ban the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> from receiving any military aid, which is supplied by the Soviet bloc. <PERSON> Reichler </PERSON> described those two points as `` absolutely unacceptable.'' The original cease-fire plan would permit the Contras to receive only food and basic supplies channeled through a neutral organization, such as the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION>. Political leaders of both sides had been scheduled to meet last Wednesday in <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION>. The rebels postponed them, saying the technical talks had not advanced enough to move toward political issues. The rebels also have said they will not participate in this week's high-level political talks unless they are free to meet with opposition leaders. The government maintains that the peace agreement specifies Contra representation in politics begins only after the rebels move into the cease-fire zones.

 A team of Soviet officials is readying for a second round of talks aimed at sorting through arrangements for verifying the arms treaty eliminating intermediate-range nuclear weapons. The Soviet team of 10 to 14 military and civilian officials was due in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> today and planned to meet behind closed doors with an American group starting on Wednesday, the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> said Monday. According to one <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official who asked not to be named, the talks will extend at least to Saturday and will focus on a variety of `` housekeeping details'' that must be settled before the two sides begin compliance inspections. `` Some of the topics on the plate include living quarters for inspectors, call signs for aircraft traveling in each country, the logistics of moving and putting in place the equipment we'll need and what equipment we're planning to use, and even how we deal with the news media,'' said the source. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> want to reach agreement on such details in advance of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> vote on ratifying the new treaty to ensure a smooth start for the compliance inspections, the official added. Signed by President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> on Dec. 8, the new treaty specifies that all nuclear missiles in the two superpower arsenals with a range of roughly 300 miles to 3,500 miles be destroyed within three years. Within the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government, the Pentagon has created an organization known as the <ORGANIZATION> On-Site </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inspection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> to verify <LOCATION> Russian </LOCATION> compliance with the new treaty. The head of that agency, <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brig </ORGANIZATION>. Gen. <PERSON> Roland </PERSON> <PERSON> Lajoie </PERSON>, will lead the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> team in this week's discussions. The two sides held their first round of talks in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> last month. The <ORGANIZATION> OSIA </ORGANIZATION> will be responsible for escorting Soviet inspectors who travel to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> to monitor the removal and destruction of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> nuclear weapons, as well as performing the same role inside the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> by visiting Russian facilities and deployment sites.

 Astronomers may have to change their ideas about the early universe because of the discovery of the oldest and most distant galaxy ever observed, researchers said. The galaxy, about 10 times the size of the Milky Way, was formed before the universe was a mere 2 billion years old, said its discoverer, <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> <PERSON> Lilly </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hawaii </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Manoa </LOCATION>. Researchers have previously found indirect evidence of galaxies forming at extreme distances, but this is the first clear observation of a mature galaxy at those distances, <PERSON> Lilly </PERSON> said Monday in a telephone interview. `` This pushes back the time at which galaxies formed in the early universe,'' he said. The discovery could force a revision in astronomers' conception of the universe, <PERSON> Lilly </PERSON> said. `` If we find more objects like this, the cold-dark-matter scenario will be in trouble,'' he said. That scenario says that most of the universe exists in the form of cold, dark material that we can not observe. It also predicts that massive galaxies like the one discovered should not exist so early in the history of the universe, <PERSON> Lilly </PERSON> said. In January, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Elston </PERSON> and <PERSON> George </PERSON> and <PERSON> Marcia </PERSON> <PERSON> Rieke </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arizona </ORGANIZATION> reported the possible existence of even older, more distant galaxies, but those results are not yet confirmed, <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Rieke </PERSON> said Monday. `` I would say he has claim to the most distant galaxy,'' <PERSON> Rieke </PERSON> said. `` We have claim to having found candidates that may be even more distant, but that's different from having it nailed down.'' Nevertheless, <PERSON> Rieke </PERSON> said, the two lines of research mesh nicely, because `` the existence of his galaxy implies that something like the galaxies that we have candidates for must exist.'' <PERSON> Harding </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, a physicist at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION>, who has studied distant galaxies, said <PERSON> Lilly </PERSON> `` has made a substantial jump, and I do think it's an important result.'' It will help astronomers understand the processes that form galaxies, <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said. `` We do n't understand when they form and how they form, and both of these are very interesting questions because they may tell us more about what happened even earliier in the universe,'' <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said. A report of <PERSON> Lilly </PERSON>'s work has been accepted for publication in the <ORGANIZATION> Astrophysical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION>, he said. To determine an object's distance and age, astronomers observe the so-called redshift of light emitted by the object. The higher the redshift, the older and more distant the object. <PERSON> Lilly </PERSON>'s galaxy has a redshift of 3.4, he said. The oldest and most distant galaxy observed before his had a redshift of 1.8, he said. The <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> researchers are searching for evidence of new galaxies at redshifts of 6 to 25, <PERSON> Rieke </PERSON> said. The age of the universe can not be precisely determined, <PERSON> Lilly </PERSON> said, but the best estimates put it at between 10 billion and 20 billion years. If a figure of 15 billion years is arbitrarily chosen as a starting point, then the redshift of <PERSON> Lilly </PERSON>'s galaxy means the light that <PERSON> Lilly </PERSON> observed left the galaxy when the universe was about 3 billion years old. Observations of the galaxy itself indicate it was then 1 billion or 2 billion years old, he said, meaning it was formed when the universe was 1 billion to 2 billion years old. <PERSON> Lilly </PERSON> said his research involved identifying the source of a distant emission of radio waves that was recorded in 1981. He used the Canada-France-Hawaii optical telescope and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kingdom </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Infrared </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Telescope </LOCATION> _ both located atop <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Mauna </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kea </LOCATION> volcano _ to pick up light and infrared radiation from the precise point where the radio emission had been detected Those observations allowed him to identify it as a mature galaxy.

<TEXT>
 Riding the <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> press bus at times can be like attending a meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> has attracted intense interest by the international news media _ in part, because of what one Frenchman called his `` star'' quality. News agencies from all over the world have sent writers and TV crews to cover his bid for the Democratic presidential nomination. `` The campaigns of the other candidates are so boring that <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> is the only one to emerge,'' said <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> Match correspondent <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> Royant </PERSON>. The foreign coverage is increasing in anticipation of the crucial <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> primary on April 19, his aides say. Traveling with <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s entourage last weekend were reporters from <LOCATION> Ecuador </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. Off and on, the campaign also has seen representatives from news agencies of other nations including <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Holland </LOCATION>. At one point campaign aides even considered having a news conference just for the foreign press _ because all wanted interviews with the candidate and their questions were of a different nature than those asked by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> reporters, said press secretary <PERSON> DelMarie </PERSON> <PERSON> Cobb </PERSON>. The interest seems to center on <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> as a person and international celebrity, his eloquence and flair, and on the historical significance of his candidacy. Foreign reporters said they were looking for those kinds of stories more than at <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s stance on issues. <PERSON> Cobb </PERSON> said the foreign press also asks a lot of questions about whether the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is ready to elect a black president. On the other hand, <PERSON> Raghida </PERSON> <PERSON> Dergham </PERSON> of the London-based Lebanese magazine <ORGANIZATION> Al-Hawadress </ORGANIZATION> said editors in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> are very interested in the foreign policies of <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, who enjoys considerable support in the Arab-American community. <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> correspondent <PERSON> Kent </PERSON> <PERSON> Barker </PERSON> said <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> was `` certainly the most interesting to foreign eyes. He's the most colorful, dramatic'' presidential candidate this year The <ORGANIZATION> BBC </ORGANIZATION>'s audience is also interested in <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s liberalism and sees him as aligned with the philosophies of the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, he said. In <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, people are more aware of <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> than the other candidates, even though <ORGANIZATION> RAI </ORGANIZATION> television has done a profile on <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, said RAI cameraman <PERSON> Michele </PERSON> <PERSON> Capasso </PERSON>. He cited `` the style and excitement around him'' as reasons <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> makes a good story. `` In <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, every <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> election, people want to know two things,'' said <PERSON> Royant </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> Match. `` Are we going to find a Kennedy this year? ... Who is the star? This year <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> is the star.'' <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> Match did a profile of <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> in October, and <PERSON> Royant </PERSON> is working on a second profile that will appear some time before the summer nominating conventions. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> has visited <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> in the past and is well-known there, said <PERSON> Royant </PERSON>. Additionally, there is interest in the candidacy of a black man 20 years after the death of civil rights leader <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Luther </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON>, <PERSON> Royant </PERSON> said.

 The Democratic presidential contenders are telling <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to disregard President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s threat to veto a trade bill if it calls for mandatory advance layoff notices. <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> sent letters over the weekend urging Sen. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, a key architect of the sweeping trade bill, to resist further weakening of the labor-sought notice provision. <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> earlier had sent a similar letter to <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, urging him to retain the notice provision `` regardless of the president's intentions.'' The letters arrived on Capitol Hill as <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> are engaged in an intense competition for the 255 convention delegates at stake in the April 19 primary in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, a state where one in every three workers carries a union card. `` I can only conclude that the real reason many companies oppose a notice requirement _ and the reason those same companies do not give advance notice now _ is that they do not care what happens to workers or their communities,'' <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> said in his letter. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said his campaign speeches on the need for advance layoff notices have received enthusiastic responses and that `` it is difficult to believe that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> would not override such an ill-advised veto.'' `` The inclusion of the provision in the trade bill has been helpful in making working people aware that the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> is responding to some of their very fundamental concerns,'' he said in his letter to <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION>, which has made the trade bill its top legislative priority for six years, has threatened to withdraw its support for it entirely if the layoff notices are eliminated. `` I could understand our so-called trading partners being opposed to the bill,'' <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION> Secretary-Treasurer <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Donahue </PERSON> said Monday. `` But he's -LRB- <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> -RRB- supposed to be the president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.'' Under the provision, companies with more than 100 employees would be required to give 60 days advance notice when they intend to close a plant or lay off one-third or more of its workforce. However, the layoffs would have to total at least 50 workers to trigger the mandatory notices. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> and other <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> `` superconferees'' are scheduled to start meeting today in hopes of getting a final version of the trade bill by Thursday or Friday for separate votes in each house on final passage. Without citing specific provisions, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said in his weekend radio address Saturday he still has `` very _ underline very _ serious reservations'' about the bill. `` The bottom line is this: I will veto a bad trade bill before I let a bad trade bill veto our economy.'' While administration officials have outlined objections to several provisions, congressional leaders describe most of the protests as `` padding'' for its vehement opposition to the mandatory layoff notices. `` It's a classic game of everybody trying to figure out what the other guy's bottom line is,'' said one legislative aide, who acknowledged one purpose of the candidates' letters is to counter administration veto threats. Just a week ago, <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> McLaughlin </PERSON> wrote <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Democratic Leader <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> she would be `` forced to recommend that the president veto the bill ... if these protectionist mandatory plant closing and layoff requirements remain.'' A <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> task force last year called advance notices `` an essential component of a readjustment program'' for helping laid off workers get new jobs, but stopped short of saying the notices should be mandated. According to the <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Statistics </ORGANIZATION>, two of every three workers laid off in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> receive no advance notice. The average notice, according to a separate survey by the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>, is 14 days for white-collar workers and seven days for blue-collar workers.

The rhino was made about eight years ago from old steel automobile bumpers by `` bumper sculpture'' artist <PERSON> Jon </PERSON> <PERSON> Bedford </PERSON>, a former <LOCATION> Salida </LOCATION> resident. <PERSON> Harrington </PERSON> bought it for display in front of his hardware business on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> 50.

 A <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> student judiciary board agreed Monday to settle a dispute over a communist's election as co-president of the student body. The three-member student <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> heard a motion Monday night that would declare the election invalid. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanchez </PERSON>, the panel's chief judge, said a ruling on the motion would be issued Wednesday prior to a scheduled meeting of the undergraduate Student Senate. <PERSON> Jason </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabinowitz </PERSON>, a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Young </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION>, and his co-candidate, non-communist <PERSON> Shari </PERSON> <PERSON> Silkoff </PERSON>, were elected March 15. <PERSON> Rabinowitz </PERSON> is believed to be the first YCL member elected campus president since the group was formed five years ago. Student Attorney General <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Collins </PERSON> filed the motion asking the judiciary board to declare the Rabinowitz-Silkoff ticket invalid because the student government constitution allows only one person to hold the office of president. `` I think I'm winning,'' <PERSON> Collins </PERSON> said after the session, `` but the point is I ca n't just win. I have to win convincingly.'' Monday night's hearing was mostly spent on arguments by a student lawyer representing <PERSON> Rabinowitz </PERSON> and <PERSON> Silkoff </PERSON>, who attempted to show that the writers of the student constitution did not mean to prevent more than one person from serving. Conservatives on the 90-member undergraduate student <ORGANIZATION> senate </ORGANIZATION> filibustered last week to keep the election from being ratified and stop <PERSON> Rabinowitz </PERSON> and <PERSON> Silkoff </PERSON> from taking office. <PERSON> Collins </PERSON> said his motion had nothing to do with the candidates' political beliefs, but <PERSON> Rabinowitz </PERSON> contended otherwise `` He's more interested in petty factional politics than the well-being of the whole student government,'' said <PERSON> Rabinowitz </PERSON>, a 20-year-old junior from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Rabinowitz </PERSON> and <PERSON> Silkoff </PERSON>, also 20, won 1,454 votes, 391 more than conservative candidate <PERSON> Aram </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamparian </PERSON>, at the 19,000-student campus.

 The investment banking firm <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> came under attack during a congressional hearing for what one senator said was its role as a corporate raider in a hostile takeover. `` In effect, what we have is a bank acting as a corporate raider,'' Sen. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Sasser </PERSON>, D-Tenn., said Monday at a hearing of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> The committee met for three hours on the attempted takeover of Pittsburgh-based <ORGANIZATION> Koppers </ORGANIZATION> by <ORGANIZATION> Beazer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, which is being advised by <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION>. `` Shearson is only the first to cross a line that Wall Street believes will be obliterated by others racing across it in the future,'' said Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Heinz </PERSON>, R-Pa., referring to the distinction between banking and commerce <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolitzer </PERSON>, managing director of <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION>, said the firm's role was limited to providing short-term, or `` bridge,'' financing for <ORGANIZATION> Beazer </ORGANIZATION>'s tender offer and giving advice. Such financing is `` typical for investment banks in deals of this kind,'' he said. <PERSON> Wolitzer </PERSON> acknowledged that <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> is contributing equity of its own _ $ 23 million _ to the bidding group, but he said management and control of the group would be held by <ORGANIZATION> Beazer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION>. But <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pullin </PERSON>, chairman and chief executive officer of <ORGANIZATION> Koppers </ORGANIZATION>, said <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> `` has dominated and actively guided every aspect of the planning and execution of the <ORGANIZATION> Koppers </ORGANIZATION> takeover attempt since its secret initiation one year ago.'' <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Beazer </PERSON>, chairman and chief executive officer of the British company, defended the takeover attempt, saying his company's goal is `` not to make a quick buck by laying off employees, and selling the company's operations piecemeal.'' `` I am not a corporate raider,'' <ORGANIZATION> Beazer </ORGANIZATION> said. He said <ORGANIZATION> Koppers </ORGANIZATION>' management has mounted `` a massive campaign of disinformation'' about his bid <ORGANIZATION> Beazer </ORGANIZATION> led a group that made an unsolicited cash tender offer of $ 45 a share for <ORGANIZATION> Koppers </ORGANIZATION> on March 3, a deal that has since been sweetened to $ 60 per share, or $ 1.7 billion. <ORGANIZATION> Koppers </ORGANIZATION> produces construction materials and chemicals. `` From an <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> viewpoint, not only do we think this to be a <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> transaction and activity in the normal course of its business, but we also view the uproar by some allies of <ORGANIZATION> Koppers </ORGANIZATION> as ill-informed, provocative and ill-advised,'' said <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Freeman </PERSON>, executive vice president of <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION>'s parent. He said it was ill-informed because of the `` continued erroneous assertion that somehow <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION>, rather than <ORGANIZATION> Beazer </ORGANIZATION>, is trying to acquire <ORGANIZATION> Koppers </ORGANIZATION>, which is simply not true and strikes the management of <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> as a bizarre allegation.'' <ORGANIZATION> Beazer </ORGANIZATION>'s offer has been extended until April 15 while courts consider legal challenges by <ORGANIZATION> Koppers </ORGANIZATION> that have slowed the takeover bid.

 Democrat <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> celebrated his cousin's Academy Award and, with his eye on <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s important presidential primary, said `` I hope it's an omen for next week. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> talked to cousin <PERSON> Olympia </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> by telephone Monday night shortly after she won an Oscar for her supporting role in the movie `` Moonstruck.'' The <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor made his call from a <LOCATION> Greenwich </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Village </LOCATION> restaurant that figured in the movie and was decorated with photos and posters from it. Dining on pasta and lamb chops, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> watched a videotaped replay of his cousin's award and clapped when she waved her statuette and said, `` OK, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON>, let's go!'' He had just seen the movie the night before. `` You're fantastic, you're unbelievable,'' he gushed on the telephone. `` You're radiant. ... I'm so happy for you.'' `` What are we doing here, you and I, just a couple of street kids?'' he asked. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, the front-runner for the Democratic nomination, had been saying all afternoon as he campaigned around <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> that an Oscar victory could be a harbinger for his presidential candidacy in next Tuesday's primary. `` I hope it's an omen for next week,'' he said. `` I hope it's a good sign for the ` <PERSON> Dukaki </PERSON>' _ all of them.'' Earlier in the day, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> bid for Jewish support and sided with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> in blaming <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> leaders for violence in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>. He found no fault with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s policies or use of force in dealing with Palestinian uprisings, but he also absolved the young <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> protesters, saying they have been misled by their leaders. `` It is critically important that the world understand who is responsible for the turmoil and the violence,'' he told the <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Presidents </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Major </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jewish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organizations </ORGANIZATION>. `` It is not the generation of young Palestinians who have grown up in uncertainty.'' he said. `` It is not a government in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> that struggles to maintain order. ... It is, regrettably, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> leaders themselves, who have time and again rejected the chance to sit down with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and negotiate a permanent peace in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' appearance before the group of leaders from 44 major national Jewish organizations was an effort to attract support from Jews, who make up some one-quarter of the Democratic primary electorate in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, where the state's huge delegate prize is at stake next Tuesday. Rival <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> appeared before the group earlier, drawing a distinction with <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> in opposing a letter signed by 30 senators urging Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> to press <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to come to a peaceful resolution of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> violence. Leaders of the group said Democrat <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, who has drawn opposition from some Jews for his 1984 reference to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> as `` Hymietown,'' declined an invitation. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> faced questions that appeared to challenge him to go further in drawing distinctions between himself and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, including one questioner who called <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> an `` anti-Semite.'' Others pressed him to state opposition to creation of an independent <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> state _ which <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> refused to do, saying that was a matter for <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and its neighbors to negotiate. He was also asked to state a position on the future of <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> initially said <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> too was `` subject to negotiation.'' He later told reporters, however, that `` I'm for a united <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>'' under Israeli control. `` Always have been,'' he said. He said <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> `` will remain the capital and should remain the capital'' of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> refused to be drawn into a personal characterization of <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> on the Jewish issue. But he cited several differences with <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, such as <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s call for returning corporate taxes to 1980 levels, and in general on the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> also spoke to a large gathering of supporters at an evening rally on <LOCATION> Staten </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>. He urged them to ignore polls showing him ahead, saying he lost his 1978 re-election bid despite a lead of as much as 50 points in polls. `` I've learned from that experience,'' he said.

 An indigent art historian says he could n't afford to present his side of the case before he was convicted of transporting stolen historic documents, including letters from <PERSON> Abraham </PERSON> <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> and <PERSON> Winston </PERSON> <PERSON> Churchill </PERSON>. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Merrill </PERSON> <PERSON> Mount </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION> native who affects the accent and manners of a British gentleman, says he will appeal Monday's conviction for transporting goods belonging to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Archives </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Library </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> `` This was not a trial. It was only a hearing of government allegations,'' said Mount. `` A trial is when both sides present their case. It did not happen here. ... The government wanted a conviction and they got a conviction.'' The 59-year-old historian and author faces up to 10 years in prison and a $ 500,000 fine when he is sentenced in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Court. He was released on $ 50,000 bail pending sentencing May 23. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> McGinty </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION>'s public defender, said he will appeal on grounds that the court should have paid transportation costs for two Irish men <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> wanted as defense witnesses. Mount, whose $ 18,400 in savings was seized by the government following the arrest, claimed his status as indigent required prosecutors to pay to bring witnesses to <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>. At issue were 166 documents, including letters by <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON>, <PERSON> Churchill </PERSON>, artist <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> McNeill </PERSON> <PERSON> Whistler </PERSON> and author <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> James </PERSON>, that allegedly belonged to the Library of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> but were sold by Mount to <ORGANIZATION> Goodspeed </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Book </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shop </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> for about $ 20,000 in July. Mount, a respected art historian and former <ORGANIZATION> Guggenheim </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> fellow, said he owned the documents for years, and showed some of them to the two Irish men, including the president of a national art academy, in the 1960s in <LOCATION> Dublin </LOCATION>. The government said Mount gained access to the documents last May and July. <PERSON> Goodspeed </PERSON>'s officials had contacted the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> after the first transaction with Mount. Only one witness appeared for the defense during the three-week trial, a <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION> woman who met Mount in a hotel in <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> in 1961 and said she saw some documents. She paid her fare to <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>. The jury deliberated four hours Friday and met for 2 -LCB- hours Monday before returning the verdict. Mount also was indicted on possession of federal property charges by a grand jury in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> McNamara </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, said he did not know if federal prosecutors would pursue those possession charges. <PERSON> Claire </PERSON> <PERSON> Rochefort </PERSON>, a manuscript director at <ORGANIZATION> Goodspeed </ORGANIZATION>'s who purchased the documents from <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION>, is pleased the documents may return to the National Archives. `` They are part of our national heritage,'' said <PERSON> Rochefort </PERSON>. `` We would like to be reimbursed, but to get the documents back is the most important thing.'' Mount, who changed his name from <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> <PERSON> Merrill </PERSON> <PERSON> Suchow </PERSON> in the 1950s, said he will return to his room in a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> boarding house.

But by the early 1970s, their popularity had waned, and in 1981, <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> and <PERSON> Prater </PERSON> broke up. <PERSON> Prater </PERSON> revived the <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> act in 1982 with a new partner, <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Daniels </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Daniels </PERSON> said he saw <PERSON> Prater </PERSON> the Sunday before he died when they performed together in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>. `` I still feel a little shocked,'' he said Monday night. <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> gained further popularity when the <ORGANIZATION> Blues </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION> of `` Saturday Night Live'' fame, <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Ackroyd </PERSON> and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Belushi </PERSON>, had a hit with `` Soul Man.'' Lately, <PERSON> Prater </PERSON> had run into trouble with drugs, although Mrs. <PERSON> Prater </PERSON> said he seemed to have the problem beat. <PERSON> Prater </PERSON> was arrested last summer in <LOCATION> Paterson </LOCATION> for selling a vial of crack to an undercover police officer.

<HEAD>Air Force Reverses Decision To Close 37 Units</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> says its decision against closing or consolidating 37 <ORGANIZATION> ROTC </ORGANIZATION> units across the country also will mean a delay in its efforts to save more than $ 10 million a year on that program. In a letter to Sen. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> said that while the decision will delay anticipated savings, the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> secretary `` is sensitive to the impact of the prior decision for closure-consolidation.'' The decision to cut the programs would be reviewed again at the end of the spring term of 1990, but plans would go forward to reduce the number of AFROTC commissioned officers by 15 percent over the next two years, according to the letter from Lt. Col. <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Titus </PERSON>, a legislative liaison officer. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, wrote in January to <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Aldridge </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> to complain the closures would have a disproportionate impact on <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, `` a state with a long and proud tradition of military service which has also welcomed military activities.'' <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> stood to lose more ROTC units than any other states if the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> had gone through with its plans, announced in January, to close 30 of its 151 <ORGANIZATION> ROTC </ORGANIZATION> units and consolidate another seven with nearby schools. Both states would have lost four programs each. The <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> said in a letter Monday to <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> that the move would have cut 200 positions and saved more than $ 10 million annually. The armed services are searching for $ 32.9 billion of spending cuts in fiscal 1989, which begins Oct. 1, to comply with budget limits established in November in a deficit-reduction plan. `` Without a steady inflow of bright, energetic younger officers _ particularly from the <ORGANIZATION> AFROTC </ORGANIZATION> units _ the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> may lose some of its vigor and diversity,'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said in his letter. The <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> had planned to phase in the closures over 18 months to allow 1,197 juniors and seniors in the 37 affected programs to complete their studies. The affected units, where young officers are groomed for active service, have a current four-year enrollment of 4,448. Lt. Col. <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Dalby </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, said the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> withdrew its plans after determining the criteria to identify units targeted for closure or consolidation had not been spelled out to the schools involved. `` They did not know the criteria they would be judged by,'' <PERSON> Dalby </PERSON> said. `` The decision was unfair without knowing how they were being looked at. The issue we dealt with was primarily fairness.'' `` We believe a two-year postponement of our efforts to close or consolidate AFROTC units will provide sufficient notice to affected units as well as their host colleges and universities,'' The <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> released a statement saying that although many of the AFROTC programs marked for closure were performing well under AFROTC standards, `` they were identified as being the least cost-effective AFROTC programs under new criteria developed for the closure plan.''

<HEAD>Senate Moving Toward Approval of $1.1 Trillion Federal Budget</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDS: Senate resumes debate 11:30 a.m. EDT; top planned</NOTE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> is moving toward approval of a $ 1.1 trillion federal budget for fiscal 1989 that some lawmakers say does more to mask the size of the government's enormous deficit than it does to slash it. <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> leaders predicted that despite those reservations the chamber could approve the spending plan as early as today. The proposal, which has received rare bipartisan support, cleared its first procedural hurdle Monday when senators voted 83-0 to begin debating the budget resolution. The fiscal 1989 blueprint estimates a deficit of $ 136 billion, precisely the target set by the Gramm-Rudman balanced budget law for the next fiscal year, which begins Oct. 1. This year's deficit is expected to reach $ 146.7 billion. But helping to keep the red ink down is a $ 46 billion surplus the Social Security system is expected to amass next year. Even though that money is being built up in anticipation of retirements by the baby boomers in the early 21st century _ and can not be used for anything else _ the annual surpluses were included in the budget's arithmetic and make the deficit look smaller. In addition, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, like the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, relied on an optimistic administration economic forecast to arrive at its projected deficit. Had the lawmakers used the less cheerful projections of their own <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>, the red ink would have been $ 35 billion higher. `` We need to quit fooling ourselves in talking about a $ 136 billion deficit,'' Sen. <PERSON> Lawton </PERSON> <PERSON> Chiles </PERSON>, chairman of the budget committee, said during debate. `` It's just not correct.'' <PERSON> Chiles </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Fla </LOCATION>., planned to introduce an amendment that would urge <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to stop using Social Security surpluses in calculating the deficit Other amendments were anticipated to shift money among several domestic programs. But the main fights that normally dominate budget debates _ how to balance domestic and military spending, and whether to raise taxes _ are not present this year. Those questions were settled last fall, when President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and congressional leaders reached their so-called budget summit agreement. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> budget resolution obeys the summit agreement's limits in calling for $ 294 billion in military spending next year, $ 16.1 billion for foreign assistance and $ 169.2 billion for domestic programs in which spending is not set by automatic formulas. In addition, there will be no new taxes beyond the $ 14 billion called for in the summit and already enacted into law. `` I do n't think we can afford this year to breach the summit agreement,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Domenici </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, ranking Republican on the budget panel. `` I think we ought to enforce it, and I think we've done that rather well.'' With the major fights out of the way, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> passed its version of the budget resolution March 23 on a bipartisan 319-102 vote. In that chamber, as in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, lawmakers have some significant differences with the domestic priorities <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> set in the budget he submitted to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in February. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> proposal does not eliminate or severely slash a series of federal mass transit and economic development programs, as <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> wanted. It also calls for about $ 1 billion more than <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> did for <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION>. But, in line with <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> recommendations, it would increase spending for AIDS research, education, space, science and drug enforcement. The budget resolution does not require the president's signature, but the two chambers must agree on an identical version before it takes effect The document will be used later as a blueprint by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> when it passes bills that actually provide the money for federal agencies.

 `` No one should feel bad about my going. I'm not worth it,'' begins one of the 1,200 suicide notes collected by a Canadian psychologist who will be honored this week for his pioneering study of fatal last words. The note was left by a middle-aged <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> man who shot himself after an unhappy love affair, said Dr. <PERSON> Antoons </PERSON> <PERSON> Leenaars </PERSON>, 37, of <LOCATION> Windsor </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ontario </LOCATION>. Collected from coroners' offices and bereaved loved ones, the notes provide the raw material the Dutch-born psychotherapist is analyzing to determine why people take their own lives and how they might be saved. `` We're looking for the common factors so that we can predict -LRB- suicide attempts -RRB- and intervene in those cases where the person might want us to intervene,'' he said in an interview. `` A long time ago I learned that you can help some and not others.'' On Friday, <PERSON> Leenaars </PERSON> will become only the second non-American to receive the Edwin Shneidman Award, established by a former <ORGANIZATION> UCLA </ORGANIZATION> professor to encourage research into suicide. The award will be presented at a convention of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Suicidology </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C </LOCATION>. Eight out of 10 people contemplate suicide, but only those who can not bear the pain go through with it, <PERSON> Leenaars </PERSON> said. About 15 percent leave a note, `` the ultimate personal document.'' With the help of a computer, <PERSON> Leenaars </PERSON> has identified eight classifications of suicides, based on what people write in their notes. They range from tunnel vision to paranoia, failed interpersonal relations and explosive anger turned on themselves. Some hurt so bad `` they just want to stop consciousness,'' while others use suicide to express a bewildering ambivalence about life: `` Not only do they hate, and love, someone but they want to live and not live. `` The common stimulus in all suicides is unbearable psychological pain,'' said <PERSON> Leenaars </PERSON>, who works with school boards and public groups on suicide prevention and has written a book, `` Suicide Notes,'' scheduled for August publication. <PERSON> Leenaars </PERSON> said a note left by a 75-year-old woman in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> made him cry. Before death by suffocation she wrote: `` <PERSON> Martha </PERSON>, I'm heartsick First Grandma, then <PERSON> Bill </PERSON>, then my home, my car, my eyesight, now my apartment ... Love, <PERSON> Mary </PERSON>. Thanks for everything to everyone.'' A 13-year-old boy, disappointed in love, left this note before ending his life: `` I know what I'm doing. <PERSON> Annette </PERSON>, I found out. Ask <PERSON> Carol </PERSON>. I love you all, <PERSON> Bill </PERSON>.'' An 18-year-old married man shot himself and told those left behind: `` Life is n't worth the bother.'' One note said: `` No one is to blame. P.S. Happy Father's Day.'' Another man, unable to control his obsessive perfectionism, killed himself because his <ORGANIZATION> Ferrari </ORGANIZATION> got scratched, <PERSON> Leenaars </PERSON> said. The doctor believes suicides are underreported since many coroners require a note before making that ruling. Even so, official rates in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> tripled in the third quarter of this century with the highest toll in the 18 to 25 age bracket. In 1981, there were 12.9 suicides in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> and 12.7 in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for every 100,000 people. The highest rate reported to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> that year was <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> with 59.9 while <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION> reported 0.2. Far more men than women kill themselves. For every 100,000 North Americans, about 20 men and six women commit suicide. `` It's really concerning,'' said <PERSON> Leenaars </PERSON>. `` Men may need to be liberated -LRB- from -RRB- the macho image.'' Married with two small children, <PERSON> Leenaars </PERSON> became interested in the topic after a high school friend whose parents were separated died in a suspected suicide. `` I felt I did n't understand, I could n't help.'' Most victims give clues beforehand and therapists, families and workmates can intervene if they recognize the signals, he said. `` When people talk, you should listen,'' <PERSON> Leenaars </PERSON> said. `` Watch out for the person who's always been sad who is suddenly happy. And suicide threats should always be taken seriously.''

 <PERSON> Cher </PERSON> won the Oscar as best actress Monday night for her role as a widow who discovers love in `` Moonstruck,'' while `` The Last Emperor,'' a tragic epic of modern <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, became the most-honored film in 26 years with nine awards, including best picture. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> was named best actor at the 60th Academy Awards for his portrayal of a ruthless inside trader in `` Wall Street.'' Best supporting performers were <PERSON> Olympia </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, as <PERSON> Cher </PERSON>'s outspoken Italian mother coping with a wayward husband in `` Moonstruck,'' and <PERSON> Sean </PERSON> <PERSON> Connery </PERSON>, the hard-fisted, incorruptible <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> beat cop in `` The Untouchables. `` When I was a little girl, my mother said, ` I really want you to be something,''' <PERSON> Cher </PERSON> told the cheering crowd at the Shrine Auditorium. `` ... I do n't think this means I am somebody, but I guess I am on my way.'' The actress, known for outlandish fashions as well as talent, wore a see-through sequined dress that was somewhat less revealing than her notorious headdress outfit of two years ago. `` Emperor,'' the sweeping story of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s last imperial ruler, won in all nine categories for which it was nominated by the <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Picture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arts </ORGANIZATION> and Sciences: best film, best director for <PERSON> Bernardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Bertolucci </PERSON>, screenplay adaptation, costumes, original score, art direction, cinematography, sound and editing. That gave it more Oscars than any movie since `` West Side Story'' took home 10 in 1962. `` Ben-Hur'' holds the record for 11 in 1960. In the 1959 awards, the musical `` Gigi'' also swept nine Oscars out of nine nominations. It was a night of few surprises but some awkwardness, with the shadow of a strike by movie and TV writers falling heavily on the proceedings. There were numerous references, some joking, some serious, to the labor dispute, and on several occasions performers appeared to stumble over their remarks. <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON>, who also starred in last year's box-office smash `` Fatal Attraction,'' thanked his father, actor <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON> <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON>, `` for helping a son step out from his shadow.'' <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON>' award was presented by <PERSON> Marlee </PERSON> <PERSON> Matlin </PERSON>, a deaf actress who won last year's Oscar. She has been taking speech lessons, and after signing her opening remarks she haltingly named all the nominees to prolonged cheers. The actress category had sparked the most interest this year, with <PERSON> Cher </PERSON> drawing strong competition from <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> <PERSON> Close </PERSON> in `` Fatal Attraction'' and <PERSON> Sally </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirkland </PERSON> in `` <PERSON> Anna </PERSON>.'' Also nominated were <PERSON> Holly </PERSON> <PERSON> Hunter </PERSON> for `` Broadcast News'' and two-time winner <PERSON> Meryl </PERSON> <PERSON> Streep </PERSON> for `` Ironweed.'' <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Shanley </PERSON>'s script for `` Moonstruck'' won for best original screenplay, making that film a distant runner-up to `` Emperor'' with three Oscars. <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION>'s `` Babette's Feast'' was best foreign film. `` As an Italian, a European, the Academy Awards always seemed like a distant ceremony: Distant, remote, something I did not belong to,'' <PERSON> Bertolucci </PERSON> told the audience. He was introduced by <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, who jokingly said the academy was offering this year's winner a `` green card,'' a reference to the fact that none of the five director nominees was American. `` OK, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON>, let's go!'' a jubilant Miss <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> whooped after accepting the gold statuette. The reference was to her cousin, <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, who is seeking the Democratic nomination for president. <PERSON> Connery </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION>'s original <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Bond </PERSON>, addressed his acceptance to `` Ladies and gentlemen, friends, a few enemies,'' and put in a fervent plea for an end to the writers' strike. The best original movie song of 1987 was `` The Time of My Life'' from `` Dirty Dancing.'' The first prize of the night, for best visual effects, went to `` Innerspace,'' a <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Spielberg-produced </PERSON> fantasy about a test pilot reduced to microscopic size and accidentally injected into the body of a grocery clerk. The award for best animated short film went to `` The Man Who Planted Trees.'' `` Young at Heart'' was best documentary short subject and `` The Ten-Year Lunch: The Wit and Wisdom of the Algonquin Roundtable'' was best documentary feature. Best live action short film was `` Ray's Male Heterosexual Dance Hall.'' The award for makeup went to `` <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> and the <ORGANIZATION> Hendersons </ORGANIZATION>.'' More than 1,000 movie fans had packed bleachers hours in advance to cheer celebrities arriving for the ceremonies, which were broadcast live by <ORGANIZATION> ABC-TV </ORGANIZATION> with <PERSON> Chevy </PERSON> <PERSON> Chase </PERSON> as host.

 The move from the <ORGANIZATION> Music </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> to the Shrine meant far more limousines than usual pulling up before the six 24-foot Oscars guarding the auditorium entrance. `` Last year at the Music Center we had 3,000 people,'' said <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldwyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, producer of the Oscar show for the second year. `` This year we have 6,000.'' But apparently there was n't enough room for the Oscarcast orcestra at the cavernous Shrine. The musicians were housed on a sound stage five miles away in <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> and would offer their `` live'' fanfares and movie themes via phone lines to giant speakers in the auditorium. Producer <PERSON> Goldwyn </PERSON> faced a special problem this year: the strike by the <ORGANIZATION> Writers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guild </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> against the motion picture and television producers. Much of the script had been written before the strike was called, but the guild refused to grant a waiver for the work to be completed. The Guild had also warned that non-members who write for the show might face rejection if they ever wanted to join the <ORGANIZATION> WGA </ORGANIZATION>. The 60th awards marked a first in press coverage: the <LOCATION> U.S.S.R. </LOCATION> was represented. Photographer <PERSON> Nikolai </PERSON> <PERSON> Gnisyuk </PERSON> of the Soviet Screen magazine -LRB- circulation: 2 million -RRB- was accredited to join the mass of media backstage. `` We journalists and photographers in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> are amazed that such a fuss is made over these awards,'' said <PERSON> Gnisyuk </PERSON> before the ceremonies. `` That is, we understand the importance of the awards to the industry, but all this mania is just incredible. It's as if someone were running for national election.'' One major award was already known: <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON> for the <PERSON> Irving </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Thalberg </PERSON> award for consistent quality of production. <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON> has already received six Oscars for his work as writer, director and producer, his films including `` The Lost Weekend,'' `` <LOCATION> Sunset </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Boulevard </LOCATION>,'' `` Some Like It Hot'' and `` The Apartment.'' Unlike <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Hitchcock </PERSON>, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Ford </PERSON> and other filmmakers with distinctive styles, <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON>'s films do n't easily fit a pattern. `` I'm just a storyteller,'' <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON> once remarked. `` Technique is secondary to me.''

 <PERSON> Cher </PERSON>, who first gained fame as the long-haired singing sidekick to a straight man named <PERSON> Sonny </PERSON> <PERSON> Bono </PERSON>, took home the best actress Oscar Monday night for her performance as the superstitious young widow of `` Moonstruck.'' `` I want to really say something,'' she said, upon accepting the award. `` When I was little my mother said, ` I want you to be something,' and I guess this represents 23 or 24 years of my work, and I've never won anything before from my peers. I'm really, really happy.'' The actress was dressed in a somewhat less revealing gown than her sensational headdress and bare-belly contraption of two years ago. But this year's outfit was far from modest _ a black sequined gown with see-through netting around the torso that was covered strategically by a thick black cape. As she left her seat to come on stage, the audience stood and applauded, and <PERSON> Cher </PERSON> was hugged by <PERSON> Olympia </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, who won the best supporting actress award for playing her mother in `` Moonstruck.'' Oscar in hand, <PERSON> Cher </PERSON> thanked <PERSON> Meryl </PERSON> <PERSON> Streep </PERSON>, who also had been nominated for `` Ironweed,'' and <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Streep </PERSON>, who starred with <PERSON> Cher </PERSON> in 1983's `` Silkwood,'' answered from the audience by blowing kisses. `` I do n't think that this means that I am somebody, but I guess I'm on my way,'' <PERSON> Cher </PERSON> said in closing. She had been nominated in a supporting role for `` Silkwood'' but did not win. Earlier, <PERSON> Bono </PERSON>, who is seeking election as mayor of <LOCATION> Palm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION> in a Tuesday election, said he was sure <PERSON> Cher </PERSON> would win. `` I had this vision,'' <PERSON> Bono </PERSON> said. `` This incredible thought occurred to me. <PERSON> Cher </PERSON>'s going to win the Academy Award. I called her yesterday. I said, ` <PERSON> Cher </PERSON>, you're going to win.' She said, ` From your mouth to God's ear.''' It's been 23 years since the bell-bottomed, furry-vested rock couple hit the top of the record charts singing `` I've Got You Babe,'' and 14 years since both their television show and marriage hit the rocks. `` Would n't it be fun if she won the Academy Award and I was elected mayor?'' <PERSON> Bono </PERSON> asked. Nominated for best actress with <PERSON> Cher </PERSON> and Miss Streep were <PERSON> Holly </PERSON> <PERSON> Hunter </PERSON> for `` Broadcast News,'' <PERSON> Sally </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirkland </PERSON> for `` Anna'' and <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> <PERSON> Close </PERSON>, `` Fatal Attraction.''

 A community activist who founded a city youth center and has been a foster parent to 21 children was charged with sexually assaulting two teen-age boys in his care, authorities said. A grand jury on Monday indicted the Rev. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> J </PERSON>. Hall, 41, of suburban <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Holland </LOCATION>, on 16 counts of criminal sexual assault and eight counts of aggravated criminal sexual abuse. Hall surrendered late Monday and was released after posting 10 percent of a $ 25,000 bond, said <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Holland </LOCATION> police spokeswoman <PERSON> Georgianna </PERSON> <PERSON> Musket </PERSON>. He will plead innocent to the charges, said his attorney, <PERSON> Brent </PERSON> <PERSON> Stratton </PERSON>. Hall, a non-denominational clergyman, attracted widespread attention through food giveaways and other community programs run out of a storefront headquarters on <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Side </LOCATION>. Since beginning the giveaways in 1980, he has kept a 25-day fast each Christmas. The assaults on the two boys, now ages 15 and 16, occurred from mid-1986 through last fall, when <PERSON> Hall </PERSON> was a foster parent to six children at his home, said <ORGANIZATION> Cook </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION>'s Attorney <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Daley </PERSON>. `` The evidence clearly shows that the Reverend <PERSON> Hall </PERSON> betrayed the trust of these two children,'' <PERSON> Daley </PERSON> said. In January, <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Holland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> Chief <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Smits </PERSON> said <PERSON> Hall </PERSON> had called <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> police to report that a 15-year-old foster child had run away. The teen-ager, found at <LOCATION> O'Hare </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>, made allegations of abuse, <PERSON> Smits </PERSON> said. The six children living with <PERSON> Hall </PERSON> were removed from his supervision. Hall has been a foster parent for the state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Children </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Family </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> since 1979 and has cared for 21 foster children, said department spokeswoman <PERSON> Jo </PERSON> <PERSON> Warfield </PERSON>. The agency had received no complaints about Hall before, said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>, chief of internal investigations for the agency. `` How did he slip through the cracks? If we knew that, we could solve the problem,'' said <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>. `` You ca n't just stop every act. We continue to look at and review what went wrong and hope we can close up that crack.'' Hall founded the <ORGANIZATION> Paul </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boys </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> in the 1960s. He later branched out into other youth-oriented programs, such as a 24-hour hotline for gang members seeking to go straight. Hall also established drop-off centers for gang members who wanted to turn in weapons. <PERSON> Daley </PERSON> said the charges are not connected to <PERSON> Hall </PERSON>'s youth center, which admits girls and boys. The club is not associated with the <ORGANIZATION> Boys </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Girls </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> or its national affiliate, the <ORGANIZATION> Boys </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Clubs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Daley </PERSON> said allegations concerning other children in <PERSON> Hall </PERSON>'s care are being investigated. Ms. <PERSON> Warfield </PERSON> said her agency is taking steps to lift <PERSON> Hall </PERSON>'s license to be a foster parent. Hall is to be arraigned May 2. If convicted of all the charges, he could be sentenced to 296 years in prison.

<HEAD>Draft Letter Suggests Flexibility On Birth Control</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A draft letter on women written by <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> bishops suggests that the church be more responsive toward the large numbers of <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> women who practice artificial contraception despite a church ban. The letter, released Monday, reasserted church teachings that birth control by artificial means is wrong. But it also said, `` It is essential that we foster a dialogue between those who find prohibitions against artificial contraception unacceptable and those who find that the natural regulation of births has enriched and preserved their marriage.'' The 164-page letter breaks little new ground on women's role in the church but does condemn sexism and urges priests to be more sensitive to women's concerns. The document recommended that women play more of a leadership role in the church and suggests further study of the possibility of installing women as permanent deacons. It also said girls should be allowed to join altar boys in assisting priests, saying that exclusion of girls seems `` to stand in contradiction to our call for women's more direct involvement in the life of the church.'' However, the bishops stopped short of recommending that women be ordained as priests. On birth control, the draft acknowledged that `` there is a wide gap between what the church teaches about artificial contraception and the actual practice of many Catholic women.'' `` Consulting with women on matters pertaining to birth control will contribute to church teaching on sexuality,'' the draft said. `` Women's experience will lead to the formulation of better policies and preparation for family planning that can be more widely communicated to engaged and married couples. `` We especially encourage a spirit of compassion towards those who in good conscience who have not lived in accord with the ideals set forth by the church.'' The draft of the pastoral letter, titled `` Partners in the Mystery of Redemption, A Pastoral Response to Women's <ORGANIZATION> Concerns </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>,'' will be circulated among Catholics in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, with responses due Dec. 1. A final draft is expected to be presented to the full body of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bishops in November 1989 and, if approved, would become part of Catholic teachings. The draft was issued more than five years after church authorities began a study of women in the church. <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Brabeck </PERSON>, associate professor of educational psychology at <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>, who helped prepare the draft letter, said she thought the significance of the document was that `` women are being listened to, their experiences are being listened to.'' Sister <PERSON> Sara </PERSON> <PERSON> Butler </PERSON> of the Missionary Servants of the Most Blessed Trinity in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, said that the letter was `` definitely trying to address male attitudes, and particularly male clerical attitudes.'' The pastoral letter, in fact, chastises some priests and counselors in the church who fail to show understanding for divorced women. `` Some of us as well as priests, religious and laity need to overcome the fear or prejudice that causes them to shun those whose marriages have led to divorce or ended in annulment,'' the letter said. At another point, the letter said: `` A frequently voiced concern is that those to whom women turn for help do not have the training, sensitivity or experience necessary to address concretely what it is like to be a mother, pursue a career, seek just wages and be vigilant in regard to sexual violence.''

<HEAD>``The Last Emperor'' Sweeps Nine of Nine Nominations</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 As expected, `` The Last Emperor'' swept the 60th Academy Awards ceremony Monday night, taking Oscars in each of its nine nominated categories including direction and Best Picture. `` I must give a Chinese kow-tow to the Academy. This is one of the strongest emotions of my life, and I ca n't hide it,'' said <PERSON> Bernardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Bertolucci </PERSON>, who directed the epic about <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s boy ruler <PERSON> Pu </PERSON> <PERSON> Yi </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bertolucci </PERSON> took the Oscar for best director, the first Italian director to win in this category. The film also won for art direction, cinematography, sound, film editing, original score, costume design, adapted screenplay and picture. It was the most Oscars won by a single movie since 1962, when `` West Side Story'' took 10 awards. The record is held by the 1959 `` Ben-Hur,'' which won 11. Producer <PERSON> Jeremy </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> accepted the best picture award saying, `` I must say this is certainly an imperial evening for me.'' <PERSON> Bertolucci </PERSON> thanked <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> for allowing him to shoot there. The director amazed the film industry by winning permission to shoot a movie with political overtones in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and to take cameras into the fabled <LOCATION> Forbidden </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, the shrine of Chinese history. The logistics of the film's production included actors from six nations, and 19,000 extras who played the soldiers of the People's <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> It was <PERSON> Bertolucci </PERSON>'s second nomination for directing, the first being for `` Last Tango in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>'' in 1973. He also received a writing nomination for his screenplay of `` The Conformist'' in 1971. `` As an Italian, a European, the Acadeny Awards always seemed like a distant ceremony: Distant, remote, something I did not belong to,'' <PERSON> Bertolucci </PERSON> told the Shrine Auditorium audience. `` Then one day `` The Last Emperor'' got nine nominations and everything changed immediately,'' he said. Asked backstage about the lack of acting nominations for the picture, <PERSON> Bertolucci </PERSON> said, `` This is a democratic election, so what can I say?''

<HEAD>Maryland Legislature Approves Saturday Night Special Ban</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ANNAPOLIS, Md. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The first state law in the nation to ban the sale of cheap handguns known as Saturday Night Specials cleared the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> and was sent to the governor, who has promised to sign it. Despite a fierce lobbying effort by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rifle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, the bill was passed Monday night with support from top state officials and <PERSON> Sarah </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>, wife of <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>, President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s press secretary. Mrs. <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> told legislators at an earlier hearing that a $ 29 handgun that would be banned under the <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> law was used by <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Hinckley </PERSON> in his 1981 assassination attempt that wounded the president and left husband partially disabled. <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Speaker <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Clayton </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> said the 95-41 vote in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Delegates </ORGANIZATION> a few hours before the 1988 legislative session ended `` seems to be a first, a giant step forward.'' `` I'm hoping <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> will look at what <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> did,'' said Attorney General <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Curran </PERSON>. `` That's where this action is needed `` It's been a long time but unfortunately it seems like as the list of victims grows'' it becomes easier to pass gun control legislation, he said. Gov. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Schaefer </PERSON>, who helped move the bill through the legislature, said he will sign it into law unless he finds some unexpected legal flaws. <ORGANIZATION> NRA </ORGANIZATION> lobbyists gave up their fight after watching the bill sail through the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> on a 35-10 vote Saturday, but <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Cunningham </PERSON>, state liaison for the association, said he will be back to renew the fight next year. `` I just hope it's not a trend-setting thing where a lot of states start setting up boards,'' <PERSON> Cunningham </PERSON> said after the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> vote. The bill directs the governor to create a state <ORGANIZATION> Handgun </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Roster </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> headed by the state police superintendent. The nine-member board will prepare a list of guns that can be sold in <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> and will be required to withhold approval of: _ Guns that are inaccurate, poorly made, easily concealed and manufactured of cheap materials, characteristics common to the Saturday Night Specials said to be used by drug pushers and other small-time criminals _ Guns made mostly of plastic or ceramic materials that ca n't be readily detected by security systems at airports and public buildings _ Guns in which the manufacturer's serial number has been obliterated or altered The bill prohibits manufacturers, dealers and private individuals from selling any guns not on the list, and provides fines from $ 2,500 to $ 10,000 for violations. It will only be illegal to sell the weapons, not to own them. `` We shifted the burden of proof. We put the onus on gun merchants to justify their guns,'' said state Sen. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Denis </PERSON>, Republican. Four states, <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>, have laws that ban guns based on the melting point of the metal, according to the lobbying group <ORGANIZATION> Handgun </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. Guns with lower melting points are of poorer quality and thus cheaper. However, both the <ORGANIZATION> NRA </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Handgun </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> agreed that no state has a law regulating guns on the basis of inaccuracy, ease of concealment, plastic or ceramic construction or the other characteristics addressed by the <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> law. `` Clearly, this is going to add some impetus to other states considering gun control laws. This is an example we'll be taking to other states,'' said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Beard </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION> to Ban Handguns. The ban on sale of Saturday Night Specials wo n't take effect until Jan. 1, 1990. The board will be required to prepare a list of approved guns by July 1, 1989.

 Here is the conclusion of the draft pastoral letter on women issued Monday by <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> bishops. I give you a new commandment: love one another. As I have loved you, so you also should love one another. This is how all will know that you are my disciples, if you have love for one another -LRB- Jn. 13:34 -35 -RRB- Today is a time of challenge and change for men and women. Each day more barriers to the full recognition of their equality before God fall, more stereotypes crumble, more doors open. Women value the church's recognition that they are a vital force in the world. They embrace the expanded roles open to them since Vatican Council II. They bring knowledge, education, skills, and leadership to both society and the church. For Catholic women the church is home. It is through the church that they worship God, serve others, and seek guidelines for how to live in society in keeping with the full dignity of their calling to be persons and partners, to be the people of God, in an unjust and imperfect world. Like <PERSON> Mary </PERSON>, women refuse to lose courage; they will not give up hope. They believe in the basic thrust of our heritage which holds that we are to `` preserve the unity of the spirit through the bond of peace: One body and one Spirit, ... one Lord, one faith, one baptism; one God and Father of all, who is over all and through all and in all'' -LRB- Eph. 4:3 -5 -RRB-

<BYLINE>Called to Partnership</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 To be faithful to our heritage scripturally and doctrinally means to respect the dignity of each human person, male and female. To follow <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> means to be committed to living out just relationships in the church and in the world. To become the kind of church God invites us to be means to work in solidarity with the poor, the rich, the sinners, with persons of distinction. The mystery of partnership in the church is manifest in our baptismal call to faith and holiness as part of the little flock of Christ -LRB- cf. Lk. 12:32 -RRB-. To live in Christ is the invitation all receive -LRB- cf. Gal. 3:28 -RRB-; to belong to Christ is the central reality in life -LRB- cf. Ph. 3:7 -14 -RRB-; to refuse this vocation as coming from God is the most obstinate sin -LRB- cf Gn. 3 -RRB-. The call to partnership in the church is thus fundamental to our entire heritage. We believe, therefore, that the cooperative mutuality of women and men by virtue of their baptism will more and more become a reality as our understanding of the grace and benefits of partnership grows. Only then can we be freed from the attitudes of fear, anger, and violence that divide and destrroy the Christian community where all are challenged to abide in love -LRB- cf. 1 Jn. 7-12 -RRB-.

 <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> enjoyed caring relationships with women. He healed their physical afflictions -LRB- Mk. 7:24 -30 -RRB- He was compassionate towards the widow of <PERSON> Naim </PERSON> and restored her son to life -LRB- Lk. 7:11 f. He responded to the tears of <PERSON> Martha </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> when he raised <PERSON> Lazarus </PERSON> from the dead -LRB- Jn. 11:1 f. He described God as being like a woman who persists until she finds what was lost, saying, `` Rejoice with me'' -LRB- Lk. 15:8 -10 -RRB- Women ministered to and served with <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> throughout his life. <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Nazareth </LOCATION> accepted a new direction in her life in response to the divine call -LRB- Lk. 1:38 -RRB-; she risked social censure to do God's will. <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> of </PERSON> <PERSON> Bethany </PERSON>, a disciple, listening to <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> with rapt attention, was said to have chosen the better part -LRB- Lk. 10:38 -42 -RRB- Other women ministered with <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> in his daily work of evangelizing and teaching -LRB- Lk. 8:2 -3 -RRB- <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Magdalene </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mary </PERSON>, his mother, remained by him at the cross and anointed his body after death -LRB- Mk. 15:16 -RRB-. Women were discoverers of the empty tomb and first witnesses of the resurrection -LRB- Mt. 28:7 -RRB-. They, too, received the Holy Spirit at Pentecost -LRB- Ac. 1:14 -RRB-; came to the faith eagerly with men -LRB- Ac. 5:14 f -RRB-, and provided homes for the breaking of the bread -LRB- Rm 16:3; 1 Cor. 16:19 -RRB-. Women prophesied -LRB- Ac. 21:9 -RRB- and taught others about <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> -LRB- Ac. 18:26 -RRB-. Likewise they were persecuted and jailed with the men -LRB- Ac. 8:3 -RRB-.

 <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> stands as a model for all Christians of what it means to be a partner with God in the work of salvation. In God's plan, <PERSON> Mary </PERSON>'s free consent was involved in accomplishing the mystery of the Incarnation When <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> said `` Yes,'' the Word was made flesh by the power of God's Spirit. In her response of faith, <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> is the perfect model of a disciple who `` builds up the earthly and temporal city while being a diligent pilgrim towards the heavenly and eternal city, the disciple who works for that justice which sets free the oppressed and for that charity which assists the needy. ... Women and men alike are called to emulate <PERSON> Mary </PERSON>, to imitate her charity and spirit of service. Like her, all are called to hear the word of God and act on it -LRB- Lk. 11:28 -RRB-. Over and above this, <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> is a special symbol for women, for only a woman was God's partner in the Incarnation. God `` entrusted himself to ... the free and active ministry of a woman,'' giving to <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> the Word incarnate. God's plan required the cooperation of a human mother who would conceive, carry, bear, and nurse this Child; a mother who would give the Word real flesh and real blood, a human family and an earthly dwelling place. <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON>, the Incarnate Word, belongs to our race, by the power of the Holy Spirit, because of and through <PERSON> Mary </PERSON>. As <PERSON> Mother </PERSON> <PERSON> of </PERSON> <PERSON> Christ </PERSON>, she is also the mother of the church, who sums up in herself all that the church is.

 Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON>, in his encyclical, <ORGANIZATION> Redemptoris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mater </ORGANIZATION>, affirms that `` women, by looking at <PERSON> Mary </PERSON>, find in her the secret of living their feminity with dignity and of achieving their own true advancement. <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> keeps before the church the virtues women are known for: `` the self-offering totality of love; the strength that is capable of bearing the greatest sorrows; limitless fidelity and tireless devotion to work; the ability to combine penetrating intuition with words of support and encouragement.'' In our times, there is a desire on the part of many to revise devotional representations that appear to propose <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> as a paradigm of passivity and submission to male authority, a woman valued chiefly for her virginity and maternity, a woman confined to domestic and familial roles. Similarly, some lament the fact that <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> has often been presented as so uniquely exalted and gifted, because of her privileges of grace, that she is beyond emulation. Such images do not reflect the gains women have made in terms of equality and co-responsibility. In the face of these concerns, we are reminded by the church that <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> is a woman whose decision led to an event of world importance; a woman of courage who fearlessly entered into God's plan and who followed her Son to the cross; a woman who did not hesitate to challenge injustice, announcing the downfall of the powerful and the vindication of the oppressed Contemporary portraits celebrate <PERSON> Mary </PERSON>'s bond with ordinary women and reflect on her condition as wife, mother, widow; as refugee and displaced person; as woman of an oppressed people; as mother of a prisoner and victim of persecution. <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> is thus not only a model to emulate but an `` active presence in the life of the Church.'' As the first disciple, a woman who entered into partnership with God in the fullest sense, <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> is a sign of hope to all who seek reconciliation with <PERSON> God </PERSON> and with one another.

<BYLINE>Called to Welcome Women's Gifts</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 Women not only continue to carry the bulk of everyday work in the parish; they are also renewing the church's traditions of feminine spirituality as a source of inspiration and growth. Women of scripture and recognized saints are important in their personal and spiritual renewal. Inspiration comes from myriad unnamed women ministering in homes, parishes, and communities, engaged in numerous charitable works, living contemplatively, loving God, and listening obediently to the promptings of the Spirit. Women who love and serve the church call the church in turn to be more responsive to their requests to be involved to a much greater degree in the decisions that most affect their lives in the ecclesial community. While we affirm that the church is neither a democracy nor a political organization, we urge that every effort be made to implement legislation that encourages such involvement, to appoint more women in administrative positions, and in general to create an atmosphere in the church that welcomes women's gifts at every level of participation. With this kind of cooperation, the church will certainly go forward in its mission to enable women and men to be partners in the mystery of redemption.

<BYLINE>Called to Implement Our Recommendations</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 Having written these words, we must see to it that the church, on the national, diocesan and parochial level, enables this letter to come to life. The dialogue between women and men must continue to be expanded so that our recommendations become part of the living heritage of our <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> people and our institutions. Implementation is essential, for ours must not be a counterfeit love of formal politeness, impersonal tolerance or empty words. Like Christ, we must listen first to the will of God speaking in the deepest recesses of our hearts. Thus having heard the word, we must respond with imagination and courage to eradicate the injustice which keeps us from the full stature of Christ. We see in this pastoral response only a beginning, a reminder of ideals, a contact with experience and reality yielding throughtful reflections and calls for action. Together we wait expectantly in hope for a tomorrow in which love will truly prevail, in which, with <PERSON> Mary </PERSON>, we can confidently pray from our hearts: My soul proclaims the greatness of the Lord: My spirit rejoices in God my Savior For you, Lord, have looked with favor on your lowly servant From this day all generations will call me blessed: You, the Almighty, have done great things for me And holy is your name. You have mercy on those who fear you, From generation to generation. You have shown strength with your arm And scattered the proud in their conceit, Casting down the mighty from their thrones And lifting up the lowly. You have filled the hungry with good things And sent the rich away empty. You have come to the aid of your servant <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, To remember the promise of mercy, The promise made to our forebears, To <PERSON> Abraham </PERSON> and his children for ever.

<TEXT>
 `` <PERSON> Babette </PERSON>'s Feast,'' a Danish movie about two pious, unmarried sisters who take a political refugee into their home, won best foreign language film at the Academy Awards. `` It's the first time a Danish movie can take an Oscar home,'' director <PERSON> Gabriel </PERSON> <PERSON> Axel </PERSON>, who spent 14 years trying to get the movie made, said as he accepted the award Monday night. `` I am very grateful for this honor and I want to thank you Academy members from the bottom of my heart.'' Also nominated were `` Au <ORGANIZATION> Revoir </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Les </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enfants </ORGANIZATION>,'' <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>; `` Course Completed,'' <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>; `` The Family,'' <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, and `` Pathfinder,'' <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Axel </PERSON> has divided his career between his native <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>. `` <PERSON> Babette </PERSON>'s Feast'' portrayed the lives of the sisters who took in a political refugee named <PERSON> Babette </PERSON> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Stephane </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Audran </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- fleeing the French revolution. The refugee, a former world-class chef, later repays their kindness by devoting her winnings from a lottery to creation of a sumptuous feast. The film, titled `` Babettes Gaestebud'' in <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION>, was based on a short story by <PERSON> Isak </PERSON> <PERSON> Dinesen </PERSON>, whose book `` Out of <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'' was the basis for the 1986 best movie Oscar winner. Following his success with `` <PERSON> Babette </PERSON>'s Feast,'' <PERSON> Axel </PERSON> has said he hopes to film a project he has nurtured for 20 years _ a version of `` Hamlet'' based on the earliest histories of the saga from which <PERSON> Shakespeare </PERSON> borrowed his plot. Thirty countries submitted movies for consideration as best foreign film for this year's Academy Awards ceremony. The record for foreign submissions was 32 in 1984, according to <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Werden </PERSON>, an Academy spokesman.

 It's amazing that despite a writers' strike the Academy Awards could still be so gaseous and wordy. Everybody talked nonstop during Monday night's 60th annual Oscars ceremony on ABC: the host, the presenters, and especially the winners. There were frequent references to the strike by the <ORGANIZATION> Writers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guild </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>, and to the fact that some people had no scripts. It did n't slow anyone down, however. The winners seemed to have carte blanche to blab on until there was no one left to thank. Even master storyteller <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON>, in accepting the <PERSON> Irving </PERSON> <PERSON> Thalberg </PERSON> Award for lifetime achievement, rambled before making a poignant statement about his permanent entry into this country. It was an awards show that offered few surprises. Every front runner won as expected. The only suspense was whether `` The Last Emperor'' would win in all nine nominated categories. It did. The biggest thrill was seeing <PERSON> Cher </PERSON> win as best actress for `` Moonstruck.'' <PERSON> Cher </PERSON>, like <PERSON> Sally </PERSON> <PERSON> Field </PERSON> before her, has come a long way after a start in music and television that gave little hint of her talent. The awards show, as it has in recent years, got off to a fast, promising start. The opening number with the dancing gold Oscars was original and rousing. <ORGANIZATION> Host </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chevy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chase </ORGANIZATION> set an irreverent tone when he addressed the audience: `` Good evening, <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> phonies.'' The presentation of the animated shorts award by <PERSON> Mickey </PERSON> <PERSON> Mouse </PERSON>, with an assist from <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Selleck </PERSON>, was an inspired piece of casting. Last year's most eloquent winner, <PERSON> Marlee </PERSON> <PERSON> Matlin </PERSON> of `` Children of a Lesser God,'' stole the show again. The hearing-impaired actress spoke as she announced the nominees for best actor and named <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> as the winner. <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, a nominee for best actor and presenter of the Oscar for best director, also stole the show in his own inimitable way. He was very funny, and when he uttered a phrase that could have gotten on the air only on a live show he chortled at his own naughtiness. `` The phones are lighting up, folks,'' he said. `` The number is 1-800-Robin.'' <PERSON> Bernardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Bertolucci </PERSON> won as best director for `` The Last Emperor.'' When he returned later to accept another award as co-writer of the screenplay he explained that the guards would n't let him back into the auditorium until he displayed his Oscar The show, scheduled to run three hours, ran slightly more than 3 -LCB- hours. Not quite a record, but wearily close.

<HEAD>Merger Of Rivals Brings Virtual One-Party State To Zimbabwe</HEAD>
<BYLINE>AP News Analysis</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>By JERRY GRAY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The merger of two black political groups that led the war to end white-minority rule in <LOCATION> Zimbabwe </LOCATION>, then <LOCATION> Rhodesia </LOCATION>, virtually abolishes one of <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s few multiparty states. `` We have one <LOCATION> Zimbabwe </LOCATION>, one nation and one national army. We will be stronger if we have one party,'' President <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Mugabe </PERSON> said at a weekend rally. <PERSON> Mugabe </PERSON>, an avowed Marxist, led his party to victory in elections held after a British-sponsored peace conference ended years of guerrilla warfare and <LOCATION> Zimbabwe </LOCATION> became independent in April 1980. His chief rival in the balloting was <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Nkomo </PERSON>, one of the country's wealthiest men. They had organized guerrilla armies in the 1960s to gain black-majority rule and toward the end of the campaign joined forces. But the alliance collapsed in 1980, after <PERSON> Mugabe </PERSON>'s resounding victory and scattered clashes followed between the supporters of both sides. <PERSON> Mugabe </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Zimbabwe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, advocated one-party rule and was opposed by <PERSON> Nkomo </PERSON> and his <ORGANIZATION> Zimbabwe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peoples </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>. But last week, a Peoples Union convention endorsed a merger approved in December by <PERSON> Mugabe </PERSON> and <PERSON> Nkomo </PERSON>. On Saturday, <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> conference delegates approved the agreement. It is expected that by the end of the year, <PERSON> Mugabe </PERSON>'s party will be by law the sole political party in this southern African nation. Opponents say <PERSON> Mugabe </PERSON>'s party will turn capitalist <LOCATION> Zimbabwe </LOCATION> into a socialist state with <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> becoming a rubber-stamp legislature. Supporters claim the merger will bring unity to an area divided by tribal differences and with political structures too fragile to withstand the rigors of Western-style multiparty politics. The merger does not basically expand <PERSON> Mugabe </PERSON>'s solid power base. He has been in control since his party won 57 of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>'s 100 seats in pre-independence elections and has increased the number the number since then to 85. But the merger will give him the support to revise the British-drafted constitution that dictated a multiparty system for the first 10 years after independence. The constitution can be changed during that period only by a unanimous parliemtary vote. The new <ORGANIZATION> united </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> party </ORGANIZATION> will control all but one legislative seat. A businessman, <PERSON> Goodson </PERSON> <PERSON> Sithole </PERSON>, is the only representative of a small party that broke from the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>. He could block the one-party move with a negative vote, but is n't expected to stand up against the combined weight of the two main parties. For <PERSON> Mugabe </PERSON>, 64, his goal of creating a Marxist-Leninist state has involved more rhetoric then reality in his eight years in power. <LOCATION> Zimbabwe </LOCATION> remains one of <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s staunchest capitalist countries and whites, internally and externally, still control the economy. But <PERSON> Mugabe </PERSON> has made it clear he expects the country's leaders to be socialists. `` Surely, they -LRB- his opponents -RRB- can not be allowed to walk our public path of socialism with us, when at the same time they have charted for themselves their own private path of capitalism,'' he said at the convention on Saturday. For 70-year-old <PERSON> Nkomo </PERSON> the merger is a chance for the `` old lion,'' as his supporters call him, to leave the political scene with some of his former glory. <PERSON> Nkomo </PERSON> had been dumped from a coalition government shortly after the 1980 elections. But when the merger plans were announced in December after three years of negotiations, he became one of three senior ministers in the <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION>. In the new <ORGANIZATION> united </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> party </ORGANIZATION> he will be second vice-president _ the No. 3 slot.

 Omerta _ the <ORGANIZATION> Mafia </ORGANIZATION> code of silence _ is crumbling as authorities find it easier to turn mobsters into witnesses, according to top law enforcement officials and a former member of the Sicilian Mafia. `` When the going gets tough, the smart change sides,'' <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Keeney </PERSON>, acting chief of the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s Criminal Division, told a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee on Monday. `` The number and stature of convicted mobsters ` flipping' to the government's side in recent years is unprecedented.'' Before <PERSON> Keeney </PERSON> testified at the most extensive <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> organized crime hearings in a quarter-century, former Sicilian mobster <PERSON> Tommaso </PERSON> <PERSON> Buscetta </PERSON> helped prove <PERSON> Keeney </PERSON>'s point. Shielded by a screen to protect the public from seeing him, <PERSON> Buscetta </PERSON> said the Mafia in <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> has changed so drastically because of the drug trade that `` I no longer feel bound by the code of ` omerta.''' He testified before the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Permanent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Subcommittee </ORGANIZATION> on Investigations, which held dramatic hearings on organized crime a quarter-century ago. The chief witness then was <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Valachi </PERSON>, who told the panel the inner workings of La Cosa Nostra. Sen. <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON>, D-Ga., said he will hold three more hearings, so the panel can assess the state of organized crime 25 years after <PERSON> Valachi </PERSON>'s testimony Monday's most dramatic testimony came from <PERSON> Buscetta </PERSON>, who spoke in Italian and had his words translated for the committee. <PERSON> Buscetta </PERSON> has testified previously for the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Italian governments and helped convict nearly 500 mobsters, most in <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> Director <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sessions </PERSON>, two of his top aides, and <PERSON> Keeney </PERSON> all told the senators that law enforcement officials have severely damaged organized crime _ in part through new statutes and partly because the code of silence is now often broken. <PERSON> Buscetta </PERSON> gave some insight on why this has happened. `` Over the years, I have seen our organization change from within,'' <PERSON> Buscetta </PERSON> testified. `` I have seen money, drugs, and greed corrupt and destroy the Cosa Nostra code of honor and loyalty to the families. `` I began to realize that drugs had changed everything, the family loyalties and codes of respect that I had known as a Mafioso were quickly becoming things of the past.'' Sessions testified: `` Omerta ... has been broken in recent years. The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> has not only secured the cooperation and testimony of numerous individuals who have been utilized by the <ORGANIZATION> LCN </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cosa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nostra </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- to promote their criminal activities but has elicited the cooperation of four <ORGANIZATION> LCN </ORGANIZATION> members whose knowledge and testimony ... has enabled the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> to expand the attack on this national criminal enterprise.'' He identified the four as <PERSON> Aladena </PERSON> <PERSON> Frattiano </PERSON>, the former acting boss of the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> LCN family; <PERSON> Angelo </PERSON> <PERSON> Lonardo </PERSON>, the former underboss of the <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION> organized crime family; and <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Del </PERSON> <PERSON> Giorno </PERSON> and <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Caramandi </PERSON>, a capo -LRB- lieutenant -RRB- and soldier respectively in the <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> family. <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> executive assistant director <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Revell </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> said Mafia families in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> have not taken over the drug trade, although individual organized-crime members are involved with narcotics. `` There's a change in <ORGANIZATION> LCN </ORGANIZATION> membership,'' said <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Daniels </PERSON>, deputy assistant <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> director in the criminal investigative division. `` Where there is money to be made, members of <ORGANIZATION> LCN </ORGANIZATION> will become involved in anything.'' <PERSON> Revell </PERSON> also told the committee that the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> believes it knows who is responsible for the disappearance of former <ORGANIZATION> Teamsters </ORGANIZATION> union head <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoffa </PERSON> on July 30, 1975. <PERSON> Revell </PERSON> did not name them, but said they are in prison on other charges. <PERSON> Revell </PERSON> said he doubted there would be enough evidence to bring them to trial. The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> on earlier occasions has asserted that it believed it knew who killed <PERSON> Hoffa </PERSON>. An <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> memo suggested <PERSON> Hoffa </PERSON>'s disappearance was linked to <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> `` Tony Pro'' <PERSON> Provenzano </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jersey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Teamsters </ORGANIZATION> boss and reputed organized crime captain imprisoned on a racketeering conviction. <PERSON> Provenzano </PERSON> has denied he was involved.

 A hospital suspended its largely unsuccessful effort to harvest organs for transplants from infants born with most of their brains missing, as doctors took the sixth such baby off life support. Ten-day-old <PERSON> Hope </PERSON> <PERSON> Lovette </PERSON> <PERSON> Mount </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Knoxville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>, was removed from life support Monday and will be allowed to die, spokesman <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Schafer </PERSON> said by telephone from <ORGANIZATION> Loma </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Linda </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, 60 miles east of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Schaefer </PERSON> said that while <PERSON> Loma </PERSON> <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> plans to maintain five to seven more anencephalic babies on life support so they can be used as organ donors, the hospital wo n't do so until it modifies its existing guidelines for use of such infants, who are born with most of their brains missing. The review will be completed within two weeks, he said, refusing to elaborate on the planned changes. <PERSON> Loma </PERSON> <PERSON> Linda </PERSON>'s program was aimed at maintaining anencephalic babies on respirators for seven days or until they were declared brain-dead, whichever came first. Anencephalic babies inevitably die within days to weeks. The idea was to maintain them on life support so their organs would n't deteriorate as they died. The seven-day limit was established to counter criticism that the doomed babies were being kept alive _ and suffering _ indefinitely merely to save the lives of other babies needing donated organs. A <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> infant identified only as <PERSON> Baby </PERSON> <PERSON> John </PERSON> was the only one of the six anencephalic babies maintained on life support at <LOCATION> Loma </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Linda </LOCATION> to be declared brain-dead within the seven-day limit. But a suitable recipient for his heart and other organs could not be found. None of the five others were suitable for donations of major organs, although heart valves and corneas were transplanted from some of them. <PERSON> Loma </PERSON> <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> surgeons did transplant an anencephalic's heart into <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Holc </PERSON>, the son of a <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> couple, last Oct. 16. But that heart came from a baby girl who was maintained on life support in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ontario </LOCATION>, not at <LOCATION> Loma </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Linda </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON>, who received his new heart three hours after his birth by Caesarean section, was the world's youngest transplant recipient. He has been released from the hospital and physicians said recently he was doing well. <PERSON> Loma </PERSON> <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> triggered a major medical controversy in 1984 when Dr. <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON> implanted a baboon's heart in a girl known as <PERSON> Baby </PERSON> <PERSON> Fae </PERSON>, who was born with a fatally underdeveloped heart and died 20 -LCB- days after the transplant. Since then, the hospital turned toward anencephalic babies as possible organ donors for infants with fatal heart defects.

<HEAD>Study Finds Mixed U.S. Viewer Reax For High-Resolution TV</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 American television viewers welcome the improved picture quality of high-resolution television but are unwilling to pay a premium for it, according to initial audience testing studies. One study presented Monday at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasters </ORGANIZATION> convention here found that viewers usually preferred the clear and more brilliant picture produced by experimental high-definition TV -LRB- HDTV -RRB-, though the perceived improvement over conventional TV was subtle when watched on the size of sets found in most American homes. Screens would have to be two to three times larger to have a significant impact, it concluded. `` There will be HDTV. Most viewers most of the time prefer HDTV -LRB- to conventional TV -RRB-,'' said <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> <PERSON> Neuman </PERSON>, associate professor at the <ORGANIZATION> Media </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratory </ORGANIZATION> at the <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION>, who conducted the study. `` But with the wrong price and the wrong programming and at the wrong time, HDTV could fail.'' Audience research conducted by <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Box </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>, which provides programming to cable TV systems, shows that viewers, particularly young men, prefer the improved-quality picture of HDTV but were resistant to paying significantly more for it. `` Consumers are going to have to be aggressively marketed and the price will have to be close to the price for existing TVs,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Maxwell </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> HBO </ORGANIZATION> vice president for research. <PERSON> Maxwell </PERSON> said the company's testing found that viewers could recognize <ORGANIZATION> HDTV </ORGANIZATION>'s better quality picture when comparing it side-by-side to a conventional TV picture, but most could not tell the difference when alternately watching an HDTV picture separately from a conventional one. Two hundred sixty-eight viewers participated in <ORGANIZATION> HBO </ORGANIZATION>'s in side-by-side testing and 499 in an alternate viewing test. Both groups were watched 25-inch conventional sets and 28-inch HDTV sets. <PERSON> Maxwell </PERSON> said his results were preliminary and his research was not yet completed. But, he said, `` when we have better equipment and material and tests, I think the results will show consumers have high interest'' in HDTV, though `` they are n't going to pay a lot more for a TV set than they are now.'' The <ORGANIZATION> HBO </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Media </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lab </ORGANIZATION> research indicates that the introduction of HDTV to American consumers could be slow, especially considering that the first HDTV sets are estimated to cost more than $ 3,500. As with most new technology, prices would be expected to drop as sales increase. <PERSON> Neuman </PERSON> said his research contradicts the accepted wisdom of video professionals `` which posits that HDTV knocks the socks off everyone who sees it, represents an entirely new medium for storing, transmitting and displaying moving images, and will replace older media just as color TV replaced black and white.'' The Media Lab study, admittedly an early experiment, was conducted in a shopping mall in <LOCATION> Danvers </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, in early December. For 30 minutes, 613 randomly selected shoppers, in groups of five to 20, watched a variety of programs on conventional and <ORGANIZATION> HDTV </ORGANIZATION> sets. Sixty-two percent said they preferred the quality of HDTV overall, a figure <PERSON> Neuman </PERSON> said shows the new technology will not be a revolutionary development. He said he finds no basis for TV broadcasters' fears that their very survival could be threatened if the Japanese begin selling HDTV video cassette recorders and receivers in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> before broadcasters settle on an HDTV transmission system for their over-the-air signals. The Japanese plan to offer a satellite-based high definition TV system to homes in that country in 1990. The Europeans are expected to introduce their own system a couple of years later, but <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> research has lagged.

<HEAD>Contras Agree To Resume Technical Talks On Peace Pact</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Nicaraguan rebels agreed to a call from the leftist Sandinista government to resume technical talks on a cease-fire plan that had stalled over arms shipments to the U.S.-supported Contras. In another development, the opposition newspaper <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prensa </ORGANIZATION> received a fresh supply of newsprint from the government on Monday and said it would resume publication today for the first time since April 5. <PERSON> Cristiana </PERSON> <PERSON> Chamorro </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prensa </ORGANIZATION> assistant director, said the paper received 42 tons of newsprint from the government-owned monopoly at mid-day Monday, too late for <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prensa </ORGANIZATION> editors to put out an afternoon edition. <PERSON> La </PERSON> <PERSON> Prensa </PERSON> had attributed the cutoff of newsprint to `` discrimination of the government.'' It noted that Barricada, the Sandinista party mouthpiece, and the pro-government <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nuevo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Diario </ORGANIZATION> continued to publish without interruption. The Nicaraguan Resistance, the main Contra umbrella group, on Monday night said it will send a delegation to the southern town of <LOCATION> Sapoa </LOCATION> on Wednesday to resume the talks. There was no immediate reaction from the government. Earlier Monday, the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> proposed that the talks be held Wednesday or Thursday and suggested the Contras send an advance team to <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION> to prepare for high-ranking political discussions scheduled for Friday. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Contra </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Bosco </PERSON> <PERSON> Matamoros </PERSON> released a statement proposing the technical talks resume at noon Wednesday in <LOCATION> Sapoa </LOCATION>. Top-level Contra leaders will travel to <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION> on Friday to continue the peace negotiations with the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> based on progress at the <LOCATION> Sapoa </LOCATION> talks, the statement said. `` The high level commission composed of members of the directorate will arrive in <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION> April 15 subject to the work of the special commission,'' it said. The statement added that <PERSON> Roberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferrey </PERSON>, secretary of the resistance directorate, and <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Stadhagen </PERSON>, another Contra representative, will arrive in <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION> on Thursday to work out the agenda for the high-level meeting. Last Friday, military commanders of the two sides suspended negotiations on defining how the Contras are to gather in cease-fire zones in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. The meetings ended after the Contras asked for a recess of several days to discuss a 25-point government plan. The talks are called for in the March 23 cease-fire agreement reached by Sandinista and Contra leaders in <LOCATION> Sapoa </LOCATION>. Under terms of the plan, <ORGANIZATION> Contra </ORGANIZATION> guerrillas were to gather at the zones during the first 15 days of April. A provisional 60-day cease-fire went into effect April 1. In six days of discussions, both sides agreed on seven zones but failed to define the operating conditions and security measures. A 34-point <PERSON> Contra </PERSON> proposal would allow the rebels to maintain munitions in the zones. It also would prohibit the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> from receiving any military aid from the Soviet bloc. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Reichler </PERSON>, an American lawyer negotiating for the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION>, described those two points as `` absolutely unacceptable.'' The cease-fire plan would permit the Contras to receive only food and basic supplies channeled through a neutral organization. Political leaders of both sides had been scheduled to meet last Wednesday in <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION> but the rebels postponed the meeting, saying the technical talks in <LOCATION> Sapoa </LOCATION> had not advanced enough to move toward political issues. The rebels also have said they will not continue the high-level political talks unless they are free to meet with opposition leaders in <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION>. The government maintains that the peace agreement specifies Contra representation in politics begins only after the rebels move into the cease-fire zones.

<HEAD>U.S. Pleased With Revocation Of Amnesty In Slaying Of Americans</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> applauded a decision by President <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Napoleon </PERSON> <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON> that revoked an amnesty for three men charged in the 1985 slaying of six Americans. <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON> cited an international treaty as the legal basis for denying amnesty to the three suspects, said <PERSON> Rene </PERSON> <PERSON> Valdivieso </PERSON>, the secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> Martial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, who announced the decision Monday. `` On the issue of amnesty, it has been the position of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government that this attack on innocent unarmed persons should not go unpunished,'' said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> McManus </PERSON>. `` We welcome President <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON>'s decision to forward the case to the courts where evidence can be brought and a decision rendered.'' Thirteen people were killed on June 19, 1985, when assailants wearing Salvadoran ary uniforms opened fire with automatic weapons on patrons at two outdoor cafes in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>. Among the dead were four off-duty Marines and two <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> businessmen. The Marines, who were guards at the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION>, wore civilian clothes and sat at two tables with other young people when the attackers drove up. A little-known leftist group, the <ORGANIZATION> Mardoqueo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cruz </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guerrilla </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commandos </ORGANIZATION>, claimed responsibility for the killings. The group is an offshoot of one of the five guerrilla armies that form the <ORGANIZATION> Farabundo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marti </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, which has been fighting the U.S.-backed Salvadoran government for eight years. <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> <PERSON> Melendez </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Dimas </PERSON> <PERSON> Aguilar </PERSON> are charged with helping plan the `` Pink Zone massacre,'' named after the fashionable district of shops and restaurants where the killings occurred. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Rivas </PERSON> <PERSON> Bolanos </PERSON> is the only one of the three the government alleges was among the gunmen. None of the three has been tried. Eight other people, who are fugitives, allegedly took part in the crime. <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON>'s government decreed a broad amnesty in November 1987 as part of a regional peace accord. About 450 people were freed under the measure, which applied to those convicted or accused of politically motivated crimes. When the Martial Court, the country's highest military tribunal, ruled in January that the three men should receive amnesty, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government called the decision `` morally mistaken and politically damaging.'' The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> later approved a measure that calls for withholding 10 percent of appropriated economic aid to <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> if the suspects are freed. The three were kept in jail pending <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON>'s review of the case. A lower court military judge had ruled the three should be covered by the amnesty because their alleged crime was politically motivated. <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON>, as commander-in-chief of the armed forces, is empowered to review the Martial Court's decision. The treaty cited by <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON>, the Convention on the Prevention and <ORGANIZATION> Punishment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Crimes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Against </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Internationally </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protected </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Persons </ORGANIZATION>, was ratified by <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> in 1980. `` According to the president, the treaty takes precedence over the amnesty law,'' <PERSON> Valdivieso </PERSON> told reporters. Lawyer <PERSON> Armando </PERSON> <PERSON> Portillo </PERSON>, representing the suspects, said he has not decided whether to appeal the case to the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. He called <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON>'s reasoning `` arbitrary.'' The amnesty program was part of <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>'s compliance with a Central American peace plan signed in August 1987 by <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON> and the presidents of <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION>. About one-third of those freed under the program were leftist guerrillas. Another third were accused or convicted of crimes, including murder and torture, by rightist organizations. The political leanings of the other third was unclear. Two former national guardsmen convicted in the 1981 murders of two <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> land reform advisers were freed under the amnesty. Five national guardsmen convicted in the 1980 murders of four American churchwomen were not covered by the measure.

 The government says that it will immediately begin accepting applications for amnesty from illegal aliens who overstayed their student and tourist visas. Until further notice, the <ORGANIZATION> Immigration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Naturalization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> also announced Monday that it will defer the fee for such applications and issue a temporary work authorization card, in accordance with a court directive. INS regulations originally stipulated that non-immigrant aliens who overstayed their tourist or student visas must demonstrate that any violation of their immigration status had come to the attention of the <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> before Jan. 1, 1982, for them to qualify for the amnesty program. In a ruling on a class-action suit, U.S. District Judge <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> <PERSON> Sporkin </PERSON> said the regulation was too restrictive and declared that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> intended the law to mean that any government record, such as tax or Social Security documents, could be used to document that an illegal alien was known to federal authorities as of Jan. 1, 1982. Immigration experts say the clarifications affect at least 50,000 people. Under the 1986 immigration law, illegal aliens who have been in the country at least since Jan. 1, 1982, may qualify for legalized status. A 12-month application period for the amnesty program is due to expire May 4.

 <PERSON> Cher </PERSON> was as big a hit outside the Shrine Auditorium as inside, drawing gasps from more than a thousand fans packed into street grandstands when she stepped from her limousine in a stunning see-through gown. `` Go, go, go, go, go!'' chanted fans on each side of a red-carpeted walkway leading to the cavernous hall, as nominees arrived Monday amid a hullabaloo that has become an annual rite of the Academy Awards ceremony. <PERSON> Cher </PERSON>, who won best actress for `` Moonstruck,'' continued her tradition of outrageous outfits despite the seeming consensus among the stars this year for toned-down, mostly black fashions _ in variations of long, short, strapless, body-hugging and black-on-white or white-on-black. Arriving fashionably late in the 90-degree heat, <PERSON> Cher </PERSON> knocked the scream meter off the scale when she stepped from her limousine in a diaphanous outfit partly covered by a dark black cape and swept into the auditorium. However, for a time the Oscar ritual of hasty introductions, interviews and cheers for favorite stars gave way to a traffic jam, perhaps caused by the show's move from its longtime home at the <ORGANIZATION> Dorothy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chandler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pavilion </ORGANIZATION> in the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> Music Center. `` Please make room for the people outside to get in!'' Oscars greeter Army Archerd pleaded over a loudspeaker as arriving members of the <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pictures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION> and nominees backed up at the auditorium's doors as showtime neared. `` We are working in very tight quarters,'' said Archerd. `` The Academy has decided to be here for three years, so you better get used to it.'' `` Booooo,'' shouted the crowd packed into bleachers alongside the walkway. The 60th annual Oscars marked the award show's first return to the Shrine, on the edge of an old neighborhood next to the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION>, since 1947. `` The traffic was so bad I was being asphyxiated in the limo,'' said character actor <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Richman </PERSON>, who appears in TV's `` Bonanza: The Next Generation. Fans dressed in shorts, sandals and T-shirts watched a 10-block procession of limousines and frequented a garden hose that was set up by the Academy for curbside refreshment in the heat. Fifteen minutes before showtime, actresses Meryl Streep and <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> <PERSON> Close </PERSON>, who is nine months pregnant, were seen walking quickly up <LOCATION> Jefferson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Boulevard </LOCATION> to the theater to make it on time. `` Fatal Attraction'' co-star <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> <PERSON> Archer </PERSON> wore a wide-shouldered, sleeveless black dress with a V-cut back and a silvered midriff along with black gloves. <PERSON> Sally </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirkland </PERSON>, star of `` <PERSON> Anna </PERSON>,'' was elegant in a strapless black gown with a velvet bodice. <PERSON> Faye </PERSON> <PERSON> Dunaway </PERSON> was sharp in a black skirt and a white jacket with a black-stripe design. `` Dirty Dancing'' star <PERSON> Jennifer </PERSON> <PERSON> Grey </PERSON> came in a tight, shoulderless, long-sleeve mini. <PERSON> Liza </PERSON> <PERSON> Minnelli </PERSON> topped a long black dress with a red cape. There were daring exceptions. <PERSON> Candice </PERSON> <PERSON> Bergen </PERSON> arrived bare-shouldered in a form-fitting red dress. <PERSON> Marlee </PERSON> <PERSON> Matlin </PERSON> stepped out in strapless, knee-length purple dress with a large bow at her waist. <PERSON> Daryl </PERSON> <PERSON> Hannah </PERSON> glittered in a white-gold, knee-length dress and gold high heels. And, of course, the perennial <PERSON> Edie </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> strutted back and forth in front of the cameras in a pale blue bikini top and mini skirt, sporting a puppy on one shoulder. Archerd later whipped up the fans with an impromptu fan poll. The best picture winner on the applause meter was `` Moonstruck.'' The movie, however, lost out in the Academy voting to `` The Last Emperor,'' which garnered that <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> and eight others.

<HEAD>Jackson Moves Further From Arafat</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> continued to reach out to Jewish voters by further distancing himself from <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> as the candidates enter the final week of campaigning before the delegate-rich <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> primary. When asked Monday about meeting with <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said: `` It would not be a good approach to start at the table with the most extreme elements _ that's a formula for catastrophe.'' Rather, the Democratic presidential contender said, `` In this city some of your top Palestinian leaders in the world live. Some of your top <PERSON> Jewish-American </PERSON> and pro-Israeli leaders live. We should begin to talk here, to implore both sides to a higher level of security.'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s remarks caused some Arab-American supporters to chastise him Monday, while others rallied to his defense. On Sunday, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said that, if elected president, he would not meet again with <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> has been widely criticized for meeting with <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> in 1979. <PERSON> Abdeen </PERSON> <PERSON> Jabara </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> American-Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Anti-Discrimination </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, accused <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> of abandoning his principles in his quest for the presidency. But <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Zogby </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> Arab-American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> has a nine-year record of commitment to Palestinian rights and to justice for both Israelis and Palestinians. Nearly one quarter of the Democrats expected to vote in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s April 19 primary are Jewish, and for many of them, the future of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> is a critical issue. While in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> also continued his appeal to blue-collar voters. Some union leaders called <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> `` one of us'' at a labor rally on his behalf. `` He's the only candidate who will get on the picket line and walk with the workers,'' said <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> Lantz </PERSON>, vice president of the <ORGANIZATION> Independent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Flight </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Attendants </ORGANIZATION>, after <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> addressed a crowd of 5,000 labor leaders and union members Monday night. <PERSON> Lantz </PERSON>, who characterized <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> as `` one of us,'' said the other candidates may support labor, but `` you never see them.'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> told the overflow crowd at the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center that blue-collar workers `` will have a friend in the White House'' if he becomes president. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> reminded the crowd that he has stood with them numerous times on picket lines, and asked them to stand with him now by supporting his candidacy. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> also campaigned north of the city Monday, addressing a rally at <ORGANIZATION> Rockland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> and greeting workers at a General Motors plant in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Tarrytown </LOCATION>. At the <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> plant and the labor rally, he sounded his familiar theme of battling economic violence and told the workers: `` We built our campaign at the plant gate.'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> is only a handful of delegates behind Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> in the Democratic race. <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> is running third.

 Following is a list of 1987's top 10 moneymakers and how they performed at the 60th-annual Academy Awards.

 <PERSON> Sonny </PERSON> <PERSON> Bono </PERSON>, whose ex-wife <PERSON> Cher </PERSON> won best actress at the Oscars, vied for best candidate in a mayoral race with six opponents today in <LOCATION> Palm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, one of several elections in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, Rep. <PERSON> Beau </PERSON> <PERSON> Boulter </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Amarillo </LOCATION> opposed <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> businessman <PERSON> Wes </PERSON> <PERSON> Gilbreath </PERSON> in a primary runoff for the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> nomination to challenge Democratic Sen. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>. In <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, eight candidates were running in a special election to fill the state Assembly seat vacated by Mayor <PERSON> Art </PERSON> <PERSON> Agnos </PERSON>. The top contenders were former <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Burton </PERSON>, 55, and fellow liberal Democrat <PERSON> Roberta </PERSON> <PERSON> Achtenberg </PERSON>, 37, a lesbian rights lawyer whose election would make her the legislature's first openly gay member. <PERSON> Bono </PERSON>, a 53-year-old entertainer and restaurateur, built a recording career with <PERSON> Cher </PERSON> during more than the two decades, and was the butt of her jokes during their TV variety show. <PERSON> Cher </PERSON> won the best actress at Monday night's Oscar ceremonies for her performance in the movie `` Moonstruck.'' <PERSON> Bono </PERSON> said he has campaigned hard to convince voters his candidacy for the part-time, $ 15,000-a-year mayor's job was no publicity stunt. `` They thought it was a joke,'' he said recently. `` Now they take me seriously.'' Also running were Vice Mayor <PERSON> Eli </PERSON> <PERSON> Birer </PERSON>, businesswoman <PERSON> Deyna </PERSON> <PERSON> Hodges </PERSON>, accountant <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Maryanov </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Agua </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Caliente </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Indian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tribe </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Patencio </PERSON>, real estate agent <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> Beatty </PERSON> and retired dentist <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> <PERSON> Friedman </PERSON>. The <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> runoff was required because no candidate received a majority in the March 8, four-way <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> primary. <PERSON> Gilbreath </PERSON>, who has spent about $ 1 million of his own money in the race, was the top candidate with 37 percent of the vote. <PERSON> Boulter </PERSON>, who received 30 percent, later picked up endorsements from the third - and fourth-place finishers as well as the majority of <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> leaders Rep. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.Y. </LOCATION>, campaigned Monday for <PERSON> Boulter </PERSON> in several <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> cities. <PERSON> Boulter </PERSON>, a 46-year-old two-term congressman, backed <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>'s failed bid for the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> presidential nomination. The presidential race and <PERSON> Gilbreath </PERSON>'s money were the campaign's main issues <PERSON> Gilbreath </PERSON>, a 59-year-old first-time office seeker, said <PERSON> Boulter </PERSON>'s support of <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> would hurt <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> if Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> becomes president. <PERSON> Boulter </PERSON> said <PERSON> Gilbreath </PERSON> supported former television evangelist <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>'s unsuccessful bid for the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> presidential nomination. <PERSON> Gilbreath </PERSON> has declined to say he voted for in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>' Republican presidential primary The <PERSON> Boulter </PERSON> campaign, which spent about $ 250,000, complained about <PERSON> Gilbreath </PERSON>'s deep pockets. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, breezed to renomination in March over a little-known <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION> professor. The incumbent has said he does not care which Republican he faces in his November bid for a fourth term. In <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Achtenberg </PERSON>, 37, campaigned Monday at transit stations and a senior citizens' home. `` We are extremely optimistic,'' she said. `` It all depends on the voter turnout. Our polls indicate it's a dead heat.'' <PERSON> Burton </PERSON> visited churches in the district on Sunday, reminding parishioners of his civil rights voting record and that of his late brother, <PERSON> Phillip </PERSON>, and late sister-in-law, <PERSON> Sala </PERSON>, who also represented the city in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Burton </PERSON>, who held the Assembly seat between 1965 and 1975, was sidelined from politics in 1983 by a cocaine addiction. The other candidates were Republicans <PERSON> Max </PERSON> <PERSON> Woods </PERSON> and <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Mavrogeorge </PERSON>, Libertarian <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Meyer </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Peace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Freedom </ORGANIZATION> candidate <PERSON> Melissa </PERSON> <PERSON> Ehman </PERSON>, and independents <PERSON> Hope </PERSON> <PERSON> Joles </PERSON> and <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Schmitt </PERSON>. The district is overwhelmingly Democratic, and candidates from other parties were given little chance of mounting serious opposition. If no candidate wins a majority, the top two vote-getters will face each other in a runoff June 7. <PERSON> Agnos </PERSON>' two-year term ends this year, and the Democratic primary for the seat also will be held June 7.

<DATELINE>LARNACA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The hijackers of a Kuwaiti jumbo jet today said they have named their aircraft `` the plane of martyrdom and death'' and claimed they have put on their `` death shrouds.'' One of the hijackers made the declaration in a statement radioed to <LOCATION> Larnaca </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> control tower. He cited Koranic verses usually read at funerals that said `` those killed in the name of God are always alive.'' Earlier today, the hijackers of the <ORGANIZATION> Kuwait </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> 747, who shot and killed a second passenger on Monday, threatened the lives of the nearly 50 remaining hostages and again demanded fuel for the plane so they could leave <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION> for an unspecified `` neutral country.'' The hijackers, who are armed with grenades and handguns, did not explain whether their statement today meant they planned to carry out their oft-repeated threat to blow up the plane. However, their statement revealed, as had been suspected, that the hijackers are fanatical Shiite Moslems. The statement said `` hail the glory of Imam <PERSON> Mahdi </PERSON>,'' the messiah-like holy person Shiites believe will one day appear on earth. Only Shiite Moslems revere the imams, or saints, among the Islamic sects. Before the statement, it only was known for certain that the hijackers were Arab-speaking. The hijackers have demanded <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> free 17 pro-Iranian terrorists, all but one of them Shiites, who were convicted in 1984 for bombing the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and French embassies in <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>. The emirate has repeatedly refused to free them. <PERSON> Akis </PERSON> <PERSON> Fantis </PERSON>, <PERSON> Cypriot </PERSON> government spokesman, earlier today said no negotiations were under way as the hijacking entered its eighth day. <PERSON> Fantis </PERSON> added that the chances of storming the plane at <LOCATION> Larnaca </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> were `` zero.'' Fifty-two people _ including at least five or six hijackers _ were believed to be aboard the <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 747 after the bloodstained body of a man was thrown through the jet's door on Monday, his hands tied behind his back. The hostages include three members of <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>'s extensive royal family _ a man and two women. On Monday, <LOCATION> Kuwaiti </LOCATION> Foreign Minister <PERSON> Sheik </PERSON> <PERSON> Sabah </PERSON> <PERSON> Al-Ahmed </PERSON> <PERSON> Al-Sabah </PERSON> said his country is prepared to lose more hostages rather than give in to the hijackers. `` We will try our utmost to protect our dear ones aboard the plane, but we will not surrender to any blackmail, even if we lose more of them,'' he told reporters in <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>. `` This is not the decision of <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>'s government. It is a decision of the people.'' He added that the presence of three members of the ruling <PERSON> Al-Sabah </PERSON> family aboard the jet `` will not influence our decision.'' To complicate matters, terrorist groups in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> have threatened to kill foreign hostages they are holding, including three Americans, if security forces storm the plane in a bid to free the passengers. In their statement today, the hijackers declared in classical, Koranic Arabic: `` We have decided to call our plane the plane of martyrdom and death. Death with glory is better than life under humiliation ... We call on the <LOCATION> Kuwaiti </LOCATION> people to revolt against the <LOCATION> Kuwaiti </LOCATION> dictatorship. We'd like to point out we're not against the people of <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>, but against the regime.'' It continued: `` We have decided to wear the death shrouds under our clothes and that either all our 17 brothers come back to us or else we shall meet, in our shrouds, in the heaven of eternal happiness.'' The reference to wearing death shrouds `` under our clothes'' may have indicated the hijackers are not yet prepared to become martyrs. But the tone of the statement, and its repeated references to death, appeared designed to put pressure on Cypriot authorities to refuel the plane. After the passenger was killed Monday, an unidentified hijacker told the tower: `` We have executed a <LOCATION> Kuwaiti </LOCATION> officer. We also reconfirm the craft must be refueled immediately, immediately, before we take more dangerous steps.'' <PERSON> Fantis </PERSON> said the slain passenger had been shot twice in the head and that fingerprints were being sent to <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> for identification. Doctors at the <LOCATION> Larnaca </LOCATION> morgue said the side of his face was badly injured, possibly because he had been beaten before he was killed when officials refused repeated demands by the hijackers to refuel the plane. The hostage slain on Monday was the second of three <LOCATION> Kuwaiti </LOCATION> military men reported aboard the jet. Doctors said another military man, a 24-year-old border guard, also was beaten 18 to 24 hours before he was shot three times in the head on Saturday and dropped on the tarmac. The reference to flying to a `` neutral country'' was the first time since landing at <LOCATION> Larnaca </LOCATION> that the hijackers have given any inkling of where they want to go. They did not name any country. But <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>'s Al-Qabas daily on Monday reported that Algerian officials have become involved in the negotiations. The plane was hijacked on Tuesday with 112 people aboard on a flight from <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> and forced down in <LOCATION> Mashhad </LOCATION>, northeast <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, where 57 people were freed. The plane left <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> on Friday after refueling. After <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> refused to let it touch down at their airports, the plane landed at <LOCATION> Larnaca </LOCATION> after the pilot radioed he was running out of fuel. Another captive, an ailing 32-year-old Kuwaiti, was freed in <LOCATION> Larnaca </LOCATION> on Saturday, apparently after <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> intervention.

These were some of the highlights of chit-chat backstage Monday night, as <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> winners and presenters shuttled into a huge white tent erected behind the Shrine Auditorium where the 60th-annual Academy Awards presentations were made. With an estimated billion people watching the show on television, the parking lot big top was teeming with hundreds of reporters brimming with questions at an ongoing news conference during the ceremony. How does it feel? What does it mean? What are you going to do with the statuette? <PERSON> Gabriella </PERSON> <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON>, winner of the editing Oscar for `` The Last Emperor,'' was most succinct: `` I'm just happy. I do n't know what it means.'' But most winners of behind-the-scenes Oscars _ those for editing, costumes and the like _ were ignored by reporters. One of the co-winners of the visual effects award stood at a microphone and, questionless, began singing `` <LOCATION> Moon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>.'' An ambulance took an unconscious actress to a hospital after she collapsed near the lobby in 90-degree heat before the show began, touching off whirlwind of backstage rumor and questioning. It was finally determined <PERSON> Anita </PERSON> <PERSON> Page </PERSON>, the 77-year-old star of `` Broadway Melody,'' fainted and was all right. Reporters from the <ORGANIZATION> Village </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Voice </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Variety </ORGANIZATION>, the Hollywood Reporter, <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Today </ORGANIZATION> and columnists <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Ebert </PERSON> and <PERSON> Marilyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Beck </PERSON> blurted out questions then scribbled answers on note pads and punched quotes into portable computers. At the same time, they listened to acceptance speeches on earphones feeding them audio from the inside the Shrine. Two giant television screens were the reporters' link to the show. The media is not allowed inside the auditorium. <PERSON> Cher </PERSON>, who won as best actress for `` Moonstruck,'' and <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, the best supporting actress for the same movie, both revealed they were rooting for political candidates. Miss <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> boosted the presidential aspirations of her cousin, <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Cher </PERSON> put in a good word for ex-husband <PERSON> Sonny </PERSON> <PERSON> Bono </PERSON>'s bid today as <LOCATION> Palm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION> mayor. `` OK <PERSON> Michael </PERSON>, let's go!'' said Miss <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> during the ceremony; <PERSON> Cher </PERSON> said she was n't sure if <PERSON> Bono </PERSON> would win, but said: `` I hope so.'' Miss <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> excused herself, saying her cousin was waiting for her call in an <LOCATION> Italian </LOCATION> restaurant in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, where he is campaigning in the state's Democratic primary. `` It's the year of the Dukaki,'' she said. Sipping on a glass of wine, <PERSON> Sean </PERSON> <PERSON> Connery </PERSON> stepped before the backstage microphone and declared his award for best supporting actor was `` an accumulation of the body of his work.'' `` I'm going to have a few drinks,'' he said when asked how he would celebrate. A footsore <PERSON> Cher </PERSON> carried her black high heels in one hand and her Oscar in the other, apologizing to reporters for her aching feet. But the topic of conversation focused on her see-through <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Mackie </PERSON> gown. `` I do n't think it's too far,'' <PERSON> Cher </PERSON> said, looking down at the sparse coverage that left little to the imagination. `` Everything's covered I do n't think you can see anything. There's not much to see anyway.'' Her son <PERSON> Elijah </PERSON> <PERSON> Blue </PERSON> <PERSON> Allman </PERSON> was promised the Oscar statuette for the night and from there it will spend an extended period on her bedroom fireplace. `` If I can win this statue, I think anybody can do anything,'' <PERSON> Cher </PERSON> said. The 5-week-old <ORGANIZATION> Writers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guild </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> strike was an occasional topic of backstage conversation. Best-actor winner <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> said he was taking the summer off because his next project could n't proceed without the writers, but presenter <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> <PERSON> Crystal </PERSON>, a union writer and performer, was unfazed. `` It did n't really affect me. We were doing old material, that's why there's nothing topical,'' said Crystal `` My entire monologue was generously donated by five Teamsters,'' quipped show host Chevy Chase. `` There may be a writer's strike, but there is n't a readers strike.''

<TEXT>
 A type of blood test barred as evidence in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> criminal trials is on trial itself this week, as supporters seek to overturn the state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>'s 1986 ruling declaring it inadmissible. Prosecutors from <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kent </PERSON> counties claim electrophoresis has been refined since the high court's decision. Attorneys representing two defendants against whom test results could be applied deny the prosecutors' claims. The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>'s 1986 ruling came on a 3-2 decision with two justices not taking part. Since then, one of the justices in the majority _ former Chief Justice <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mennen </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> _ has died and has been replaced by <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON>. In an unusual arrangement, Circuit Judges <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Benson </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Kent </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Maureen </PERSON> <PERSON> Reilly </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Wayne </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> began taking testimony Monday in a joint evidentiary hearing. Assistant prosecutors <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Vander </PERSON> <PERSON> Molen </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Kent </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Bruno </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Wayne </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> are seeking decisions from the judges allowing use of electrophoresis tests as evidence in stabbing cases they are handling. <PERSON> Vander </PERSON> <PERSON> Molen </PERSON> is prosecuting a case against <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Tanner </PERSON>, 26, charged with two counts of assault with intent to murder. <PERSON> Bruno </PERSON> is prosecuting <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Stoughton </PERSON>, 21, charged with two counts of first-degree murder in the deaths of two people in <LOCATION> Taylor </LOCATION>. `` We think the -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- decision was a mistake and we hope to correct it,'' <PERSON> Vander </PERSON> <PERSON> Molen </PERSON> said before Monday's hearing began. But <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Schaefer </PERSON>, <PERSON> Tanner </PERSON>'s attorney, said he does n't think the test has been accepted generally by scientists for use in criminal trials. `` I think the prosecution and the prosecution community want to change the ruling,'' he said. `` There's been a change in the -LRB- Supreme -RRB- court. ... It's not that there has been a scientific advancement.'' Electrophoresis is a process to separate molecules of a substance by their electrical charge. It has been used in genetic testing, identification of certain enzymes in a variety of organs and in analysis of DNA, which carries genetic characteristics. The hearing is expected to last a week and should involve detailed scientific testimony about proteins, enzymes and `` markers'' they leave in dried blood. <PERSON> Vander </PERSON> <PERSON> Molen </PERSON> said use of the test in his case against <PERSON> Tanner </PERSON> is not critical. But, he said: `` We've got nearly 10 cases in which we need this test. This kind of evidence is important in the most serious of cases.''

<HEAD>Researchers Gather for Pain Conference</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Describing an ache may be easy to the sufferer, but to pain researchers the feeling of hurt is complex almost beyond description. Researchers at a four-day international `` Pain Measurement'' conference that began Monday are trying to develop a unified theory for the study of pain. The conference is sponsored by the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> and funded by a grant from the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institutes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION>. One in three people in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> suffers from chronic pain and millions are routinely incapacitated by it, but medical science often can do little to to prevent or effectively treat recurrent pain, because patients are suffering from something that ca n't be seen, felt or observed by someone else. The subjective and intangible nature of pain frustrates many people involved in its research. `` The problem with the meaning of the word pain has been around since <PERSON> Aristotle </PERSON>,'' said Dr. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Loeser </PERSON>, a neurosurgeon and director of the university's Multidisciplinary Pain Center. `` How do you go about measuring pain?'' <PERSON> Loeser </PERSON> asks. `` We're not very far along in the clinical setting. It's too complex a phenomenon.'' Only within about the last two decades has the problem of pain gained serious attention in medical research, in large part because of the pioneering efforts of Dr. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Bonica </PERSON>, chairman emeritus of the school's department of anesthesiology. <PERSON> Bonica </PERSON>'s work on the management of pain, which emphasizes a comprehensive approach rather than hit-and-miss drug therapies, paved the way for the serious study of pain. `` Everybody measures pain in a different way,'' said <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Chapman </PERSON>, a psychopharmacologist in pain research at the university and the independent <ORGANIZATION> Fred </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutchinson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cancer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>. `` We do n't at present have a theory, a single theory, that everyone agrees upon,'' said <PERSON> Chapman </PERSON>. Pain measurement research generally relies on laboratory tests of animals, lab tests on humans or studies of patient care, each with its own accepted methods for measuring and defining pain. None completely translates into an acceptable method for the other. <PERSON> Chapman </PERSON> said pain often is taken seriously by medical professionals only when tissue damage can be identified, although a lot of chronic pain apparently exists without any identifiable tissue damage. Some researchers try to measure this kind of pain by analyzing behavior or looking at brain waves and other electrical signals. Those dealing with humans ask the sufferer to describe the hurt, `` but how can you tell if an infant, who ca n't yet speak, is experiencing pain?'' asked <PERSON> Loeser </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> researchers expect a good deal of argument and contention at the conference. In fact, they deliberately scheduled scientists with opposing views to speak in succession. About 60 researchers are expected to attend. `` It's my belief that we can bring this all together if we can find a uniform theory for pain,'' said <PERSON> Chapman </PERSON>. `` When we have reached it, our power to solve the perplexities of pain scientifically and to control the human and animal suffering that it causes will be greatly increased.''

<HEAD>Tokyo Market Hits Record High Closing; Dollar Edges Upward</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>'s key stock market indicator closed today at an all-time high and the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar climbed in trading against the Japanese yen. The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, which gained 175.98 points Monday, added another 5.97 points, or 0.02 percent, to close at 26,930.84. On Monday, the stock market's key barometer briefly touched a new high of 26,998.36 points during the morning trading, but then fell back. Boosted by the steady dollar and a strong Monday showing on Wall Street, the Nikkei index soared again today to 26,976.21 points minutes after the start of trading. Then profit-taking set in, indicating `` the market was rising too high -LRB- and -RRB- eased share prices a little in the afternoon,'' said <PERSON> Tadaaki </PERSON> <PERSON> Uehara </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Wako </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION>. However, the index rose again in the market's last hour, led by blue chip electricals, <PERSON> Uehara </PERSON> said. Many investors were encouraged by the dollar's stability and felt the electricals would continue to benefit from the stable dollar, traders said. Other popular issues included precision machineries, drugs and constructions. Losers included chemicals, securities and real estates. Volume on the first section trade was estimated at a moderate 750 million shares, down from 900 million shares Monday. On the <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> foreign exchange market, meanwhile, the dollar closed at 126.50 yen, up 0.79 yen from its close Monday of 125.71 yen and up also from its opening today of 126.40 yen. `` It appears the dollar has stabilized at what it should be,'' said a foreign exchange dealer at a major commercial bank, speaking on condition of anonymity. Trading was mixed in dollar-buying and selling, with a strong wait-and-see attitude among participants regarding this week's meeting in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> of monetary authorities from seven major economic nations, he said The bank dealer said <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s shrinking trade deficit contributed to the dollar-buying. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s trade surplus in fiscal 1987 declined 15.3 percent from the previous year, the first such drop in six years, shrinking from $ 89.736 billion in 1986 to $ 76.015 billion last year, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>.

<TEXT>
 A convicted murderer has flown to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> after renouncing his citizenship under a special clemency agreement that allowed him to finish his prison term working on a kibbutz. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Shapiro </PERSON>, 62, had served 13 years of a life term that carried a minimum 25-year sentence when he boarded an <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Al </ORGANIZATION> jet Monday night. A notary public witnessed his renunciation after a federal judge said it did not fall under his authority. `` I have researched the law thoroughly, but I have found nothing in any federal law which gives me jurisdiction to accept such renunciation,'' Judge <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Spellman </PERSON> told <PERSON> Shapiro </PERSON> and defense attorney <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Jacobowitz </PERSON> before calling a notary public to the courtroom. <PERSON> Shapiro </PERSON> was granted clemency under an agreement between the state <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Executive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Clemency </ORGANIZATION>, made up of Gov. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> and his Cabinet, and the Israeli government because of <PERSON> Shapiro </PERSON>'s past ties to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s old <ORGANIZATION> Haganah </ORGANIZATION>, a secret military force that helped win <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> independence in 1948. <PERSON> Shapiro </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> businessman born in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, was accused of hiring two men to kill a business partner. A <LOCATION> Dade </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> circuit jury convicted him in February 1976 of first-degree murder and conspiracy to commit murder for the pipe-beating death of <PERSON> Burt </PERSON> <PERSON> deWitt </PERSON>. But <PERSON> Shapiro </PERSON>'s supporters have long pointed to his Haganah background, his World War II and Korean War service as a Marine combat officer and his 12 years with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s police to support their claim that he could n't have been been guilty. Elements of the <ORGANIZATION> Haganah </ORGANIZATION>, with about 10,000 members by the mid-1930s, served with the British in defense of the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> during World War II. After <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> gained independence in 1948, the <ORGANIZATION> Haganah </ORGANIZATION> became the core of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s army. <PERSON> Shapiro </PERSON>'s legal file shows he did n't participate directly in the pipe-beating. `` The evidence just was n't very strong against <PERSON> Shapiro </PERSON>,'' said attorney <PERSON> Alvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Lodish </PERSON>, who was asked to handle the case by <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s consul general in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Rahamin </PERSON> <PERSON> Timor </PERSON> `` It is highly unusual to have someone convicted of first-degree murder on evidence like that.'' Clemency was granted last month. Under the deal, <PERSON> Shapiro </PERSON> had to renounce his <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizenship and relocate at <LOCATION> Kibbutz </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ayelet-Hashar </LOCATION>, where he will work at least eight hours a day, six days a week. <PERSON> Herut </PERSON> <PERSON> Lapid </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kibbutz </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION> of which the collective farm is a member, assured <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> officials in a letter that a rehabilitation plan has been worked out for <PERSON> Shapiro </PERSON>.

 Despite <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> criticism, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> today threatened to deport more Palestinians from the occupied territories to break a 4-month-old uprising. On Monday, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> expelled eight Arabs to neighboring <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. In another development, <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers killed two Palestinians on Monday during clashes in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>. Eight Arabs were wounded. The deaths brought to 143 the number of Arabs killed since rioting began Dec. 8. Two Israelis have been killed _ a teen-age settler and a soldier. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> on Monday issued deportation orders for 12 other Palestinians. Among them were six Arabs from the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> village of <LOCATION> Beita </LOCATION>, where an Israeli settler girl and two Palestinians were killed in a clash last week. `` There are a list of others slated for deportation. We will not hesitate to deport them if we find it necessary,'' <PERSON> Shmuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Goren </PERSON>, a defense official who administers the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, told <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION> today. <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said they drew up a list of 200 Palestinians who were slated for expulsion in January but sharply reduced the number at the time, following an appeal from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>, interviewed today by <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> radio, said he hoped the expulsions would crush the wave of <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> rioting in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, which were captured in the 1967 <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> war. `` We know other countries and people in other countries are not happy with this, but we have to take care of our security and not them,'' <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> said. Critics on Monday claimed the expulsions were aimed at appeasing Jewish settlers, who were angered by an army report saying the girl, 15-year-old <PERSON> Tirza </PERSON> <PERSON> Porat </PERSON>, was accidentally killed by a bullet from a gun a settler used while guarding a group of Jewish hikers. Settlers say the girl was killed by <PERSON> Arabs </PERSON>. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> on Monday said the expulsions `` only further inflame passions'' and violate international human rights agreements. Israeli troops killed two Palestinians on Monday after a patrol was attacked by dozens of protesters who threw stones and bottles in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> village of Rai near <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION>, the army said. Arab doctors and hospital officials said <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers on Monday wounded eight Palestinians: three in <LOCATION> Rai </LOCATION>, including an 11-year-old girl and a 14-year-old boy; four Arabs in <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION>; and another in <LOCATION> Jenin </LOCATION>. Also Monday, the army said 4,800 Arabs have been arrested since Dec. 8. Of those, 500 were convicted, 3,400 await trial and 900 are held in administrative detention, which allows imprisonment without trial for six months. The eight deportees, five from the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> and three from the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, arrived in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Bekaa </LOCATION> valley on Monday night and asked to be handed over to the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION>. An army helicopter flew the men to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s self-proclaimed security zone in southern <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. They were handed $ 50 each and led to two waiting taxis. <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> showed some of the men carrying belongings in plastic bags. As the taxis drove off, one of the deportees made the V for victory sign with his fingers. The army described the deportees as senior members of terror groups and said some were `` organizers and instigators'' of anti-Israeli protests. The most prominent is <PERSON> Abed </PERSON> <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Aziz </PERSON> <PERSON> Uda </PERSON> <PERSON> Rafia </PERSON>, 33, of <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, described by the army as spiritual leader of <LOCATION> Islamic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jihad </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. Islamic Jihad, or Islamic Holy War, is a Moslem fundamentalist group pledged to destroying <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. Critics say such measures violate the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> Convention, which bars deportation of civilians in times of war. Israeli officials maintain the convention only applies to mass expulsions. Palestinian leaders on Monday denounced the expulsions as collective punishment and said they would fuel more unrest. The army said the six <PERSON> Beita </PERSON> residents ordered deported took part in a stoning attack on 16 Israeli teen-age hikers and two armed guards from the Jewish <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> settlement of <LOCATION> Elon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Moreh </LOCATION>. A preliminary army report concluded that <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Porat </PERSON> was struck by a bullet from the gun of <PERSON> Romem </PERSON> <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Dubi </PERSON>, one of two guards accompanying the hikers. The report set off a sharp political debate along party lines, with settlers and right-wing politicians denouncing it as one-sided and hasty, and demanding the resignation of the army chief of staff. Some hikers insist Miss <PERSON> Porat </PERSON> was shot by an Arab that some saw pointing a Soviet-made rifle from a rooftop.

 <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s legislature approved a new Cabinet today that includes younger members more closely tied to economic reforms of senior leader <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaoping </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> General Secretary <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> <PERSON> Ziyang </PERSON>. The 2,859 delegates of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> also passed constitutional amendments sanctioning private businesses and the right to transfer use of land. Delegates confirmed 41 ministerial posts, named three vice premiers and appointed nine as state councilors to the State Council, or Cabinet. They also trimmed the council as part of government efforts to become more efficient, eliminating posts for two vice premiers, two state councilors and four ministers. <PERSON> Qian </PERSON> <PERSON> Qichen </PERSON>, 60, who has been vice foreign minister in charge of relations with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, succeeded <PERSON> Wu </PERSON> <PERSON> Xueqian </PERSON> as foreign minister, while Gen. <PERSON> Qin </PERSON> <PERSON> Jiwei </PERSON>, 74, a member of the Politburo and head of the <ORGANIZATION> Beijing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Military </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Region </ORGANIZATION>, took over the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> from ailing <PERSON> Zhang </PERSON> <PERSON> Aiping </PERSON>, 78. The three vice premiers who will serve under Premier <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Peng </PERSON> are outgoing Foreign Minister <PERSON> Wu </PERSON>, 67, <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Planning </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> Minister <PERSON> Yao </PERSON> <PERSON> Yilin </PERSON>, 71, and <PERSON> Tian </PERSON> <PERSON> Jiyun </PERSON>, 59. <PERSON> Yao </PERSON> and <PERSON> Tian </PERSON> previously served as vice premiers. Ten of the 41 ministers are new, as are seven of the nine state councilors. The average age of the premier, vice premiers and nine councilors dropped from 67 to 61. The state councilors include people closely identified with <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON>'s economic reforms and policy of opening to the outside world, such as new <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> Minister <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Tieying </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Chen </PERSON> <PERSON> Xitong </PERSON> and <PERSON> Chen </PERSON> <PERSON> Junsheng </PERSON>, who also retained his post of secretary general of the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>. One constitutional amendment guarantees the rights and interests of the 21.5 million Chinese now working in 13.7 million private businesses. Private entrepreneurs, operating small food and clothing stalls and restaurants, now account for almost 13 percent of the nation's total retail sales. The other amendment, also tied to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s policy of giving greater flexibility to its economy, states that `` the right to the use of land may be transferred according to law.'' <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> has experimented with transfer of land-use rights as part of efforts to provide land to more ambitious farmers and accelerate urban development. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s foreign policy is not expected to change under <PERSON> Qian </PERSON>, a career diplomat who spent 10 years in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and has headed China-Soviet normalization talks since 1982. <PERSON> Qian </PERSON>, who also has been <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s spokesman on disarmament issues, speaks English and Russian. Under Wu, foreign minister since November 1982, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> has maintained a course of neutrality in superpower disputes, increased economic and political ties with the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION>, eased tensions with <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> and championed Third World causes. <PERSON> Qin </PERSON> <PERSON> Jiwei </PERSON>, a close confidante of <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaoping </PERSON> who served under <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> in the wars against <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and the Nationalists, is expected to lead efforts to restore the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>'s authority over the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>. Among other major appointments, Premier <PERSON> Li </PERSON> took over the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Restructuring </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economy </ORGANIZATION>, which is responsible for setting guidelines for <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s market-oriented reforms. Vice Premier <PERSON> Yao </PERSON> <PERSON> Yilin </PERSON> was confirmed as head of the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Planning </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, newly created out of two commissions. <PERSON> Li </PERSON> and <PERSON> Yao </PERSON> are both regarded as more cautious than party head <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> toward reforms designed to substitute central planning with market-determined production. Their leadership over the two key economic commissions could slow down the pace of new reform initiatives in coming years. <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Senmao </PERSON>, 58, was named railways minister to succeed <PERSON> Ding </PERSON> <PERSON> Guangen </PERSON>, who was forced to resign last month following a string of fatal accidents. <PERSON> Li </PERSON> has been vice minister since 1982. <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Guixian </PERSON>, a Soviet-trained engineer who was party chief in <LOCATION> Anhui </LOCATION> province, was named governor of the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> China </ORGANIZATION>, succeeding <PERSON> Chen </PERSON> <PERSON> Muhua </PERSON>, one of the highest-ranking women in the government.

 <PERSON> Li </PERSON>, a provincial party leader with little experience in finance, was the surprise choice to fill the difficult post of governor of the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> China </ORGANIZATION>, the country's central bank. The 50-year-old <PERSON> Li </PERSON>, a Soviet-trained engineer who since 1986 has been party secretary in <LOCATION> Anhui </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Province </LOCATION>, also became one of nine state councilors named by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>.

A few weeks later, 28 people were killed in the fourth accident, the collision of two passenger trains in <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION>. Investigations revealed deep-seated problems in the Railways Ministry's administration, including the lack of a safety control system, serious overloading of trains, outdated equipment, loose discipline, poor worker training and frequent thefts of railway materials. <PERSON> Li </PERSON> was a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s 12th <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> but was downgraded last October to an alternate membership in the policy-making body when it was reduced from 210 members to 175.

<HEAD>Cabinet Leader Promises Flexibility For American Firms</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOSEPH B. FRAZIER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A Cabinet minister said <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> will be flexible with American companies caught between local law and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economic sanctions aimed at ousting the nation's strongman, Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. In another development, hundreds of teachers peacefully demonstrated on Monday, chanting `` We do n't want communism!'' and `` Pineapple-face, you must go!'' a reference to <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s jowly, pockmarked face. The teachers demonstrated more than two hours at the <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> Monday, demanding to be paid. Opposition leaders plan daily demonstrations throughout the week, even though recent protests in the 10-month campaign by the opposition to oust <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> have been poorly attended or blocked by police. The problem faced by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> companies was discussed Monday by <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> Minister <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Rognoni </PERSON> at a meeting with 30 representatives of American companies. `` The way the act has come out, if they comply with the Panamanian laws they are defying the American law and if they comply with the American law they are defying the Panamanian law. We hope to find a medium solution,'' he said. On Friday, President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> invoked a law banning Americans and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> companies from making tax and other payments to the government. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, head of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s 15,000-member Defense Forces and the power behind the civilian government, is under separate indictments by two federal grand juries in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> on narcotics trafficking charges. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> recognizes <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Arturo </PERSON> <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> as <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s president <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> ordered the tax payments to be directed into an escrow account set up for <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON>, who was deposed in February after trying to fire <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. The order was the latest in a string of economic sanctions enacted by the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration in a bid to force <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> to step down. <PERSON> Rognoni </PERSON> said the government is looking for ways to keep American companies operating in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, where <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> investment totals about $ 3.5 billion. Much depends on how <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> interprets the law, he said. `` We are sad that the measures are going to affect American companies that have been traditionally friends of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, that have been part of our development,'' <PERSON> Rognoni </PERSON> said. `` They have been with us many decades, some of them from the start of our country.'' <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Denton </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Rognoni </PERSON> made no threats against American companies. The <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> is expected to issue clearer guidelines and exceptions to the order soon. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> previously ordered $ 50 million in Panamanian funds frozen in American banks, provoking an economic crisis that has kept Panamanian banks closed since March 3. The government has failed to meet public payrolls for over a month. Panamanians with paychecks have been unable to cash them or gain access to their savings. Panamanian industry could be `` virtually paralyzed'' within two months because of the bank closures, said <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Valencia </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Panama </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industrial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. He said half the country's industry already was idle and construction had halted. The only industries that could expect to continue operating under current conditions were those that relied upon domestic raw materials or were producing essential food and beverage items, <ORGANIZATION> Valencia </ORGANIZATION> said. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s departure as head of the military and the democratization of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> are essential conditions to solve the crisis, he said.

<HEAD>Shrimper Describes 12-Day Ordeal in Gulf of Mexico</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CRYSTAL RIVER, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A boater who spent 12 days drifting in the Gulf of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> without food or water wanted to see his 5-year-old daughter before he died, but perished hours before rescuers arrived, said a friend who survived. <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Daniels </PERSON>, 19, describing the ordeal shared by him and <PERSON> Jimmie </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Thacker </PERSON> from his hospital bed in this Gulf Coast city on Monday, said he had daydreams about grape soda and ice cream while adrift. <PERSON> Daniels </PERSON>, who was rescued Saturday, was in stable condition today after being moved out of the intensive care unit at <ORGANIZATION> Seven </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rivers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>. He was being treated for hypothermia, sunburn, starvation and dehydration, said a nursing supervisor who asked that her name not be used. <PERSON> Thacker </PERSON>, 25, died late Friday or early Saturday. `` All I know is that he wanted to see his little girl again before he died,'' said <PERSON> Daniels </PERSON>, a shrimper. <PERSON> Thacker </PERSON> was separated from his wife and 5-year-old girl, who live in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>. The ordeal began March 28, when <PERSON> Daniels </PERSON> and <PERSON> Thacker </PERSON> went to Anclote Key, an island north of <LOCATION> Tarpon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION>, in a 14-foot skiff with two friends. At dusk, <PERSON> Daniels </PERSON> and <PERSON> Thacker </PERSON> left the island to get matches and more soft drinks. They never came back. Their friends got back to the mainland the next morning by hitching a ride from a passing fisherman and told family members about the disappearence, prompting a <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> search the next day. The searchers gave up a week later. <PERSON> Daniels </PERSON> said the shore was out of sight when the boat lost power. They drifted south and west, and lost their bearings. All he and <PERSON> Thacker </PERSON> had to drink were two bottles of <ORGANIZATION> Pepsi </ORGANIZATION>, which they emptied the first night so they could use them to bail out the boat after it was drenched by 16-foot waves. `` I did n't use my head. I freaked out,'' <PERSON> Daniels </PERSON> said. `` I could have used the engine cover'' to bail. Desperate for water, <PERSON> Daniels </PERSON> daydreamed and used saltwater to rinse his mouth. He said he spent much of his time praying. On several occasions, porpoises came to the boat and lifted their snouts, apparently to see if the men had any fish for them. `` Seeing the porpoises made me feel better,'' <PERSON> Daniels </PERSON> said. When they had been adrift for several days, a big shrimp boat came into view. Believing help had finally come, <PERSON> Daniels </PERSON> picked up the engine box and began waving it frantically to get the other boat's attention `` I was yelling and hollering at the top of my lungs and everything,'' he said. But the other boat did n't approach. `` It just kept going,'' <PERSON> Daniels </PERSON> said. `` One person on board raised his hand and waved as the boat pulled away.'' <PERSON> Daniels </PERSON> was rescued when a charter boat spotted him 14 miles west of <LOCATION> Crystal </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>. Despite his experience, he said he's looking forward to getting back to work on the Gulf. `` It's my home away from home,'' <PERSON> Daniels </PERSON> said. `` It's how I make my living.''

<TEXT>
 A mostly Mormon jury will sit in judgment of four members of a renegade polygamist clan charged in the bombing of a Mormon chapel and the subsequent 13-day standoff with police. Federal prosecutors plan to call at least 150 witnesses, including a Mormon bishop, neighbors of the defendants and reporters, in the high-profile case beginning today. Defense lawyers, however, are n't sure it can be judged fairly. Attorney <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Metos </PERSON>, asked if the 12 jurors seated Friday, truly were the defendants' peers, responded, `` They have no peers.'' A <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> correction officer was killed in an exchange of gunfire at the end of the siege. The <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> attorney general's office plans to file homicide charges as soon as the federal trial ends, said Associate Attorney General <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Warner </PERSON>. The trial will be one of the most closely followed in recent memory in a state with an estimated 30,000 members of polygamist families. Most coexist peacefully with their Mormon neighbors, who make up nearly 70 percent of <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>'s population. The <ORGANIZATION> Mormon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> renounced polygamy in 1890 and now excommunicates advocates and practitioners of multiple-wife marriages. The four defendants include <PERSON> Vickie </PERSON> <PERSON> Singer </PERSON>, 44, mother of seven and widow of slain polygamist <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Singer </PERSON>, who was gunned down in 1979 by police serving a contempt citation at the same farm where his family held authorities at bay while awaiting the dead patriarch's resurrection. Law enforcement officers believe Mrs. Singer was the brains behind the bombing and standoff, while her son-in-law, <PERSON> Addam </PERSON> <PERSON> Swapp </PERSON>, provided the muscle. According to Mrs. <PERSON> Singer </PERSON>'s diary, submitted as evidence during pretrial hearings, <PERSON> Swapp </PERSON> and two others planted the bomb at the <ORGANIZATION> Kamas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stake </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Marion </LOCATION> on Jan. 16 as the Singer women prayed at the family home two miles away. <PERSON> Swapp </PERSON>, 27, and Mrs. Singer are charged with seven and eight counts, respectively, in a nine-count indictment that was handed up shortly after their arrests. It was reduced last week to eight counts when <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jenkins </PERSON> dismissed a conspiracy charge. Charged with four counts each are <PERSON> Jonathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Swapp </PERSON>, 21, <PERSON> Addam </PERSON> <PERSON> Swapp </PERSON>'s brother, and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Singer </PERSON>, Mrs. Singer's 21-year-old wheelchair-bound son. Singer is state authorities' prime suspect in the slaying of the corrections officer. All four defendants are charged with the attempted killing of <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents during the standoff, assault on federal officers and two firearms violations. Mrs. Singer and <PERSON> Swapp </PERSON> are charged additionally with using an explosive to damage the chapel, use of a bomb and possession of a bomb. Mrs. Singer also faces one count of possession of a sawed-off shotgun. In telephone calls to news organizations shortly after the bombing, Mrs. Singer and <PERSON> Swapp </PERSON> said the blast was symbolic of the `` collapse of the church, state and nation'' that would occur with the second coming of Christ and the return of <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Singer </PERSON>. Clan members contend Singer's death was the result of a `` government-church conspiracy'' and a `` long train of abuse'' against the family. <PERSON> Addam </PERSON> <PERSON> Swapp </PERSON>'s attorneys asked that the trial be moved out of state, arguing their client could not receive a fair hearing in Mormon-dominated <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>. While <PERSON> Jenkins </PERSON> has not ruled on the motion, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Bucher </PERSON>, an attorney for <PERSON> Swapp </PERSON>, said Monday the case probably would not be transferred once the trial begins. <PERSON> Bucher </PERSON> and <PERSON> Metos </PERSON>, representing <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Singer </PERSON>, said the pool of 170 prospective jurors that reported for possible court duty last week was 90 percent Mormon.

<TEXT>
 An investigator today ruled out the possibility that the hijackers of a Kuwaiti airliner smuggled their weapons on board the plane in <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION> through a ramp area used by service personnel. The possibility was raised on Monday by <PERSON> Rodney </PERSON> <PERSON> Wallis </PERSON>, head of security for the Montreal-based <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. The Kuwaiti jet was carrying 112 people when it was hijacked April 5 on a flight from <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> and forced down in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. The hijackers, who are armed with grenades and handguns, later forced the plane to <LOCATION> Larnaca </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>, where they have killed two of the approximately 50 passengers they are still holding hostage. `` It is not possible,'' Group Capt. <PERSON> Anake </PERSON> <PERSON> Udit </PERSON> said today when asked about <PERSON> Wallis </PERSON>' theory. <PERSON> Anake </PERSON>, a deputy managing director of the Airports Authority of <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>, is a member of a team investigating what happened during the 15 hours the <ORGANIZATION> Kuwait </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> jumbo jet was on the ground in <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION>. `` Anyone going through the ramp area had to go through tough security clearance,'' <PERSON> Anake </PERSON> said in a telephone interview. `` That is not easy.'' On Monday, <PERSON> Wallis </PERSON> said: `` On the basis of discussions we've had so far, the probability is that weapons were placed on board the aircraft through the coercion or collusion of staff on the ramp.'' The <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> is an international association of commercial airlines. <PERSON> Anake </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Kuwait </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> hires guards from the airport authority and from a private security firm to guard its planes while in <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION>. `` The security men do not take their eyes off the plane once it landed,'' he said. <PERSON> Anake </PERSON> said the airport authority has not discussed the origin of the weapons with the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. `` We expected suppositions like this and we're saying -LRB- the weapons -RRB- did n't come from here.'' Thai investigators have theorized that the weapons were smuggled aboard before the plane reached <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION> on April 4 from <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>. They said the hijackers may have left the weapons on board during the stop. On the possible coercion or collusion of staff on the ramp, <PERSON> Anake </PERSON> said: `` It was more likely they -LRB- the hijackers -RRB- used their own people.'' He said airport authority investigators were questioning about 100 people, including guards of the private security company and airport authority personnel, including cleaners, mechanics, engineers and employees of the <ORGANIZATION> Bangkok </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fuel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Anake </PERSON> said he could not say when the probe would be completed. A separate investigation team is headed by Interior Minister <PERSON> Prachuab </PERSON> <PERSON> Suntrangkoon </PERSON>.

<HEAD>Thatcher Introduces Radical Changes In Welfare</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Housing subsidies and most free school meals have ended for needy Britons under Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s revamping of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s 43-year-old welfare system, the latest target in her war against socialism Pensioners presented a petition at Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s Downing Street office after the changes went into effect Monday. The legislation allowing the changes was approved 18 months ago. But the implementation of the program has rekindled outcries among opposition legislators and social welfare groups. Legislators from Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> expected renewed opposition when <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> resumes today. The changes affect 8.6 million people, including 1 million of the poor whose housing subsidies will end. But <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> said Monday that the plan would raise benefits for low-income working families and give disabled people higher payments. Under the plan, most free school meals are taken away and most grants with which the needy can buy beds and stoves have been changed to interest-free loans. Revamping of the welfare system is the third part of a Thatcher government program that has curbed state spending and greatly reduced the power of labor unions. `` For us, the quality of life has just slipped a notch,'' said <PERSON> Reg </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON>, 73, a retired carpenter whose benefits drop by about $ 5 a week. He and his wife, <PERSON> Katherine </PERSON>, live in a subsidized apartment in <LOCATION> Kingston </LOCATION>, outside <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. Most of their $ 173.50 weekly income is from state pensions, which remain the same, but cuts in housing subsidies leave the couple worse off. Critics in the socialist <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> accuse Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> of a fundamental attack on the welfare state, established by a <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> administration </ORGANIZATION> in 1945 and expanded by every government since. Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> says she is not cutting the $ 86 billion welfare bill, which represents is one-tenth of the nation's gross national product, but refocusing it on the truly needy. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>, secretary for social services, says the idea is to wean Britons from the `` dependency culture.'' Some may lose their free stoves and beds, the argument goes, but $ 750 million is reserved for those prepared to hold low-paid jobs rather than depend only on welfare. `` Your targets are nonsense,'' <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> Kinnock </PERSON> declared in an angry exchange with the prime minister in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commons </ORGANIZATION>. `` Your ` reform' is often a little extra to the very worst-off, paid by those who are the next worst-off. The result will inevitably be a spread of poverty.'' While a poor family such as the Whites loses about $ 5 a week, taxes for an executive making the equivalent of $ 187,000 a year fall by $ 65 a day. Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> said welfare expenditure would rise next year by about $ 3.75 billion, and added: `` What you're saying is that you can never, ever have a restructuring of social security if anyone loses. That's an absolutely ridiculous thing to say.'' Bishop <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Jenkins </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Durham </LOCATION>, fourth-ranking prelate in the Church of <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, described the welfare reform as `` verging on the wicked.'' Conflicting statistics abound. Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> says only 12 percent of claimants will be worse off but the government-appointed <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advisory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> puts it at 43 percent, with 38 percent better off. Most of those affected, about one-seventh of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s 56 million people, are individuals or families whose incomes are from welfare, state pensions or weekly wages ranging from about $ 150 - $ 225 The average weekly wage in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> is $ 450, and basic welfare for a childless unemployed couple remains at $ 99 a week.

 A series of explosions and a fire at an oil field supply manufacturing plant early today forced the evacuations of nearby residents, authorities said. Two plant employees suffered minor injuries, and were treated and released at a <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION> hospital. The explosion was at the <ORGANIZATION> Owens </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tool </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, located between <PERSON> Godley </PERSON> and <PERSON> Cresson </PERSON>, about 25 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION>. Authorities said they ordered the evacuations of about 30 people from a square mile of the mostly rural area around the plant because they believed 20,000 to 30,000 pounds of explosives were stored in the area. <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> <PERSON> Owens </PERSON>, the plant's owner, said a charge being manufactured for use in oil drilling operations exploded, triggering other explosions and a fire. The plant was destroyed, he said. Firefighters from several surrounding towns, and volunteers battled the blaze, but were pulled back at times because of fears of possible additional explosions. The evacuees were taken to the <ORGANIZATION> Godley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, where they were told to wait until it was safe to return home.

<TEXT>
 Gov. <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> <PERSON> Mofford </PERSON> has joined those who want the May 17 recall election canceled on grounds she should n't have to risk removal when the recall was aimed at her predecessor, the ousted <PERSON> Evan </PERSON> <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> The <ORGANIZATION> Arizona </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> was scheduled to hear arguments today on a taxpayers' lawsuit that seeks cancellation of the special vote. Holding the election would `` provide that Governor Mofford could be removed from office by virtue of recall petitions aimed against Governor <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>,'' according to a legal brief filed Monday by Mrs. <PERSON> Mofford </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON>. `` The Constitution does not provide for removal of the governor by a recall aimed at her predecessor,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Mofford </PERSON>'s brief said. <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> was removed from office April 4 after an impeachment conviction by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, and Mrs. <PERSON> Mofford </PERSON> was sworn in the next day. Attorney General <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Corbin </PERSON>, defending acting Secretary of State <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> Osborne </PERSON> in the suit, contended last week that nothing in the Constitution permits the cancellation of a recall election once it has been scheduled. Democrat <PERSON> Carolyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Warner </PERSON>'s lawyer also filed a brief Monday urging that the election be called off. Mrs. <PERSON> Warner </PERSON>, who had been campaigning for the job, has said she will ask that her name be removed from the ballot if Mrs. <PERSON> Mofford </PERSON> is allowed to run. But Republican candidates <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Rhodes </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Londen </PERSON> and independent <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Oertle </PERSON> <PERSON> Sr. </PERSON> filed papers saying the recall should be held because the people who signed petitions indicated they want to choose their next governor. <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>'s spokesman, <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>, said the former governor was not filing papers in the case. However, he said that if the court rules the recall must be held, <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> expects to file suit in an effort to get his name reinstated on the ballot. Ms. <PERSON> Osborne </PERSON> last week removed <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>'s name after <PERSON> Corbin </PERSON> said he is not entitled to run because he is no longer governor. Mrs. <PERSON> Mofford </PERSON>'s brief contended she should not have to face removal from office so soon after taking over the governorship. `` Governor <PERSON> Mofford </PERSON> has not been impeached,'' <ORGANIZATION> Campbell </ORGANIZATION>'s brief said. `` Neither has anyone circulated petitions demanding her recall. Indeed, no such petitions could be circulated because she has held office for only one wweek.'' The constitution requires a public official to be in office for at least six months before a recall petition campaign can be started. Mrs. <PERSON> Mofford </PERSON>'s name was put on the ballot following a draft campaign, and she has thus far avoided declaring her own candidacy for fear of running afoul of <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>'s `` resign to run'' law. Mrs. <PERSON> Warner </PERSON>'s petition said the recall should be canceled because `` those individuals who signed recall petitions were specifically petitioning to recall the then-Gov. <PERSON> Evan </PERSON> <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> from office.'' She also noted that if the recall were held and Mrs. Mofford were beaten by another candidate, she would not be entitled to return to her former position as secretary of state. A petition filed by <PERSON> Rhodes </PERSON>' attorney said it would be `` an abuse of discretion'' for Ms. <PERSON> Osborne </PERSON> to cancel the recall election. <PERSON> Londen </PERSON>'s brief said he already had spent more than $ 200,000 for his candidacy on billboards, television ads, literature and staff. <PERSON> Oertle </PERSON>'s brief said that canceling the vote would violate his constitutional right to hold office.

 A <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leader criticized <PERSON> Prince </PERSON> <PERSON> Charles </PERSON>' outspokenness on social issues, saying the 39-year-old future monarch's `` problem'' is he's never been allowed to take responsibility for anything. <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> Tebbit </PERSON>, former chairman of the governing party and seen as a potential successor to Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>, said the prince sympathizes with the jobless, for example, because `` in a way he's got no job.'' <PERSON> Tebbit </PERSON> made the remarks during a <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> documentary called `` <PERSON> Charles </PERSON>, Prince of Conscience,'' broadcast Monday, which outlined the controversy surrounding the prince's forthright comments and his reported dissatisfaction with a life of protocol and polo The monarch is constitutionally barred from political involvement, and other members of the royal family traditionally refrain from commenting on politically sensitive topics. The eldest son of Queen <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON>, however, often has spoken out about inner-city decay, conditions of the poor and jobless, and architecture. His stands on stimulating inner cities have reportedly differed from the government's and irritated Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Opposition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> politicians criticized <PERSON> Tebbit </PERSON>'s remarks as `` foolish,'' saying they indicated Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s government was trying to stifle criticism. Two major newspapers, in editorials Monday based on pre-broadcast reports of the interview, also defended <PERSON> Charles </PERSON>. In the <ORGANIZATION> BBC </ORGANIZATION> program, <PERSON> Tebbit </PERSON> said <PERSON> Charles </PERSON>' outspoken comments would be dangerous only if `` he went too far, if he advocated a socialist solution, a <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> solution.'' But when asked if he saw a risk in Charles' outspokenness, <PERSON> Tebbit </PERSON> said, `` Perhaps it is a sign of his own impatience with his own life, which is very restrictive in what he can do and say.'' `` Now, whether his judgment is always right or not, well, we all have our opinions about that,'' said <PERSON> Tebbit </PERSON>, who left the <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> to care for his wife. Mrs. <PERSON> Tebbit </PERSON> was severely injured a 1985 Irish Republican Army bombing. He said, `` any criticism -LRB- by <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> -RRB- of the world as it is sounds like a criticism of the government.'' `` I suppose the Prince of <LOCATION> Wales </LOCATION> naturally feels extra sympathy towards those who've got no job,'' <PERSON> Tebbit </PERSON> said, `` because in a way he's got no job and he's prohibited from having a job until he inherits the throne.'' Although approaching middle age, the prince has `` not been able to take responsibility and authority for anything,'' he said. `` I think that is really his problem.'' <PERSON> Charles </PERSON>, in a <ORGANIZATION> BBC </ORGANIZATION> interview last year, said `` it would be easier to lead a quieter life'' but that he was `` driven'' to try to help the poor. `` I do n't need to do this, but I feel strongly about a lot of these things and I can not do nothing about it,'' said <PERSON> Charles </PERSON>, who heads several programs to help the poor and disadvantaged youths. On architecture, <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> called one planned museum addition `` a monstrous carbuncle'' and dubbed another planned building `` a glass stump.'' In both cases the plans were scrapped. While many have applauded <PERSON> Charles </PERSON>'s criticisms, some architects have complained that as a man who is neither elected nor possessed of any architectural qualifications, he has no right to make such attacks. Most recently, he rekindled controversy surrounding his position by telling journalists he `` was determined not to be confined to cutting ribbons,'' <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> reported in February. Palace officials have stoutly denied that the 62-year-old queen will abdicate to allow her son to become king. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Cunningham </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> spokesman on the environment, called <PERSON> Tebbit </PERSON>'s comments `` clearly foolish and almost offensive.'' He said he believed the public wanted their future monarch to understand their problems and the prince `` is demonstrating a real concern for the people of this country.'' Opposition lawmaker <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Grocott </PERSON> accused <PERSON> Tebbit </PERSON> of trying to silence such voices of opposition as trade unions and local government and `` it seems now he is trying to intimidate'' the monarchy as well. Public opinion polls have shown support for the prince's action and some desire even more outspokenness. A February survey in The Mail, a <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> newspaper, found 57 percent of the 1,086 adults asked said <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> should spend most of his time speaking out on controversial subjects.

 A reputed Mexican drug king was ordered held without bail on a 1980 narcotics indictment, while an indictment charging another alleged trafficker with heading a worldwide drug cartel was unsealed. <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Contreras </PERSON> <PERSON> Subias </PERSON> appeared before <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Magistrate <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Reichmann </PERSON> on Monday on an 8-year-old indictment for allegedly selling cocaine to undercover narcotics agents. <PERSON> Contreras </PERSON> <PERSON> Subias </PERSON>, who had been a fugitive since escaping from a Mexican jail in 1985, was captured April 1 in <LOCATION> Salt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. Authorities believe <PERSON> Contreras </PERSON> <PERSON> Subias </PERSON> was the right-hand man to alleged Mexican drug lord <PERSON> Rafael </PERSON> <PERSON> Caro </PERSON> <PERSON> Quintero </PERSON>, jailed in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> on charges of murdering <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> agent <PERSON> Enrique </PERSON> <PERSON> Camarena </PERSON> in 1985. Also Monday, <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramon </PERSON> <PERSON> Matta </PERSON> <PERSON> Ballesteros </PERSON>, 42, who authorities say ordered <PERSON> Camarena </PERSON>'s murder, was named in a 14-count indictment charging him with heading an organization that brought Colombian cocaine into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> via <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> between May 1983 and June 1985. <PERSON> Matta </PERSON> <PERSON> Ballesteros </PERSON> was arrested by <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION> marshals last week after he was expelled from his native <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>. The expulsion led to student riots in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> that included setting fire to a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> embassy annex there. <PERSON> Contreras </PERSON> <PERSON> Subias </PERSON> told <PERSON> Reichmann </PERSON> Monday that federal authorities have the wrong man. He claimed he is actually <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> <PERSON> Guillen </PERSON>, but prosecutors presented evidence that his fingerprints matched those taken during a 1985 arrest in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. He was scheduled to be arraigned in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> on Monday, prosecutors said. Nine people have been indicted in the <PERSON> Camarena </PERSON> slaying, and three are in custody, said Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Gurule </PERSON>. <PERSON> Matta </PERSON> <PERSON> Ballesteros </PERSON> is considered one of four prime suspects, said <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawn </PERSON>. According to the indictment, <PERSON> Matta </PERSON> <PERSON> Ballesteros </PERSON> shipped thousands of pounds of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> cocaine to <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. The narcotics were then flown to a remote air strip in Young, <LOCATION> Ariz. </LOCATION>, and moved in recreational vehicles to several `` safe houses'' in the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> area, the indictment said. The drug ring owned four airplanes, rented homes in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and set up several corporations, the indictment charged. The indictment also accused <PERSON> Matta </PERSON> <PERSON> Ballesteros </PERSON> of conspiracy, possession of cocaine with intent to distribute and running a continuing criminal enterprise.

He did, and ended up in a ditch with a broken arm and wrist, a broken collarbone and shoulder, a pelvis broken in three places and a broken heel and toe. Despite the injuries suffered in the accident Friday, and the fact that he was in intensive care at <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kansas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> with tubes going in and out of his body, <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION>, 31, and <PERSON> Rita </PERSON> <PERSON> Webb </PERSON>, 35, were married Saturday. Interviewed Monday in his hospital room, <PERSON> Cross </PERSON> said the gist of the ceremony was `` going after what you want in life and not letting things stand in your wy.'' <PERSON> Rita </PERSON>, now Mrs. <PERSON> Cross </PERSON>, joked that the only change in the ceremony was `` for worse or for better'' rather than the other way around. <PERSON> Cross </PERSON> said he had just left the 4-H building north of <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bend </LOCATION> where he, his fiancee and their family and friends had spent the day putting up wedding decorations. He was heading back home on his <ORGANIZATION> Harley-Davidson </ORGANIZATION> to pick up a camera to make pictures of their work. Cross said he was on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> 281 when he saw the car coming head-on and knew there was no way to avoid a collision. Mrs. <PERSON> Cross </PERSON> said she and friends and relatives spent a long night Friday in the intensive care unit. `` It was very serious all night long,'' she said. The next day the couple decided to go ahead with their wedding plans. The Rev. <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Ogel </PERSON> obliged. `` I admit I laughed a little when he said ` kiss the groom,''' said Mrs. <PERSON> Cross </PERSON>.

<TEXT>
 The Afghan accord to be signed this week represents a rare victory for <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> diplomacy in resolving regional conflicts. It also indicates the limitations of the world body. The <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> only is as good as its 159 members, only as constructive as they allow it to be, only effective when the superpowers embrace it. Nearly six years of intensive, intricate and innovative <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> diplomacy concerning the 10-year Afghan civil war finally paid off because it was in every party's interest. There were 12 rounds of <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> talks and nine shuttle missions since 1981. <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> have announced agreement on a package of measures providing for the withdrawal of the estimated 115,000 Soviet troops from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. The Marxist government of President <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> has been backed by Soviet soldiers in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> since 1979. The guerrilla forces are based in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> and armed primarily by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The Moslem guerrillas, who were not part of the U.N.-mediated talks, have rejected the accords and said they will press their fight to oust the <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> government. The <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> and its mediator, <PERSON> Diego </PERSON> <PERSON> Cordovez </PERSON>, played the role of catalyst and broker. The negotiated accord is to be signed Thursday in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>. A respected, neutral peacekeeper worldwide, the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> will monitor the political settlement and Soviet withdrawal. Last-minute disagreement between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> on cutting off aid to the guerrillas and the <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> government threatened to wreck the pact. A behind-the-scenes agreement between the superpowers, guarantors of the Afghan accord, cleared the way for success. Diplomatic sources said the two powers tacitly agreed to cut off aid to both sides or to provide an equal amount of supplies. The fundamental obstacle was cleared when the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> decided that <LOCATION> Afghan </LOCATION> intervention was too costly _ in money, lives, domestic politics and international image. <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> then announced it would withdraw its troops over a 10-month period begining May 15. No amount of <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> diplomacy could achieve a breakthrough until the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> was ready to leave, diplomats said. `` Diplomatic success is possible only when the moment is ripe,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Neumann </PERSON>, former <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassador to <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> and now director of <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Studies </LOCATION> at the <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> For </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Strategic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studies </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION> `` But statesmen like ambassador <PERSON> Cordovez </PERSON> have acted with great patience to ripen the time,'' <PERSON> Neumann </PERSON> said on Monday in a telephone interview. <PERSON> Neumann </PERSON>, envoy in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> from 1966 to 1973, said the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> had been hobbled because its charter prevents it from interfering in domestic affairs. Soviet insistence on a coalition government after its pullout had been an obstacle to political settlement. When that stance was abandoned, the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> could act. <PERSON> Neumann </PERSON> said <PERSON> Cordovez </PERSON> `` provided a catalyst as the principal but not the only actor since he was free to talk to all sides.'' <PERSON> Cordovez </PERSON> says the complicated Afghan accord, which includes five separate documents, could serve as a model for resolving other regional conflicts. The <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> faces numerous conflicts where its resolutions and diplomatic missions have had little or no effect: the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>. `` The <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> is extremely useful as a central point to carry on these kinds of negotiations, but it takes a lot of force from the outside to succeed,'' said a former senior <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> official familiar with the Afghan talks. `` The <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> has constructed a vehicle for peace in the hopes that someone will use it,'' said the official, speaking on condition his name not be used. `` The negotiating process itself is very valuable and keeps the conflict from spinning out of control. This honest broker is extremely important.'' Because <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> have no relations, their representatives refused to meet face-to-face. <PERSON> Cordovez </PERSON> shuttled not only between capitals but between rooms where the delegations met. He continually briefed the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and also met with Afghan guerrillas. Before the final round of talks, <PERSON> Cordovez </PERSON> told reporters: `` I am convinced that the parties to this accord, especially the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, are signing because they want to. It is in their self-interest and for that reason they also should honor it.'' `` The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> could stay in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> and they are not going to be pushed out,'' <PERSON> Cordovez </PERSON> said. `` But a military solution is not possible and the Soviets have agreed to a political solution because they wish to.''

<TEXT>
 Here is some background on the hijackers of the <ORGANIZATION> Kuwait </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> jetliner: WHO THEY ARE _ No identities have been disclosed. Arabs listening to radio conversations between three of the hijackers and the <LOCATION> Larnaca </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> control tower say their accents indicate that two are Lebanese, who recite from the Koran, <ORGANIZATION> Islam </ORGANIZATION>'s holy book, with Iranian inflections, and one is an Iraqi. There appears to be between five and seven Arab hijackers. <LOCATION> Bahrain </LOCATION> authorities say the Bahraini passports carried by five people in boarding the jumbo jetliner are forgeries. WHAT THEY WANT _ The hijackers main demand is the release of 17 terrorists, imprisoned in <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> for bombing the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and French embassies there in 1983. This is the same demand made by the pro-Iranian <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Moslem </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jihad </ORGANIZATION>, which is holding American and French hostages in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. All but one of the 17 terrorists in <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> are Shiite Moslems. Three have been sentenced to death. THEIR LINKS WITH <LOCATION> LEBANON </LOCATION> _ Two of the pro-Iranian, extremist <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> groups in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> have threatened to kill hostages they hold if the hijacked plane is stormed. Islamic Jihad threatened to kill two Americans, <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>' Chief Middle East Correspondent, and educator <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Sutherland </PERSON>, along with at least three <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> captives _ journalist <PERSON> Jean-Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Kauffman </PERSON> and diplomats <PERSON> Marcel </PERSON> <PERSON> Carton </PERSON> and <PERSON> Marcel </PERSON> <PERSON> Fontaine </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> of the Oppressed on <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> threatened to kill <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> Lt. <PERSON> Col </PERSON> <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>, kidnapped while serving with a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> observer group in south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. The hijackers flew to <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> on Friday, but Syrian forces controlling the airport refused to let them land and the plane went to <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>. THE IRAN CONNECTION _ The hijackers appear to be Shiite Moslems, like most of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s 50 million people and its revolutionary leader, <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>. The plane was initially forced to land in northeast <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. Prime Minister <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> <PERSON> Musavi </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> has condemned the hijacking as `` against Islamic principles'', but <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> allowed the plane to leave Friday after refueling it. The hijackers later sent greetings to their `` Iranian brothers'' and spoke in a statement Tuesday of the `` glory of the Imam <PERSON> Mahdi </PERSON>,'' a figure in Shiite theology who is to reappear as the Messiah. This belief is peculiar to Shiites.

 A bomb exploded early today outside a <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> office, slightly damaging a door and several parked cars but causing no injuries, police said. Similar bombs placed outside doors of three other <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> offices in this northeastern city emitted smoke but failed to go off, police said. No group immediately claimed responsibility for planting the bombs, but police said they suspected <PERSON> Terra </PERSON> <PERSON> Lliure </PERSON>, a small terrorist group that seeks independence for the four-province northeastern region of <LOCATION> Catalonia </LOCATION>. Police said the bombing occurred just before 2 a.m. and residents notified police of the other three bombs shortly afterward. <ORGANIZATION> Barcelona </ORGANIZATION> is the largest city in the Catalonian region and <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>'s second-largest city. Terra Lliure, which stands for Free Land in the Catalan language, has claimed numerous bombings in the region in the last three years.

<HEAD>Nixon Says Shultz's Efforts Will Go for Nought</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Former President <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> said today that only secret and prolonged negotiations can bring about a change in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> relations with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and that <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>'s efforts will go for nought in an election year `` You have to recongize that we can do nothing about those relations in an election year,'' said <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, too, is holding elections in 1988. In the secnd of three consecutive daily appearances on <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Today'' program, <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> suggested that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> use a heavyweight negotiator, whom he did not name today But on Sunday, on <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Meet the Press'', he suggested <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Kissinger </PERSON> for that role. The former president, who is making public appearances to promote a new book, `` 1999,'' also touched on these subjects: _ On others' global responsibility: `` Unless the Europeans do more in their own defense ... you are going to find the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> is going to reduce the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> presence without getting anything for it from the Russians.'' _ On the next president: He `` is going to be urged, the moment he gets in, to go running over to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> or have them come here. It would be the greatest mistake he can make.'' <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> suggested the first summit meeting should be without glamour or spouses and `` should go on for at least two weeks and we should develop a common strategy.'' _ On <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>: `` <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s first priority is progress at home. They've given up on expansion and aggression abroad ... -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Mikhail </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> has to choose. If he can get progress at home and give away aggression abroad, we can have the same relations with him that we do with the Chinese.'' <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> said he gives Secretary of State <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> high marks for his shuttle diplomacy in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> in recent weeks. `` But there is n't enough time to do it this year and it can not be done in an election year. I do n't want to say it's going to fail, because he's going to continue to try, but I say that 1989 is the optimum year to do it in. The Israelis, said <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>, should make their deal now `` because they are going to find that time is not on the side of the Israelis.'' Asked what he thinks might restrain the sometimes brutal behavior toward Arabs in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> said: `` They must not ignore the problem. They must not be blind to the fact that there are a million and a half Palestinians there who do n't have the right of self-government. And that's a time bomb that's going to explode. They have to deal with that or they are going to have great problems in the future.''

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> WINDHOEK </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South-West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- _ In a stinging rebuke to President P.W. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>, Archbishop <PERSON> Desmond </PERSON> <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON> today denied that he endorsed Marxism and said his fight against apartheid was deeply rooted in Christian tradition. <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON>, the first black to lead the Anglican Church in southern <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, released the text of a letter to <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> defending his challenges of government policy in a church-state confrontation that has intensified over the past two months. The Nobel Peace Prize laureate was responding to a March letter from <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> in which the South African president suggested <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON> was furthering the cause of the <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> guerrilla movement and promoting a Marxist dictatorship. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>, whose letter was quoted at length on South African television, asked whether <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON> was acting `` on behalf of the kingdom of God or the kingdom promised by the <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION>.'' Replied <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON>: `` I work for God's kingdom. For whose kingdom, with your apartheid policy, do you work for?'' `` I reject atheistic Marxism and I reject apartheid, which I find equally abhorrent,'' said <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON>. He cited numerous scriptural passages to support his contention that <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s policy of racial separation is `` unbiblical, un-Christian, immoral and evil.'' Referring to insinuations in <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>'s letter, <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON> said he had never listened to the <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION>'s radio broadcasts or read its magazine. `` My theological position derives from the Bible and the teachings of the Church,'' <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON> wrote. `` The Bible and the Church predate Marxism and the <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> by several centuries.'' <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON> is presiding this week over a synod of Anglican bishops in <LOCATION> South-West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> administers the territory, also known as <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>, in violation of a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> resolution. <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON> also offered to debate the morality of apartheid with a theologian from <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>'s Dutch Reformed Church. Apartheid establishes a racially segregated society in which the 26.5 million blacks have no vote in national affairs, but the 5 million whites control the economy and maintain separate districts, schools and health services. `` My position in this is not one of which I am ashamed ... I know that I stand in the mainline Christian tradition,'' he added. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> had chided <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON> for getting arrested, along with 25 other church leaders, when they tried to march on <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> six weeks ago to protest the bannings of 17 major anti-apartheid organizations and more than a dozen individuals. The clergymen have been trying to fill the political void created by the crackdown. <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON>, who leaves Saturday on a five-week trip to <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, asked <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> to ensure that his reply to the president was covered as prominently by state television as <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>'s March 16 letter to <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON> He also accused the president of falsely claiming that <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON> once preached under a communist banner. `` I pray for you, as I do for your ministerial colleagues, every day by name,'' <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON>'s letter concluded. `` God bless you.''

 The estate of murdered tobacco heiress <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Benson </PERSON> should be shared equally by the children of the son who killed her and by her daughter, a judge has ruled.

<TEXT>
 The <PERSON> Dalai </PERSON> <PERSON> Lama </PERSON>, the self-exiled leader of the Tibetan people, said today that Tibetans remain in constant fear of the Chinese government which rules their homeland. However, he said, he is increasingly hopeful that a solution to the Tibetan problem can be found. `` Many things are changing _ particularly in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> _ things are changing for the better, and generally speaking things are becoming more humanized. That is a positive and hopeful sign,'' the <PERSON> Dalai </PERSON> <PERSON> Lama </PERSON> told the Global Forum of Spiritual and Parliamentary Leaders on Human Survival, a gathering to discuss the planet's problems. The <PERSON> Dalai </PERSON> <PERSON> Lama </PERSON> is the spiritual and temporal leader of the Tibetan people. He fled <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION> in 1959 after an aborted uprising against Chinese rule. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> claims that <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION> has been part of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> for at least the past 700 years. Many Tibetans claim that <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION> is an independent state. Following a British stipulation, the <PERSON> Dalai </PERSON> <PERSON> Lama </PERSON>'s 30-minute speech eschewed politics, but when the 52-year-old Tibetan sat down, a questioner asked whether the 200 conference participants could help in any way to `` stop the suffering'' and restore <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION>'s religious and cultural freedom The <PERSON> Dalai </PERSON> <PERSON> Lama </PERSON> thanked the questioner and said he was continuing negotiations with <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> boycotted the conference in <LOCATION> Oxford </LOCATION> because of the <PERSON> Dalai </PERSON> <PERSON> Lama </PERSON>'s presence. In a letter to the <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> London </ORGANIZATION>, published Tuesday, Chinese Ambassador <PERSON> Ji </PERSON> <PERSON> Chaozhu </PERSON> defended his country's rule of <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION>. The letter welcomed the <PERSON> Dalai </PERSON> <PERSON> Lama </PERSON>'s `` intention to continue such contacts. Our only condition is that he does not demand ` independence' for <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION>, which we would never accept.'' The unique gathering of 200 personalities from more than 60 countries is trying to find ways of using their influence with national decision makers to tackle international issues like nuclear war, population control, violence, pollution and conservation. In the first keynote speech at the opening ceremony Monday in <LOCATION> Oxford </LOCATION> city hall, Archbishop of Canterbury <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Runcie </PERSON> admitted that religious differences were still `` the root cause of tensions and deep divisions between different human groups.'' `` It is premature to presume that the age of holy wars is long past,'' said <PERSON> Runcie </PERSON>, spiritual head of the state Church of <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> and leader of the world's 70 million Anglicans, including 3 million <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Episcopalians. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Lovelock </PERSON>, a British scientist concerned with saving the natural environment, said in a main theme speech prepared for delivery today: `` We face the hard task of reintegrating creation _ of learning again to be part of the <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> and not separate from it.'' <PERSON> Lovelock </PERSON>, who with <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON> <PERSON> Margulis </PERSON> formulated the Gaia theory that Earth itself is alive to the extent that it can regulate its climate and chemical composition, said tropical forests which helped to create the rain that sustains them, are being `` removed at a ruthless pace.''

 <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> today claimed its forces advanced into northeast <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, killing or wounding more than 2,000 Iraqis and capturing border highlands. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> said the assault was repulsed. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> reported it fired a long-range missile into <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> and two into the northwestern city of <LOCATION> Tabriz </LOCATION>. Shipping executives said <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> attacked and set ablaze a Saudi Arabian tanker in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> said there were civilian casualties in the attacks on its cities. It did not specify how many. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s official <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, monitored in <LOCATION> Nicosia </LOCATION>, claimed <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> warplanes today dropped chemical bombs on Iranian troops in <LOCATION> Sulaimaniyeh </LOCATION> province as <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s forces were losing ground in the latest offensive in the 7 -LCB- - year-old war <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION> said Iranian troops were equipped with gas masks and protective clothing, `` but many were injured.'' It did not elaborate. It said heavy fighting was raging after the Iranians overran 12 square miles of Iraqi territory. <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION> said Iranian jets twice bombed a headquarters of the <ORGANIZATION> Iraqi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>'s 1st Corps at <PERSON> Kani </PERSON> <PERSON> Mizan </PERSON>, west of <LOCATION> Penjwin </LOCATION>, `` inflicting heavy damage,'' and carried out 25 combat missions against ground targets. <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION> said the Iranians advanced across the mountainous frontier Monday night near <LOCATION> Penjwin </LOCATION>, seizing six `` strategic heights'' to gain a foothold in the region. That is 25 miles north of an <LOCATION> Iranian </LOCATION> bridgehead around <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Darbandikhan </LOCATION> seized in an offensive last month. In <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION>, the official news agency quoted an <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> military spokesman as saying the latest Iranian assault was beaten back, with 2,000 men killed or wounded. `` Many were captured while the others fled,'' the unidentified spokesman was quoted as saying. There was no independent confirmation of either side's claims. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> rarely allow correspondents into the battle zones. <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION> reported the advancing Iranians captured 235 Iraqis and destroyed 45 tanks and armored personnel carriers, 1,000 vehicles and 10 artillery guns. <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION> said gunners shot down an Iraqi PC-7 aircraft, a Swiss-built propellor-driven trainer that can be used in a combat role. In <LOCATION> Manama </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Bahrain </LOCATION>, shipping executives reported the raid on the 36,904-ton Sagheera, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s first attack on gulf shipping this month. The tanker was hit at 1 p.m. -LRB- 5 a.m. EDT -RRB- off the emirate of <PERSON> Ras </PERSON> <PERSON> al-Khaimah </PERSON> in the southern gulf as it was sailing out of the waterway with a full load of <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> oil, said the executives, speaking on condition of anonymity. The executives said the tanker's bow was set on fire. The Iranians challenged the Sagheera by radio, demanding its destination and cargo, before it was attacked, the executives said. The <ORGANIZATION> Iraqi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> agency reported the Iraqis fired a long-range missile into <LOCATION> Tabriz </LOCATION> today. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> said the missile hit a hospital for lepers, but said no reports on casualties was available. <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION> reported on Monday that Iranian-backed Iraqi rebels have killed 680 Iraqi soldiers and destroyed four bases in northeast <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> in the last few days. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> said it fired two missiles at `` two key military targets'' in the <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> capital of <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION> on Monday in retaliation for <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> missiles that killed at least 20 civilians in <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Isfahan </LOCATION> earlier in the day. <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION> reported that Iranian artillery also shelled the battered the <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> port city of <LOCATION> Basra </LOCATION>, the naval base at Umm Qasr and three border towns Monday. The agency quoted the Iranian defense minister, Brig. Gen. <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> <PERSON> Jalali </PERSON>, as saying his country is now making most of its own missiles and is capable of `` turning <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION> into an inferno ... if the criminal attacks on Iranian cities continue.'' Since Feb. 29, the two sides have fired more than 300 missiles into each other's cities. At the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> on Monday, <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s deputy foreign minister, <PERSON> Wisam </PERSON> <PERSON> Alzahawi </PERSON>, said there is no point in continuing talks on ending the Iran-Iraq war until <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> accepts a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> peace plan. The <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> passed a resolution in July 1987 demanding an immediate cease-fire and troop withdrawal as the first steps toward a negotiated end to the war. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> endorsed the resolution; <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> has yet to do so.

 An injured man riding unattended in the back of an ambulance fell out onto the road and had to hitchhike the rest of the way to the hospital, Italian newspapers reported today. The reports said <PERSON> Carmine </PERSON> <PERSON> Urciuolo </PERSON>, 23, a native of <LOCATION> Avellino </LOCATION>, 34 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Naples </LOCATION>, and the stretcher on which he lay fell out of the ambulance because the driver had not correctly closed the rear doors of the vehicle.

Urciuolo hitchhiked to the hospital and was treated for minor injuries.

<TEXT>
 There may be some good news in store for the salt marsh harvest mice that live in that soggy, swampy land along <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gallinas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Creek </LOCATION>. The city council is bruiting a ban on cats. The ban was proposed by city planners for a 224-home subdivision near the creek because of fears that housepets would hunt the endangered mice, which live only in the wetlands of the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> area. The <ORGANIZATION> Planning </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> also fears cats might hunt clapper rail birds, another endangered species. Under the measure, homeowners would be required to trap stray cats that venture into the marshland. But the measure may encounter some opposition when it shows up on the council agenda next week. `` It's ridiculous that the city's trying to restrict people from having animals,'' said Councilman <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Frugoli </PERSON>. `` We'll be the laughingstock of everybody.'' <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Garlinghouse </PERSON>, a spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> Southwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Diversified </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, the developer of the housing project, called the cat ban a `` reasonable compromise'' with environmentalists. He said construction is expected to start this summer. But <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Marin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Humane </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> said the ban might be unenforceable. `` Dogs are hard enough to catch,'' she said.

<HEAD>50,000 Soviet Soldiers to Leave Within Three Months</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A Soviet Foreign Ministry official told Italian parliamentarians today that 50,000 Soviet soldiers will be withdrawn from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> within three months beginning May 15, an Italian source said. The statement by First Deputy Foreign Minister <PERSON> Yuli </PERSON> <PERSON> Vorontsov </PERSON> appeared to be the first time an official source gave any indication of the size of the Soviet force in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. Under an accord to be signed Thursday in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> will agree to remove all of its soldiers from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> within nine months of May 15, the first half of them by Aug. 15. The figure provided by <PERSON> Vorontsov </PERSON> would make the size of the Soviet force about 100,000 soldiers. Western sources have estimated there are 115,000 Soviet soldiers in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, but the Soviets never have provided a figure. The Italian source attended the meeting but spoke on condition he not be further identified. <PERSON> Vorontsov </PERSON> told the group of eight Italian lawmakers that half of the Soviet force would leave <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> within three months, and `` he mentioned 50,000 soldiers,'' the source said. Soviet <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Vadim </PERSON> <PERSON> Perfilyev </PERSON>, speaking at a regular news briefing today, said he could not give a figure for the number of Soviet soldiers in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Perfilyev </PERSON> indicated that Soviet Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>, who will sign agreements to guarantee the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> accord, also may meet separately to discuss other issues. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> will be in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> a week later to continue negotiations for a 50 percent cut in strategic nuclear weapons, but `` it ca n't be ruled out that there will be a meeting dealing with a broad range of topics'' in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Perfilyev </PERSON> said The Italian delegation that met with <PERSON> Vorontsov </PERSON> was headed by <PERSON> Christian </PERSON> <PERSON> Democrat </PERSON> <PERSON> Flaminio </PERSON> <PERSON> Piccoli </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> of the Italian Chamber of Deputies. <PERSON> Vorontsov </PERSON> did not provide any further details on the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> forces in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, but said that the soldiers would begin taking up positions to begin withdrawing in a month, the Italian source said. <PERSON> Vorontsov </PERSON> reportedly said nothing about the arming of pro-Soviet Afghan government forces and Afghan guerrillas, who are supplied by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and other countries. U.S.-Soviet disagreement over the future of that aid held up the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> talks for several weeks before the two sides agreed that they could continue supplying weapons. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> had sought a symmetrical elimination of aid to government forces and the Moslem guerrillas. But the Soviets refused to go along, saying the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> interjected the demand at the last minute and that <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> could not violate agreements with the Afghan government. Soviet soldiers entered <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> in December 1979 and replaced one pro-Soviet government with another. They remained to help government forces fight anti-Communist insurgents, many of whom have bases in neighboring <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>. The guerrillas have rejected the accords and said they will continue to fight to oust the <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> government.

 A rapist who cut off his victim's forearms says that when his parole ends April 25 he may visit <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>, where his mutilated victim was last known to be living <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Singleton </PERSON>, 60, who spent the first part of his parole shuttling from town to town when no community would accept him, said he plans to spend his `` first few days'' of freedom with a church group in <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Antioch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ledger </ORGANIZATION> reported Monday. He would not disclose the exact location and did not rule out a return to <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Contra </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, east of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. His victim, <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Vincent </PERSON>, has said she is frightened that <PERSON> Singleton </PERSON> could find her and harm her. <PERSON> Singleton </PERSON>, an ex-sailor, was convicted in 1979 of raping <PERSON> Vincent </PERSON>, then 15, and chopping off her forearms on Sept. 29, 1978. He was sentenced to a 14-year, four-month term but was released on parole last year for good behavior and through work credits. He has spent the last 10 months of his year-long parole in a mobile home on the grounds of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Quentin </LOCATION> state prison. Gov. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Deukmejian </PERSON> arranged for <PERSON> Singleton </PERSON> to live there following confrontations with politicians and residents of communities who did not want him in their cities. In July, state corrections officials considered allowing <PERSON> Singleton </PERSON> to serve his parole with a farm family in <LOCATION> Azalea </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ore. </LOCATION>, who wrote to <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> officials and offered <PERSON> Singleton </PERSON> a job as a handyman. <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> officials refused to grant permission for the move. <PERSON> Singleton </PERSON> did not say if he plans to live with the family, but when his parole ends he will be able to live where he pleases. <PERSON> Vincent </PERSON>, interviewed after <PERSON> Singleton </PERSON>'s parole, was reported by the Modesto Bee to be living at an undisclosed location in southern <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>. She said at the time she was scared that <PERSON> Singleton </PERSON> would find her and harm her again. With last year's protests in mind, authorities may take <PERSON> Singleton </PERSON> to an undisclosed site in the state before releasing him, said <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Chun </PERSON>, regional director of the state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corrections </ORGANIZATION>. If <PERSON> Singleton </PERSON> lives anywhere in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> said, he will have to register as a sex offender within 10 days. <PERSON> Singleton </PERSON> continues to insist he did not attack <PERSON> Vincent </PERSON>, portraying himself as a victim and the young woman as a drug-crazed kidnapper. <PERSON> Singleton </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ledger </ORGANIZATION> he is seeking a criminal investigation into his allegation that <PERSON> Vincent </PERSON> kidnapped him in 1978. `` -LRB- She -RRB- told me that if I did not comply with her wishes she would poke out my eyes, smash my face, and hurt, hurt, hurt me and say that I raped her,'' <PERSON> Singleton </PERSON> wrote in a request for <PERSON> Vincent </PERSON>'s arrest, a copy of which he gave to the Ledger The typed request says <PERSON> Singleton </PERSON> picked up <PERSON> Vincent </PERSON> hitchhiking in <LOCATION> Berkeley </LOCATION> and that she began smoking the drug PCP.

 Teams from several state and federal agencies searched today for a whale that swam about 70 miles up the <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, attracting flocks of boaters despite warnings it could damage small craft. The 40-foot whale, first reported by a tugboat crew, was last seen just before nightfall Monday at the <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> Memorial Bridge, which crosses the <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> about 25 miles south of <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, officials said. Personnel from <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> marine police, <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> and the state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Natural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> went out in boats after daybreak to try to find and identify the marine mammal, said <PERSON> Kathleen </PERSON> <PERSON> Jamison </PERSON>, a public information officer with the natural resources department. `` It's such a gray day here that it's not going to be easy to spot it,'' Ms. <PERSON> Jamison </PERSON> said. The search crews hoped to guide the whale, of undetermined species, back out to sea, she said. The last time a live whale was seen so far up the heavily industrialized <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> was in 1890, said <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Schoelkopf </PERSON>, a nationally recognized whale expert who directs the <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mammal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stranding </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Brigantine </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION> `` It could be sick; it could be an old animal dying; it could have been hit by a boat and dazed,'' <PERSON> Schoelkopf </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> was concerned both with the safety of the public and the whale, which `` was just swimming around in circles,'' said Chief Warrant Officer <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Foy </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Gloucester </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION> ` A large freighter could kill the whale,'' he said. `` And if a pleasure boat got too close, he could swish his tail and really pose a hazard to small craft. We'll just try to entice it, coax it, herd it, whatever you do with a whale, to try to get him back to deep water where he belongs.'' `` When we reached the <LOCATION> Wilmington </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Terminal </LOCATION> area, it came up right in front of the boat,'' said <PERSON> Joyce </PERSON> <PERSON> Hennessey </PERSON>, a state <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> officer. `` We have a 28-foot -LRB- boat -RRB-, and it was bigger than that. I would estimate it at 40 feet.'' `` The <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> is recommending that recreational and private vessels exercise extreme caution in transitting the <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> in the vicinity of the <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> Memorial Bridge due to the size and temperament of the whale,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> Petty Officer <PERSON> Keith </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferguson </PERSON>. `` The whale could inflict serious damage to a small boater.'' Boaters, however, ignored warnings and flocked to the river to catch sight of the whale. `` I've never seen anything like this before in all my life,'' said <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Boyd </PERSON>. `` We saw him first at 4:30. He broke water and jumped in the air,'' said <PERSON> Gerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Cichocki </PERSON>. `` You'll know when he's coming up. You'll hear him snort and spray, then come up.''

The kidnappers had escaped in a hijacked van after a shootout with police. The guilty pleas followed two adjournments that delayed the proceedings at <LOCATION> Dublin </LOCATION>'s anti-terrorist Special Criminal Court for an hour. Scores of armed police and soldiers were posted around the courthouse. An army helicopter hovered overhead when an armed convoy escorting the defendants arrived from a top-security prison in <LOCATION> Portlaoise </LOCATION>, 50 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Dublin </LOCATION>. The defendants each admitted to falsely imprisoning 38-year-old <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Grady </PERSON>. O'Hare also pleaded guilty to maliciously wounding <PERSON> O'Grady </PERSON> with intent to maim. Other lesser charges were dropped. There was no immediate explanation of why the guilty pleas were made. Prosecution and defense lawyers were expected to outline the pleas in proceedings later today. Sentencing was expected Wednesday. The kidnappers chopped off tips of two of <PERSON> O'Grady </PERSON>'s fingers during his 22 days in captivity, authorities said. He was freed by police after detectives chanced upon the gang in a <LOCATION> Dublin </LOCATION> house on Nov. 5. Published reports said they had demanded a $ 2.5 million ransom, but police said nothing had been paid. <LOCATION> O'Hare </LOCATION>, 29, is from <LOCATION> Ballymacauley </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Armagh </LOCATION>. Two other <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> defendants are <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> McNeill </PERSON>, 25, of <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION>; and <PERSON> Fergal </PERSON> <PERSON> Toal </PERSON>, 25, of the town of <LOCATION> Armagh </LOCATION>. The other two defendants _ <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Hogan </PERSON>, 25, of <LOCATION> Dublin </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Gerard </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, 45, of <PERSON> Cork </PERSON> _ come from the <LOCATION> Irish </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>. <PERSON> O'Grady </PERSON>, who did not appear in the court, was abducted at gunpoint from his <LOCATION> Dublin </LOCATION> home. However, his father-in-law, Dr. <PERSON> Austin </PERSON> <PERSON> Darragh </PERSON>, was the intended target. <PERSON> Darragh </PERSON> established an international drugs testing company, the <ORGANIZATION> Dublin-based </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Clinical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pharmacology </ORGANIZATION>. O'Hare was accused of masterminding the kidnapping. Nicknamed the `` Border Fox'' for his activities along the border between the <LOCATION> Irish </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> O'Hare </LOCATION> is a former member of the <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> and its offshoot, the <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>. Both groups have disowned him as a liability in their fight to rid <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> of British rule. O'Hare has spent seven years in prison. He vowed police would never take him alive in a clandestine interview with an Irish newspaper during the kidnapping.

 Foreigners including businessmen, sailors and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops must obtain certificates showing they are free of the AIDS virus before they can stay in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>, the government said today. The order, which takes effect Monday, requires all merchant sailors to present AIDS-free certificates regardless of how long they plan to remain in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>. Other foreigners must prove they are free of the virus if they want to stay longer than six months, the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> said. It added that details of the regulation covering <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops and dependents would be worked out in talks with <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> authorities. Foreigners admitted for less than six months must obtain AIDS-free certificates from government-approved hospitals if they want to extend their stay, the department added. The regulation was issued in compliance with an order by the <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Immigration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deportation </ORGANIZATION> banning foreigners with `` loathsome or dangerous and contagious diseases.'' Immigration officials said the order was issued to prevent the spread of the deadly disease in a country where prostitution is widespread. Some health officials have criticized the plan as ineffective. They say foreigners admitted for short periods could spread AIDS because they would not be required to prove they are free of the disease. They also noted that foreigners could purchase forged certificates. Immigration Commissioner <PERSON> Miriam </PERSON> <PERSON> Defensor-Santiago </PERSON> said she did not include short-term residents or tourists in the order because the move could lead to reprisals against Filipino tourists by other nations. According to the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION>, more than 50 people in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> have been identified as carrying the AIDS virus but most have not shown symptoms of the disease. Most of the infected people have been bar girls working near <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military bases. AIDS, or acquired immune deficiency syndrome, destroys the body's immune system and makes the victim susceptible to cancers and other fatal ailments. There is no cure. The virus is primarily spread by sexual contact, use of contaminated needles, and transfusions of contaminated blood. The disease can be transferred from an infected mother to her unborn child.

 The Academy Awards show seems to have stemmed the extravaganza's television ratings decline by racking up its highest rating in five years, according to preliminary data released today by <ORGANIZATION> A.C. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nielsen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co </ORGANIZATION>. In the 15 largest television markets, Monday night's show had a rating of 37.7 and a 59 share. The rating is a percentage of the nation's 88.6 million homes with television. The share is a percentage of sets in use. The last time the Oscars show rated higher was in 1983, when it got a 38.0 and 59. Last year, the show had a national rating of 27.5 and a 43 share. When <PERSON> Nielsen </PERSON> computes the national rating for the show later today, adding in smaller markets and rural areas, the numbers could drop somewhat. The show lasted from 9 p.m. EDT until 12:30 a.m. But during prime time, from 9-11 p.m., according to the big-city overnights, it had a 38.3 rating and 56 share; <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> had a rating of 6.9 and a 10 share. <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> had a 6.4 and 9.

<TEXT>
 Crude oil prices advanced again this morning after a one-day jump incited by speculation that <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> will orchestrate a broad effort to constrict world supplies, though some analysts called the rise unsustainable. On the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, the May-delivery contract for <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intermediate </ORGANIZATION> crude rose 4 cents per barrel to $ 17.93 early today after closing up $ 1.01 Monday at $ 17.89, the highest close since mid-December. Refined products traded on the exchange were mixed after large advances Monday. Wholesale heating oil fell 0.26 cent a gallon after rising 2.42 cents during the previous session to 47.88 cents. Wholesale unleaded gasoline rose .10 cent a gallon to 51.05 cents after a 2.18-cent rise the previous session. Elsewhere, several major <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> oil companies, reacting to the jump in crude prices, announced 50-cent increases in the price they pay for West Texas Intermediate. Traders attributed the jumps to a weekend meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exporting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Countries </ORGANIZATION>' price-monitoring committee, which stated it would enlist help from non-OPEC producers to restrain output. A one-day surge in crude-oil prices does not necessarily mean higher retail prices later. But if the market sustains the increase, some analysts say, American consumers could be paying an additional 10 to 12 cents a gallon for gasoline by the peak of the summer season. `` This is not a flash in the pan. This is the beginning of a bull move,'' said <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Beutel </PERSON>, assistant director of <ORGANIZATION> Elders </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Futures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> energy futures trading concern. `` The real story is the oil market cycle has turned; it's ready to go higher.'' Others discounted the move as a temporary spike in a market that remains basically unchanged. They attributed it to misinformed speculation about <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION>'s strategy and influence. `` I see the <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> thing as a fairly empty public relations gesture,'' said <PERSON> Carol </PERSON> <PERSON> Epstein </PERSON>, analyst at <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Analysis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> consulting and publishing concern. `` I do n't see any fundamental turning around here.'' Ms. <PERSON> Epstein </PERSON> said her view was based partly on efforts by some <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> members, notably key producer <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>, to move into the refining or `` downstream'' end of the oil business. This suggests <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> itself believes the surplus of crude oil on world markets will persist, which makes refining more attractive. Nevertheless, some analysts said the move by the <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> price monitoring committee was significant because the idea for cooperation was initiated by eight non-OPEC exporters. Emissaries from <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oman </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Brunei </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION>, who met last month, concluded that coordination with <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> could help combat weak prices and excessive supplies. `` There's momentum to have detente between <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> and non-OPEC producers,'' said <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Yergen </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Cambridge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION>, a petroleum market consulting company in <LOCATION> Cambridge </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass </LOCATION>. `` This would be a major shift in that direction. It's bullish for higher prices.'' <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION>'s 13 members produce about 17.5 million barrels daily. Production from the non-OPEC exporters interested in cooperating with <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> totals about 8 million barrels daily. An agreement between them would affect production that accounts for more than half the consumption in the non-communist world. But skepticism persists that <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> could engineer an agreement to restrain production among countries outside its jurisdiction. Some analysts emphasize that <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> has faced difficulty enforcing internal discipline. `` Controlling production with 21 or so players is n't easy,'' said <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, a petroleum analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Bear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stearns </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cos. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` Keeping 13 guys in line is tough enough.'' Others said <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION>'s previously failed efforts to maintain prices had erased much of the once-mighty cartel's credibility, suggesting its move to enlist support from non-OPEC exporters also was doomed. `` My attitude has been, talk is cheap with that crowd,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Dea </PERSON>, manager of international energy futures at <ORGANIZATION> Dean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Witter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reynolds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` I think in the final analysis, they have to produce some viable kind of agreement, and they have n't been able to do it for the past year Why should they do it now?''

 An accused murderer killed himself while being held at a psychiatric institute by driving two ballpoint pens through his heart, a corner's jury has ruled. The jury in suburban <LOCATION> Vancouver </LOCATION> issued its findings Monday after pathologist Dr. <PERSON> Lindsay </PERSON> <PERSON> Sturrock </PERSON> testified on the suicide of <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> <PERSON> Foster </PERSON> ,37, at the <ORGANIZATION> Forensic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Psychiatric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> in </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coquitlam </ORGANIZATION>, another <LOCATION> Vancouver </LOCATION> suburb Foster put the sharp end of a pen against his bare chest and, with the other end propped against a door, leaned forward, forcing the pen between his ribs and into his heart on Dec. 27, <PERSON> Sturrock </PERSON> said. When that failed to kill him, <PERSON> Foster </PERSON> repeated the process with a second pen, again penetrating his heart, and died of massive bleeding into his chest cavity, the pathologist said. When a juror asked how anyone could twice complete such a painful process, the pathologist said, `` If someone is sufficiently disturbed to do away with himself, pain does n't mean very much.'' The jury recommended closer, 24-hour watches on maximum-security patients and changes in the institute's assessment reporting system. Foster had been undergoing a 30-day psychiatric examination after being charged with first-degree murder in the bludgeoning death of his common-law wife, <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> <PERSON> Pilling </PERSON>, 34, her daughter <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Brewer </PERSON> and <PERSON> Brewer </PERSON>'s friend <PERSON> Megan </PERSON> <PERSON> Sue </PERSON> <PERSON> McCleary </PERSON>, both 12. Foster surrendered to police Dec. 13, the day after the three slayings, and was admitted to the institute Dec. 15. <PERSON> Terrance </PERSON> <PERSON> Neil </PERSON>, nursing director at the institute, testified that <PERSON> Foster </PERSON> denied feelings of depression or suicide when he was admitted. Shortly before his suicide, however, <PERSON> Foster </PERSON> wrote a letter to correction officials begging for special protection in prison.

 Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said today `` I ca n't wait'' to take on any of the three Democrats still vying for their party's nomination. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is seeking to build big-state support while acknowledging his campaign lacks the excitement of the Democratic primary contest. `` I still intend to campaign right through the end of the primary season. I ca n't wait to take on which ever one of those three Democrats wins the Democratic nomination,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told a $ 100-a-plate Republican breakfast in <LOCATION> Schenectady </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> planned to throw out the first ball at a Mets baseball game in Shea Stadium in the afternoon. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is spending three days campaigning in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> state </LOCATION>, even though his only Republican opponent on the April 19 primary ballot is former television evangelist <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>, who has ceased active campaigning. `` We do n't have all the excitement that exists on the Democratic side of the aisle, but we have a lot more unity and we have fewer problems,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told a shopping mall audience on Monday in <LOCATION> White </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plains </LOCATION>. During a visit to an <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> center in <LOCATION> Thornwood </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> declined to comment on remarks by <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> suggesting that <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Jews ought not to vote for Democrat <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. `` Listen, I've got enough problems on our own side to get into the Democratic nominating process,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> is entitled to his opinion. Each candidate is entitled to run on his record.'' In fact, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, <PERSON> Jewish </PERSON> voters should vote for him. `` I think everyone should vote for me.

<HEAD>Many Weekend Gang Arrest Cases Dismissed For Lack Of Evidence</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Prosecutors have rejected about half the cases brought so far following a giant weekend police sweep against gangs, saying there is not enough evidence to proceed in court. Two nights of dusk-to-dawn patrols last weekend by about 1,000 officers resulted in 1,453 arrests, Officer <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Mariani </PERSON> said. Charges have been filed so far in 32 of 60 cases taken to the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Attorney </LOCATION>'s office, said Deputy District Attorney <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Kay </PERSON>. The other 28 were rejected because of lack of evidence, he said. City attorney's spokesman <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Qualls </PERSON> said half of the 41 cases taken to his agency were rejected because of insufficient evidence. Felony cases are normally prosecuted by the county, while the city attorney takes misdemeanors. Other cases still must be reviewed. Police Chief <PERSON> Daryl </PERSON> <PERSON> Gates </PERSON> called for the show of force after a rash of gang-related shootings, including a drive-by attack Good Friday that killed one man and wounded a dozen other people. The weekend sweep dubbed `` Fly the Flag'' won praise from most quarters, but three people whose house was allegedly ransacked by police serving a search warrant called the show of force heavy-handed. There were 387 gang-related murders in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> last year and more than 85 such homicides have been reported so far this year. More than half of those arrested, or 794, were alleged gang members, <PERSON> Mariani </PERSON> said. Offenses ranged from 171 arrested for investigation of drug peddling to 138 allegedly driving under the influence of alcohol of drugs, he said. `` We accomplished what we set out to do, namely letting gangs know we mean to put them out of business,'' said police spokeswoman <PERSON> Margie </PERSON> <PERSON> Reed </PERSON>. `` But we are n't saying when we'll hit again. We do n't particularly like to let them know we're coming like we did this time. <PERSON> Gates </PERSON> urged officers to get tough with gang members while showing restraint in dealing with others living in gang-dominated neighborhoods. But two men and a pregnant woman said officers serving a search warrant Sunday ransacked their home, beat them and forced to lie on the floor while handcuffed. `` I was just getting ready to watch the Laker game on TV when I heard them kick in the front door and start breaking windows,'' said O.C. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, 34. `` They strapped a plastic loop on my wrists real tight, made me get down on the foor and kicked me in the ribs.'' The plain-clothes officers put guns to the heads of the three adults and repeatedly swore at them to obey orders, <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said. Police Lt. <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Hepburn </PERSON>, who led the raid, said a previous undercover drug purchase at the house prompted the raid, but no drugs were found. Despite the citywide gang crackdown, four people were killed in drive-by shootings over the weekend, and nine other people were injured in a similar attack in <LOCATION> Willowbrook </LOCATION>, authorities said.

 `` The Last Emperor,'' the lavish epic of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> directed by an Italian, conquered <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> by capturing nine Oscars, the most for any film in 26 years. <PERSON> Cher </PERSON> won best actress for portrayal of a widow who discovers love in `` Moonstruck.'' <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON>, the greedy, unethical inside trader of `` Wall Street,'' was named best actor at Monday night's 60th-annual Academy Awards ceremony. Best supporting performers were <PERSON> Olympia </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, as <PERSON> Cher </PERSON>'s outspoken Italian mother coping with a wayward husband in `` Moonstruck,'' and <PERSON> Sean </PERSON> <PERSON> Connery </PERSON>, the hard-fisted, incorruptible <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> beat cop in `` The Untouchables. <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> paid tribute to his father, actor <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON> <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON>, `` for helping a son move out of the shadow,'' and <PERSON> Cher </PERSON> credited her mother for urging her as a little girl `` to be something.'' `` I do n't think this means that I am somebody,'' <PERSON> Cher </PERSON> told the audience while clutching her statue. `` But I guess I'm on my way. Thank you.'' Backstage, the actress, in a stunning, form-revealing costume of strategically placed spangles, told reporters: `` If I can win this statue I think anybody can do anything!'' In addition to best picture, `` The Last Emperor'' won in every category in which it was nominated, including screenplay adaptation, costumes, original score, art direction, cinematography, sound, editing and the directing award to acclaimed filmmaker <PERSON> Bernardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Bertolucci </PERSON>. `` As an Italian, as a European, the Academy Awards has always seemed to me like a distant ceremony,'' said <PERSON> Bertolucci </PERSON>, `` something fascinating, remote. Something I really did n't belong to. Then, one day, ` The Last Emperor' got nine nominations and everything changed immediately.'' The director, who surprised the industry by winning permission from the Chinese government to film a story with political overtones within <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>'s fabled <LOCATION> Forbidden </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, offered `` a <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> kowtow to the Academy,'' saying, `` This is one of the strongest emotions of my life and I ca n't hide it.'' The movie's nine Oscars marked the biggest haul since `` West Side Story'' took 10 in 1962. The all-time champ, <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Hur </PERSON>, won 11 in 1960. `` Moonstruck'' took three Oscars, but the critically acclaimed `` Hope and Glory'' and crowd-pleasers `` Good Morning, <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'' and `` Broadcast News'' struck out despite having five, one and seven nominations, respectively. The Oscar audience of 6,300 cheered loudly for the supporting actor and actress awards. `` OK, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON>, let's go!'' exclaimed Miss <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> as she held her Oscar aloft. She was referring to her cousin <LOCATION> Massachussets </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, who is seeking the Democratic presidential nomination. She said she would hit the campaign trial if her cousin is nominated, and will seek to be a Democratic delegate from her home state <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>. Backstage, she delivered an acceptance speech in Greek for reporters from the land of her heritage. <PERSON> Connery </PERSON>, the original <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Bond </PERSON>, drew two standing ovations during the evening and addressed his thanks to, `` Ladies and gentlemen, friends, and a few enemies.'' <PERSON> Connery </PERSON> said he assumed his award was for `` an accumulation of my different performances.'' He also made a plea for an end to the 5 -LCB- - week-old <ORGANIZATION> Writers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guild </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> strike that caused some clumsiness in the script for the ceremony, which is normally written by some of <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION>'s best wordsmiths The award for song went to `` The Time of My Life'' from `` Dirty Dancing,'' and the movie's stars, <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Swayze </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jennifer </PERSON> <PERSON> Grey </PERSON>, appeared as presenters. In a ceremony that rewards dramatic expertise, there were many lump-in-the throat moments, among them deaf actress <PERSON> Marlee </PERSON> <PERSON> Matlin </PERSON>'s presentation of the best actor <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> to <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> Miss <PERSON> Matlin </PERSON>, who won last year as best actress, abruptly abandoned her sign language to speak haltingly as she announced the nominees and exclaimed an exuberant, `` Good Morning, Vietnam!'' when she reached <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>' name. There was <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON>'s recollection of his origins as a German immigrant and declaring of his special <PERSON> Irving </PERSON> <PERSON> Thalberg </PERSON> Award: `` This is the most prestigious award you can get outside the Nobel Prize.'' And there was screenwriter <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Shanley </PERSON>, holding his Oscar for `` Moonstruck'' and enthusing, `` I do n't care if we're supposed to be cool. This is incredible! I want to thank everyone who ever punched me or kissed me in my life.'' He concluded, `` I'm sure I'd like to thank a lot of other people. But I'm going home and die now.'' The evening began with an award for visual effects to `` Innerspace,'' a fantasy about a test pilot reduced to microscopic size. After that, perhaps the only surprise was the best foreign language film award, which went to `` Babette's Feast'' from <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION> over the highly favored `` Au Revoir, <ORGANIZATION> Les </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enfants </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Malle </PERSON>'s memoir of his wartime childhood The best animated short film award went to `` The Man Who Planted Trees.'' Best documentary feature was `` The Ten-Year Lunch: The Wit and Wisdom of the Algonquin Roundtable,'' and best documentary short subject was `` Young At Heart.'' Best live action short film was `` Ray's Male Heterosexual Dance Hall,'' and the award for makeup went to `` <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> and the <ORGANIZATION> Hendersons </ORGANIZATION>.'' The relocation of the Oscars to the cavernous Shrine Auditorium caused logistical problems including a monumental traffic jam that forced some stars to leave their limousines and walk rather than miss the ceremonies. Best actress nominees Meryl Streep and <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> <PERSON> Close </PERSON>, who is nine months pregnant, were spotted hiking up the street in their Oscar finery.

<HEAD>Food Packaging Makers Acting to Ease Ozone Threat</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Companies using ozone-destroying chemicals to make plastic foam food packaging will switch to other compounds by the end of the year, their trade association said today. While such use accounts for only 1.5 percent to 2 percent of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> production of the chemicals in question, chlorofluorocarbons or CFCs, some environmentalists have targeted food packages as a highly visible and unessential use of the CFCs. The environmentalists already had won pledges from fast food chains not to use CFC-made products. About one-third of foam packages _ things like egg cartons and clamshell hamburger containers _ are made with CFCs, said <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Bow </PERSON>, president of the trade group, the <ORGANIZATION> Foodservice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Packaging </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, at a news conference. Most of the rest are manufactured with other compounds such as pentane, but the CFCs in question are expected to be replaced by the 15 companies using them with a related compound called HCFC-22. The program is voluntary on the part of the companies, but <PERSON> Bow </PERSON> said none was expected to refuse to participate. The replacement compound has only about 5 percent of the ozone-destroying potential of the CFCs it replaces. <PERSON> Jeffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Eves </PERSON>, a vice president of the <ORGANIZATION> Fort </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Howard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, the largest user of CFCs in making food packages, said the cost of using the replacement would be about even with the old compounds. Three major environmental groups, Friends of the <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>, the Environmental Defense Fund and the <ORGANIZATION> Natural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, praised the action and said they would join the institute in monitoring HCFC-22 use and seeking an entirely benign replacement. They also will use the action in pressuring companies with other <ORGANIZATION> CFC </ORGANIZATION> uses to find alternatives, said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Doniger </PERSON>, an attorney for the <ORGANIZATION> Natural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>. `` It does n't solve all the problems posed by plastic packaging. Plastic packaging still poses a trash problem. Nevertheless, the industry deserves support,'' said <PERSON> Doniger </PERSON>. Ozone at high altitudes protects the earth from the sun's cancer-causing ultraviolet rays, but can be destroyed by chlorine liberated from the breakup of <ORGANIZATION> CFC </ORGANIZATION> compounds at those altitudes HCFC-22 breaks up much lower down in the atmosphere. Last month the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> reported that CFCs appear to have been responsible for an average 2.3 percent decline in the ozone shield at northern hemisphere mid-latitudes from 1969 to 1986. A treaty signed by 31 nations last fall requires a 50 percent cut in <ORGANIZATION> CFC </ORGANIZATION> production by 1998.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Utah </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> has protested a plan to build a laboratory at Dugway Proving Ground that would be capable of testing bacteria and viruses for which there are no known cures or vaccines. The department also said Monday that the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>'s draft environmental study on the biological test facility `` has serious deficiencies.'' Gov. <PERSON> Norm </PERSON> <PERSON> Bangerter </PERSON> and some members of <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>'s congressional delegation also oppose the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>'s proposed $ 5.4 million biological aerosol test facility. The lab would have the highest level of containment possible, known as `` biosafety level 4.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> said it does not plan to conduct tests requiring BL4 containment, but it has not ruled out such tests in the future. Dr. <PERSON> Suzanne </PERSON> <PERSON> Dandoy </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, said the draft environmental study `` is totally inadequate in justifying the need or addressing the impacts of a biological level-four facility. `` We are opposed to the construction of a BL4 facility because there is no justification of need nor information that demonstrates that the public could be protected,'' <PERSON> Dandoy </PERSON> said in a letter Monday to Dugway's commander, Col. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Tipton </PERSON>. <PERSON> Dandoy </PERSON> recommended that a citizen advisory board of state and national experts be created to evaluate the need for and potential risks associated with a BL4 facility. <PERSON> Dandoy </PERSON> also recommended the state be granted full oversight of research at Dugway. `` Specifically, the <ORGANIZATION> Utah </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> should be apprised of all microorganisms being tested, and should be notified immediately of any accidental pathogen or toxin exposures or releases,'' the department said. The department contends it is possible a worker `` could be unknowingly contaminated with a pathogen, spreading this in the community before the contagion is recognized.''

 Missing newlyweds toyed with the idea of secretly selling her expensive foreign car and running away to another country, possibly <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>, according to an entry in the woman's journal But friends and family of <ORGANIZATION> Wheaton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> students <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Swanson </PERSON>, 23, and <PERSON> Carolyn </PERSON> <PERSON> MacLean </PERSON>, 21, were not taking the entry seriously on Monday. The couple, secretly married March 26, were last seen April 2 when they left Ms. <PERSON> MacLean </PERSON>'s grandmother's house in <LOCATION> Flint </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>, on their way back to <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>. The two were supposed to have dinner in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> before visiting <PERSON> Swanson </PERSON>'s parents in <LOCATION> Elgin </LOCATION>, but they never showed up. Ms. <PERSON> MacLean </PERSON>'s red <ORGANIZATION> BMW </ORGANIZATION> was found April 2 in an alley behind <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>'s Orchestra Hall The key was in the ignition and the engine was running, police said. The journal entry mentioning selling the car and going away was undated. It did not mention <PERSON> Swanson </PERSON> by name but used the pronoun `` we,'' police said. They declined to disclose the exact wording of the entry. But police said that if the pair did indeed flee in search of a new life, they left behind <PERSON> Swanson </PERSON>'s passport, both their driver's licenses and credit cards `` We're looking for a break,'' said Cmdr. <PERSON> Ettore </PERSON> <PERSON> DiVito </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> Police Youth Division. `` We're being very open-minded.'' <PERSON> Gwendy </PERSON> <PERSON> Kem </PERSON>, Ms. <PERSON> MacLean </PERSON>'s best friend, said the title to the car is in her father's name, making a secret sale difficult. `` The fact remains that they were not organized for -LRB- running away -RRB-,'' she said. Over the weekend and again Monday, searchers used a special airplane equipped with infrared sensors to detect freshly buried corpses, but they failed to turn up a trace of the newlyweds. `` While we hope the couple has n't met with foul play, this is something we have to do,'' state police spokesman <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Fletcher </PERSON> said. <PERSON> DiVito </PERSON> said law enforcement personnel from <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> are cooperating in the search.

 <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> offered to storm the hijacked <LOCATION> Kuwaiti </LOCATION> jetliner after it was forced to land in northeastern <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> but <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> rejected the offer, Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister <PERSON> Javad </PERSON> <PERSON> Larijani </PERSON> said today. <PERSON> Larijani </PERSON>, speaking at a news conference at the <ORGANIZATION> Iranian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION>, said <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> had no alternative but to refuel the aircraft and allow it to leave <LOCATION> Mashhad </LOCATION> on Friday. It later landed at <LOCATION> Larnaca </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>. He said the <LOCATION> Kuwaiti </LOCATION> authorities rejected the Iranian offer to storm the <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 747 `` saying they are not going to take responsibility for the outcome of that operation.'' Asked what advice <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> gave, he said, `` I should say, nothing. And we were afraid that the airplane would be blown up so we were forced to refuel it. It was against our wish. But this was the only thing we could do.'' He said the hijacked aircraft would not be allowed back to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. `` We think it's for the people in <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION> to decide,'' <PERSON> Larijani </PERSON> said. `` <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> will be closed to all hijacked airplanes forever.'' He denied news reports that additional hijackers were allowed to board the plane in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. `` Hijacking innocent people is wrong,'' he said. `` These people should be released immediately. This is not a noble deed for a noble cause at all.'' The hijackers, who commandeered the <ORGANIZATION> Kuwait </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> plane April 5 on a flight from <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>, have demanded that <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> free 17 convicted terrorists. The plane carried 112 people when it left <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION>. Fifty-seven people were freed in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, and one man was released after the plane reached <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>. The hijackers have killed two passengers.

 Fourteen-month-old Siamese twin girls who were joined from the waist down have been separated in a 12-hour operation, Children's Hospital of <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> announced today. Both girls were in critical but stable condition, which was considered normal after such an operation, said hospital spokeswoman <PERSON> Laura </PERSON> <PERSON> Feragen </PERSON>. The operation was performed Monday. The family requested that the girls' names and home town not be released, the spokeswoman said. The twins were joined front to front, said <PERSON> Bonnie </PERSON> <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON>, another hospital spokeswoman. Each girl had one leg and they shared a third, fused leg, she said. The type of joining affects only about 1 percent of all Siamese twins, Ms. <PERSON> Feragen </PERSON> said. However, it was the fourth such incidence treated at <LOCATION> Children </LOCATION><LOCATION> 's </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>, she said. Since December the twins had been undergoing a series of skin-expanding procedures using balloon-like silicon implants into which saline solution was pumped, Ms. <PERSON> Feragen </PERSON> said.

 A reporter for The <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> Inquirer whose Pulitzer Prize was challenged by a magazine that ran a similar story says he had no doubt his award would be upheld. The Pulitzer board's executive committee said Monday it saw no reason to question the award to <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> Weiner </PERSON>, who won the national reporting prize for a 1987 series on the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s `` black budget'' for secret projects The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION> last week asked the board to reconsider the Inquirer's prize. The Washington-based weekly magazine said <PERSON> Weiner </PERSON>'s series was `` a blatant and egregious case of building a news story according to someone else's blueprint,'' namely, the magazine's March 1, 1986, cover story about the black budget. It contended that <PERSON> Weiner </PERSON>'s story broke no new ground. In <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> on Monday, <PERSON> Weiner </PERSON> called the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION>'s challenge `` a false charge and a phony controversy. `` I never had any doubts it would be resolved this way,'' he said. `` It's been very instructive being on the other end of the telescope.'' The committee's decision shows its members are `` able to cut through baloney when they see it,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Naughton </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Inquirer </ORGANIZATION>'s deputy managing editor. `` We appreciate the promptness with which the Pulitzer board acted on our request for a review,'' <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION> publisher <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Fox </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> said in a statement. `` We raised the issue of recycled journalism in good faith and now consider the current matter closed.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Pulitzer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> said in a statement that after careful consideration of the Journal's objections, the executive committee found no reason to question the award. Three committee members met in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> on Monday and two joined in on the phone from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, said board secretary <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON>. `` It was relatively brief and there was n't any disagreement,'' <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> said. `` Everybody was in accord on what should be done or should not be done.'' The statement said the decision was reached by unanimous vote of the five executive committee members participating, he said. Two members, <ORGANIZATION> Inquirer </ORGANIZATION> executive editor <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> and <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Laventhol </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mirror </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, which owns the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION>, did not take part. Those taking part included <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON>; <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilkins </PERSON>, senior fellow at the Washington-based <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Policy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studies </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoge </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, publisher of the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Charlotte </PERSON> <PERSON> Saikowski </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> bureau chief of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monitor </ORGANIZATION>; and <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sovern </PERSON>. <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> said last week that prize-winning stories do n't have to break new ground, but only represent `` a distinguished example of reporting on national affairs.'' `` Our object was to publish the most complete, thorough, readable account of the black budget ever done, and we are convinced we did it,'' said <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON>. The Inquirer said <PERSON> Weiner </PERSON> broke new ground with his analysis of the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> budget, concluding that the department had $ 35 billion in hidden programs. <PERSON> Weiner </PERSON> said he interviewed more than 100 people across the nation and was `` knee-deep'' in his work before he saw the Journal's story.

 Democrats <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> tangled in a sometimes contentious debate in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> today, while rival <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> declared he was no longer the underdog but `` one of the top dogs, and I just love it.'' <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> engaged in exchanges over the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, welfare and their own presidential race _ and the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor upbraided the <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> senator for attacking him as too soft on <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, the front-runner, said he would compete for delegates won by other candidates who have left the race and even `` maybe for <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>'s delegates.'' `` Do n't lick your chops too soon, Governor <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> shot back. `` <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s going to have a bigger say about that than you will.'' The debate came one week before the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> primary, with 255 delegates at stake, and was the first full-scale <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> debate since last month's Super Tuesday campaign. Elsewhere in the Empire State, Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told a $ 100-a-plate Republican breakfast in <LOCATION> Schenectady </LOCATION> today that despite his virtual lock on the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> nomination, `` I still intend to campaign right through the end of the primary season.'' `` I ca n't wait to take on whichever one of those three Democrats wins the Democratic nomination,'' he said. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>, in the 90-minute Democratic debate, claimed for himself the role of underdog, a position supported by his standing in the polls. But <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, whose candidacy has moved from a symbolic one four years ago to a contending one this year, said <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> does n't necessarily favor the underdog `` I was an underdog for 45 years and 11 months, and now I'm one of the top dogs, and I just love it,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said. `` <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> loves a winner, and I'm a winner.'' The Democrats' debate reflected the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> primary's focus on <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> issues. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> cited disagreements with both <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> on the issue of an independent state for Palestinians, saying <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> had sounded a note of `` enthusiasm'' about such a prospect. He said he disagreed `` with the way <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> advocates a Palestinian state.'' <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>, trailing far behind his two rivals in polls in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, also said that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor, recently recommended `` very, very deep cuts'' in aid to welfare recipients and poor families as part of his new budget for <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>.'' `` That's absolutely incorrect,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> shot back. `` You're wrong You're wrong.'' The candidates met in an 90-minute debate in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s Felt Forum, the event sponsored by the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, who has drawn opposition from some Jewish leaders, said mutual recognition and security were goals in the occupied territories in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>. `` While we can guarantee secure borders, we can not ensure tranquility so long as there is occupation,'' he said. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>, calling the issue `` politically charged,'' then said he had disagreements with <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said, `` I think we can disagree without suggesting anyone is attacking anyone. And <PERSON> Al </PERSON>, I think I heard you correctly when you were attacking me for not attacking <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON>. That's the first time that's happened in 25 years.'' <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> responded, `` What I said was you were timid in not being willing to say why you believed you would make a better president than <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> shot back, `` No, you said I was timid because I would not attack this man. First time that's happend.'' `` I did n't express enthusiasm for a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> state yesterday,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> added. `` I expressed enthusiasm for presidential leadership to persuade <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> leaders to finally stand up and say they were prepared to commit themsevlves'' to saying <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> has a right to exist. Monday night, a little Hollywood glitter rubbed off <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' campaign, as his cousin picked up an Academy Award `` OK, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON>, let's go!'' <PERSON> Olympia </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> called as she accepted her Oscar for best supporting actress for her performance in the comedy `` Moonstruck.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, at a restaurant in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> that figured in the film, called his cousin to congratulate her, and said her triumph `` may be a sign of good things to come in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, touring an <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> plant in <LOCATION> Thornwood </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, on Monday, called himself `` a good friend of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'' and said <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> Jews should vote for him and not a Democrat. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, speaking to Jewish leaders, said <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> leaders are responsible for the violence in the Israeli-occupied territories. He said neither the young stone-throwers nor the Israeli government bear the blame. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, in a delicate position because he made comments in 1984 that offended many Jews, continued to put distance between himself and <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>, with whom he once met. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> called the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> leader one of the `` most extreme elements'' in the conflict, and urged Jewish and Arab-Americans to hold talks themselves in an effort to find common ground. His comment about <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> drew the ire of some Arab-Americans. <PERSON> Abdeen </PERSON> <PERSON> Jabara </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> American-Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Anti-Discrimination </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, sent a letter to <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, complaining, `` Your comments in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> have the appearance of tailoring your positions on critical issues to suit the narrow political views of powerful special interests.'' <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>, on Monday, continued to stress his support for <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, adding it would be possible to test some sort of limited autonomy for <LOCATION> Palestinians </LOCATION> on the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>. But he said any such formula would have to include assurances of security for <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> has been lagging behind <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> in polls of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> voters as well as the national delegate count. The latest <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> count puts <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> at 745.05, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> at 709.55, <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> at 395.8 and uncommitted 514.35.

<HEAD>100 Still Missing After Pakistani Explosion</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 About 100 people were still missing today, two days after an explosion at an ammunition depot killed 93 people and injured 1,100. State-run <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> television said 170 teams of explosives experts, working around the clock, have so far cleared 20,000 missiles, grenades and other weapons that lay around the twin cities of <LOCATION> Islamabad </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Rawalpindi </LOCATION>. President <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> <PERSON> ul-Haq </PERSON> said Monday that an estimated 6,500 devices were to be cleared. There was no explanation for the discrepancy in the figures. The <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> reported today that agents from the pro-Soviet government in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> were apparently responsible for Sunday's explosion. The newspaper, quoting unidentified sources, said Pakistani military experts had told <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials about the cause of the blast. The explosion was caused by three incendiary devices carried to the ammunition dump by trucks bearing Afghan license plates and equipped with time fuses, the Times said. They were exploded in sequence, the newspaper said.

About 100 people remained unaccounted for, it said. The Cabinet chaired by Prime Minister <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Khan </PERSON> <PERSON> Junejo </PERSON> and the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> met today to review the situation. Pakistani television said that during the Cabinet meeting, it was decided that a committee investigating the explosion should submit its findings with recommendations within 10 days and that they will be made public.

 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s wealthy friends who are buying a <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> estate for him to occupy probably could give it to him without violating conflict-of-interest laws, according to the Office of Government Ethics. The opinion confirms that industrialists <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON> <PERSON> Tuttle </PERSON> and <PERSON> Earle </PERSON> <PERSON> Jorgensen </PERSON> are among the 20 or so businessmen who purchased a $ 2.5 million home for the <ORGANIZATION> Reagans </ORGANIZATION> to live in when they leave the White House next year. The July 31, 1986, letter was written in response to a request from private attorneys who wanted to determine whether the arrangement would be ethically appropriate. It was made available to The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> today by a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> law firm. The Reagans began paying rent under a three-year lease which took effect March 1 with an option to buy the house eventually. The White House says <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and his wife <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> will pay fair-market rent for the property. The opinion letter notes that criminal conflict-of-interest laws do n't apply to the president. It says standards of conduct for the executive office of the president restrict an employee's acceptance of any gift from a person who is doing business with the employee's agency. However, the letter notes that an employee may accept a gift from a friend, when the circumstances make it clear that the personal relationship is the motivating factor. `` If your proposal was viewed as a favor or as something of monetary value, there would be an exception that would permit the president to accept it,'' said the letter by <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>, the ethics office's former director. The letter was requested by <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> lawyers representing <ORGANIZATION> Wall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, the company in which the <ORGANIZATION> Reagans </ORGANIZATION>' friends bought stock in order to raise the capital to buy the home for the <ORGANIZATION> Reagans </ORGANIZATION> in 1986. In a July 21, 1986, request to the ethics office marked `` confidential,'' the lawyers for <ORGANIZATION> Wall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> said that a group of about 18 financially independent friends of the <ORGANIZATION> Reagans </ORGANIZATION> proposed to buy and renovate the Bel Air home. In an interview Monday night, <ORGANIZATION> Wall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION>'s chief financial officer, <ORGANIZATION> Ira </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revich </ORGANIZATION>, said `` approximately 20'' friends of the <ORGANIZATION> Reagans </ORGANIZATION> had bought stock in the company. The 1986 request did n't identify the businessmen and <PERSON> Revich </PERSON> refused to name them. Under <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> law, companies incorporated in that state do n't have to identify stockholders. <PERSON> Tuttle </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jorgensen </PERSON> are listed as directors and the 1986 request to the ethics office describes their business activities and says they are stockholders. The `` confidential'' request says that at least one of the investors had loaned money to the president's inaugural committee and that about six had given the president or the first lady gifts in the previous six years. A number of the investors had served as informal, non-government advisers to the president. But he has appointed some of them, or their spouses or relatives, to various commissions or federal posts, said the request. In an interview, <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> said he recalled that the ethics office had gotten the names of the investors after requesting them and that the office `` went through the whole conflicts of interest'' analysis. The house is in the Bel Air section of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, about 12 miles northwest of downtown <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> and near the University of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. It has three bedrooms and six bathrooms, a formal living room, a family room, a sun room, a butler's pantry and three servant's rooms. Among the neighbors are <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>, <PERSON> Zsa </PERSON> <PERSON> Zsa </PERSON> <PERSON> Gabor </PERSON>, <PERSON> Mac </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Burt </PERSON> <PERSON> Bacharach </PERSON>.

 Grateful black residents who won a court battle against the government offered their white lawyer a bride, but he politely declined. `` I am very pleased to say that I already have a wife,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Dugard </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Applied </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Legal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studies </ORGANIZATION> at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Witswatersrand </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION>.

The government's 10 homelands are part of a plan to grant limited autonomy to the country's blacks. They are not internationally recognized, however. A court ruled March 29 that President P.W. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> exceeded his powers when he incorporated <PERSON> Moutse </PERSON> into the <LOCATION> KwaNdebele </LOCATION> homeland. The community is independent of any homeland as a result of the decision. Most Moutse residents belong to the North Sotho tribe.

 Police arrested 12 men Tuesday and accused them of gang-raping a 21-year-old women in this Sicilian hamlet. Three other men were sought in the case. The victim was invited to a party April 4 by a group of people she considered new friends. Instead, 11 men beat and raped her in a cottage, police said. On her way back to town, she was stopped by a car with four other men. Offering her a ride, they took her back into the countryside and raped her a second time, police said. Authorities jailed seven young men Tuesday and released five others under 18 on their own recognizance.

<HEAD>Federal Judge Issues Ban On Strychnine As Rodent Bait</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Farmers and ranchers can not use strychnine above ground to control rodents and other pests if the poison would threaten protected wildlife, a federal judge has ruled. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Diana </PERSON> <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> said Monday the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> violated federal law in registering strychnine for above-ground pest control. The ruling affects 62 species and subspecies of animals that are protected under federal law, including grizzly bears, salt marsh harvest mice, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> geese, wolves, owls, hawks, <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> condors and bald and golden eagles. `` It is the most broad-ranging opinion ever issued under the Endangered Species Act, both in the number of different animals it protects and the fact that it protects them almost across the entire <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Neill </PERSON>, a lawyer for three environmental groups that filed suit. <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> said federal regulations require strychnine-laced baits be set so that only targeted animals are likly to eat the poison. However, she noted, `` Strychnine is non-selective. It kills anything which ingests a lethal dose. Mortality can occur to both ` target' and ` non-target' species.'' Up to 500,000 pounds of strychnine-laced bait is used annually to kill pests such as prairie dogs, ground squirrels, meadow mice and nuisance birds that eat farm crops, according to court documents. The poison is used mainly in the West, but also in some Eastern states. <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> said her injunction will remain in effect indefinitely unless the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> can demonstrate how it might allow use of the poison and still prevent the incidental deaths of protected wildlife. <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> violated the Endangered Species Act, the Migratory Bird Treaty Act and the Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act in registering strychnine. The decision did not specify geographical limits for the ban, but said the poison can not be used anywhere it would threaten an protected wildlife. Some protected species, such as <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> geese, cover wide areas in their annual migrations. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Shochey </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> lawyer who represented the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> in the case, said Monday that he had not seen <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON>'s decision and could not comment. The lawsuit was filed against the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> in August 1986 by the <ORGANIZATION> Sierra </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>, Defenders of Wildlife, and Friends of Animals and Their Environment. The <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farm </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION>, which represents more than 3 million farmers and ranchers, joined the case in support of the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION>. The environmentalists said that at least 24 states reported posioning of protected wildlife that had either eaten strychnine-laced bait or the remains of other animals exposed to the bait. Documents given <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> showed five condors, six peregrine falcons, 15 golden eagles, 31 bald eagles and 724 other birds and mammals had died after eating the bait. In <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>, there were documented reports of deaths from strychnine poisoning from 1978 to 1983 involving mallard ducks, snowy owls, a redtailed hawk, a gyrfalcon and a bald eagle, the environmental groups said.

 Wherever Greek-Americans have settled across the land, they have settled on <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, son of <LOCATION> Greek </LOCATION> immigrants, as their presidential candidate. `` I think it's wonderful a Greek has come up this far,'' said <PERSON> Alexandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Matheos </PERSON>, a 62-year-old retired luncheonette owner, as she stood inside St. Basil's after an Easter service. `` It means a lot to all ethnics. When we were kids we never thought we'd live to see a Greek nominated.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' candidacy for the Democratic presidential nomination has caused a surge of excitement among those who came to <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION>, like <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' parents, and among their first-generation children. About 25 percent of the $ 15 million <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has raised in campaign contributions came from the <PERSON> Greek-American </PERSON> community, believed to number about 1 million. `` A lot about the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> candidacy stimulates Greek-Americans,'' says <PERSON> Elias </PERSON> <PERSON> Vlanton </PERSON>, information director of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hellenic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Educational </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Progressive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. `` He invokes his Greek heritage and the values that Greeks hold dear _ love of family, the need and importance of public service.'' Among the people of Greek origin in <LOCATION> Troy </LOCATION>, a melting pot city of 56,000 overlooking the <LOCATION> Hudson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, famous for its hot dogs and as the place where collars for Arrow shirts were once made, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> looms as large as the local legend, <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>. <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, buried in Troy Cemetery, was a meatpacker and patriot who supplied American troops during the War of 1812 with barrels of beef stamped with the letters `` <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION>'' to identify them as property of the government. He became known as `` Uncle <PERSON> Sam </PERSON>,'' namesake of the patriotic symbol. Leaving St. Basil's the other day, <PERSON> Roula </PERSON> <PERSON> Aletrakis </PERSON>, 53-year-old native of <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION>, was taken aback at the suggestion that she might vote for anyone other than <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. `` Sure, yes, we're <LOCATION> Greek </LOCATION> people,'' she said when a visitor asked if she was voting for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. `` I've always voted Republican, but this time I'm voting Democrat,'' said her husband, <PERSON> Tony </PERSON>, 66, a retired woodworker. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s primary on Tuesday, <PERSON> Greek-American </PERSON> voters are rallying to <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> just as they have in earlier primary states. Even Greek-Americans who are Republican assume that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> will be the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> candidate and are ready to bolt the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> for their kinsman in November. `` I'm Republican,'' said <PERSON> Nick </PERSON> <PERSON> Zembekis </PERSON>, 50, a Greek native who works at <ORGANIZATION> Chris-Craft </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industrial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Products </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` Sure I'm voting for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> because I'm Greek, that's why. That's all. If I'm not Greek I do n't vote for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>.'' Sitting on a stool next to <PERSON> Zembekis </PERSON> in the Famous Lunch, his friend, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Oureilidis </PERSON>, a 40-year-old bowling equipment supplier, backed him up. `` <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> all the way,'' said <PERSON> Oureilidis </PERSON>. `` I believe the things he says, plus he's Greek. He talks sense. Nobody talks about poor people like he does. I believe he can do it. He's our boy so we have to vote for him.'' Occasionally, there is a dissenter like <PERSON> Nikolaos </PERSON> <PERSON> Adamou </PERSON>, 37, a native of <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> and an economics teacher at <ORGANIZATION> Rensselaer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Polytechnic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, who is a supporter of <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. `` <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> is going to protect <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> interests more effectively in Third World countries,'' he said. `` I like <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. He's Greek. Nothing personally.'' Just the same, there is an outpouring of pride in <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, especialy among older Greek-Americans. `` I think they've been very supportive and very important to the campaign,'' says <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Brountas </PERSON>, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' national campaign chairman and a Greek-American himself whose ties to the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor go back to their college days. `` The thing you have to remember is that in the early stages of his campaign there were two principal sources of contributions. One was a very strong base of support in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>. The second point was the <LOCATION> Greek </LOCATION> support.'' The Rev. <PERSON> Emmanuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Mantzouris </PERSON>, pastor of St. Basil's, which has about 250 Greek-Americans in its congregation, said, `` I think a lot of Greeks are very politically oriented. Just knowing he's Greek draws their attention, somebody being Greek in the limelight.

<HEAD>National Merit Test Program Unfair to Girls, Group Says</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Girls are not getting their fair share of <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Merit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Scholarships </ORGANIZATION> and would win more of the awards if high school grades as well as test scores were counted, a group critical of standardized tests said Tuesday. Boys generally outscore girls on the qualifying test to become National Merit semifinalists, just as they do on the Scholastic Aptitude Test and other standardized exams. But <LOCATION> FairTest </LOCATION>, a group also known as the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fair </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Open Testing, said girls perform better in class than boys. It said high school grades should count just as much as the test scores when the 15,000 National Merit semifinalists are chosen each year. The sponsor, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Merit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Scholarship </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, said that would drive up the cost of administering the prestigious award program and reduce the amount available for scholarships. <PERSON> Sarah </PERSON> <PERSON> Stockwell </PERSON> of <LOCATION> FairTest </LOCATION> called the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Merit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Scholarship </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s reliance on the Preliminary Scholastic Aptitude Test to select semifinalists `` extraordinarily irresponsible'' and said it costs women `` millions of dollars each year.'' <PERSON> Marianne </PERSON> <PERSON> Roderick </PERSON>, a senior vice president of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Merit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Scholarship </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Evanston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, said 63 percent of this year's National Merit semifinalists are boys `` It has been true over a number of years that boys outnumber girls by about 60-40, sometimes a little more, sometimes a little less,'' she said. She defended the use of the standardized test to select semifinalists. `` The merit program is open to more than a million youngsters who enter it each year and we have no quotas regarding boys or girls or ethnic origin or anything else.'' Using the test `` is the best method we have found to date to make entry to the program available ... at a relatively nominal fee,'' she said, adding that switching to some other method of selection would drive up administrative costs. Once the 15,000 semifinalists are chosen, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Merit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Scholarship </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> does look at their high school grades, extracurricular activities and achievements in whittling the field down to 6,000 winners who receive scholarships ranging from $ 250 to $ 8,000. Last year, among the 6,146 who got scholarships, 62 percent were boys and 38 percent were girls, <PERSON> Roderick </PERSON> said. The activist group said it also suspects that minorities are underrepresented among the ranks of the National Merit winners, despite special awards earmarked for black students. The organization sponsors a separate National Achievement Scholarship Program for Outstanding Negro Students that awards about 700 scholarships annually, but <PERSON> Roderick </PERSON> said it does not collect ethnic data from other contestants. Many colleges vie in recruiting National Merit winners and some fund their own scholarships through the National Merit program. Corporations and the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Merit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Scholarship </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> itself provide the other scholarships. The Preliminary Scholastic Aptitude Test, also called the National Merit Scholarship Qualifying Test, is essentially the same as the Scholastic Aptitude Test, although it is scored on a different scale. In selecting semifinalists, the verbal score counts twice as much as the math score. The overall qualifying score varies from state to state; one-half of one percent of each state's graduating seniors are chosen. Last year, when the national average for the Class of 1987 was 906, boys averaged 935 and girls 878. The <LOCATION> Cambridge </LOCATION>, Mass.-based <LOCATION> FairTest </LOCATION> said the tests' multiple choice format seems to favor boys because research suggests they are more adept at guessing, and male characters are featured more often in test questions than females, making the questions more `` male-oriented.'' <LOCATION> FairTest </LOCATION> also said SAT scores underpredict women's actual grades in college. <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Moreno </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, which sponsors the <ORGANIZATION> PSAT </ORGANIZATION> and SAT, said that charge is based on a <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> research report which found women did `` a little bit better in college'' than predicted by their combined SATs and grades. `` But the difference is very, very small,'' said <PERSON> Moreno </PERSON>. The actual grades of the women studied were four-hundredths of one point higher than predicted, he said. `` There's no proof that the test is biased.''

<HEAD>Fragment of Gold Bracelet Linked to Ramses' Favorite Wife</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CAIRO, Egypt (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Workmen cleaning the dusty tomb of <ORGANIZATION> Ramses </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> II </ORGANIZATION>'s beautiful Queen <PERSON> Nefertari </PERSON> found a fragment of beaten gold jewelry that grave robbers and tourists apparently overlooked for 3,250 years. Resins clinging to the etched fragment indicate it may have been attached originally to her missing mummy, Egyptian and <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> officials said Tuesday in announcing the find. If the fragment is determined to have belonged to the queen, it would be rare indeed. The only other surviving legacy of <PERSON> Nefertari </PERSON> is the lid of her sarcophagus, on exhibit at the <LOCATION> Turin </LOCATION> Egyptian Museum in <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>. Egyptian Culture Minister <PERSON> Farouk </PERSON> <PERSON> Hosni </PERSON> called the jewelry, which is 1 -LCB- inches long and an inch wide, `` a significant discovery _ only the second object ever found that probably belonged to <PERSON> Nefertari </PERSON>.'' The piece resembles segments of armlets or bracelets surviving from <PERSON> Ramses </PERSON>' New Kingdom era, with golden pieces linked by chains and beads and decorated with flowers. The fragile gold sheet was in an anteroom behind the queen's burial chamber, found during a project to stop the decay of <PERSON> Nefertari </PERSON>'s tomb in southern <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>'s Valley of the Queens Sponsored by the <ORGANIZATION> Egyptian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Antiquities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Getty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conservation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Marina </LOCATION> <LOCATION> del </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rey </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, the project began 18 months ago and is expected to last another 3 -LCB- years. With its splendid vividly colored wall paintings, <PERSON> Nefertari </PERSON>'s is the greatest among 80 tombs in shallow valleys called `` the place of beauty.'' Royal wives and children were buried there in rock-cut tombs opposite the ancient capital <LOCATION> Thebes </LOCATION>, now called <LOCATION> Luxor </LOCATION>, 450 miles south of <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Monreal </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Getty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>'s director, said nobody believed anything of significance had escaped the attention of grave robbers or the thousands of tourists and conservators who visited the tomb since its discovery in 1904. Workmen inching across the floor of the tomb's final chamber, clearing away the centuries of dust by hand, found the fragment on Feb. 8, <PERSON> Monreal </PERSON> said. It lay `` covered by dust, then by broken bits of wall paintings which in themselves were covered by layers of dust,'' he said. `` Another real bonus that we had n't expected is that we recovered pieces of a complete segment -LRB- of wall painting -RRB-, which will cover some 10 square feet when we reattach it to the rear wall,'' he said. Although proof has n't been found that the fragment was <PERSON> Nefertari </PERSON>'s, there are indications, including its hieroglyphic inscriptions, <PERSON> Monreal </PERSON> said. Los Angeles-based British Egyptologist <PERSON> Helen </PERSON> <PERSON> Strudwick </PERSON>, who studied the piece for <PERSON> Getty </PERSON>, found significance in the ritual inscription `` true of voice,'' a phrase ancient Egyptians normally used after the name of the person who died. She noted that the phrase had a feminine ending. That, plus the fragment's discovery inside <PERSON> Nefertari </PERSON>'s tomb, `` highly suggests'' that it was from the queen's burial paraphernalia, perhaps even torn from her mummified body. `` The piece does not rank with the Tutankhamun treasure in esthetic terms, but it still has historical and sentimental value because the powerful <PERSON> Nefertari </PERSON> simply vanished,'' <PERSON> Monreal </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Nefertari </PERSON>, the beautiful and bold wife of warrior-hero <PERSON> Ramses </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON>, is thought to have died about age 45 about 3,250 years ago. Her tomb paintings and inscriptions depict her as a woman of great charm and exquisite taste, adorned with magnificent jewelry and wearing fashionable gowns. <PERSON> Ramses </PERSON>' favorite of 13 wives, <PERSON> Nefertari </PERSON> accompanied her husband in battle and helped negotiate the world's first peace treaty, <PERSON> Ramses </PERSON>' agreement with the troublesome Hittites of <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> Minor. In her famous temple at <LOCATION> Abu </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Simbel </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Nefertari </PERSON> is pictured begging <PERSON> Ramses </PERSON> to be gentle with his captives. `` <PERSON> Nefertari </PERSON> was the world's first first lady,'' <PERSON> Monreal </PERSON> said. `` She was last seen accompanying her husband to consecrate the two temples at <LOCATION> Abu </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Simbel </LOCATION> in 1255 B.C. Then we know nothing of her. Maybe this piece will tell us about her death.''

 A Marine on security patrol in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> has been killed, apparently by gunfire from a fellow <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION>, a spokesman at the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION> said today. The Marine, a corporal, was a member of I Company, 3rd Battalion, 4th <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regiment </ORGANIZATION>, which is based here and was sent to riot-torn <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> last week, said <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> Col. <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Sconyers </PERSON>. The name of the slain Marine has not been released pending notification of his family. He was shot at least once in the stomach and was pronounced dead at 1:10 a.m. today at <LOCATION> Gorgas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. Attempts to revive the Marine with open-heart massage were unsuccessful. Several major arteries were hit by the bullet and the Marine suffered massive internal bleeding, <PERSON> Sconyers </PERSON> said. The slain man was part of a 12-Marine security patrol at an underground tank facility near <LOCATION> Rodman </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Naval </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Station </LOCATION> on the western side of the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION>. The Marine patrol was split into sections of nine and three Marines when a trip flare was set off, apparently by an intruder, the spokesman said. `` Instead of the flare going up, there was a loud crack, like gunfire. Someone starting shooting,'' <PERSON> Sconyers </PERSON> said. No intruders were apprehended. `` In the confusion of the firing, the intruders all escaped,'' he said. `` Friendly fire from Marines was the only fire we had in the area,'' he said. Circumstances of the shooting are under investigation, said Maj. <PERSON> Stuart </PERSON> <PERSON> Wagner </PERSON>, director of <LOCATION> Camp </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lejeune </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>.

 A former <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION> scientist testified today that he knew of fraud taking place in research at the institute but was reluctant to report it because he feared retribution. Dr. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Maplethorpe </PERSON>, who was conducting post-doctoral research at <ORGANIZATION> MIT </ORGANIZATION>, said he learned of what he considered fraudulent research by <ORGANIZATION> Thereza </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Imanishi-Kari </ORGANIZATION> but was reluctant to report it until just before receiving his degree. Dr. <PERSON> Maplethorpe </PERSON> said he told an <ORGANIZATION> MIT </ORGANIZATION> official that he suspected fraud and the official's only action was to give him a form to fill out. `` I felt there was no question that if I made a formal charge of fraud it would not be taken seriously and I would be the person worst off for it,'' he said. Appearing today under subpoena before the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee on oversight and investigations, <PERSON> Maplethorpe </PERSON> said he was very reluctant to present the testimony and would not be there except for the legal compulsion. `` There is a tremendous disincentive to come forward and once they come forward, the instigators will pay a price,'' he said. The testimony came during hearings on practices of fraud in the government's $ 5-billion biomedical research program. In testimony before another subcommittee yesterday, <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON> and Dr. <PERSON> Ned </PERSON> <PERSON> Feder </PERSON>, two <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institutes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> scientists, said they have received unfavorable job ratings since they have acted as whistleblowers about false research data reported by <ORGANIZATION> NIH </ORGANIZATION> grant recipients. <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON> and <PERSON> Feder </PERSON> said they began investigating allegations of misconduct by grant recipients about four years ago. Although <ORGANIZATION> NIH </ORGANIZATION> officially allows them to spend 20 percent of their time investigating scientific fraud, <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON> said, he discovered in 1985 that his laboratory equipment at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Diabetes </ORGANIZATION> and Digestive and Kidney Diseases had been removed and junked without notice. <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON> and <PERSON> Feder </PERSON>, whose work had always been judged satisfactory, said they began getting unfavorable job evaluations, which were reversed on appeal. <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON> said their troubles clearly stemmed from their inquiries into fraudulent practices by <ORGANIZATION> NIH </ORGANIZATION> grant recipients. Another whistleblower who complained of mistreatment was Dr. <PERSON> Jerome </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jacobstein </PERSON>, who said `` I have been ignored by my friends, vilified by my enemies, despised, hated, condemned and on a rare but satisfying occasion, perhaps, respected.'' <PERSON> Jacobstein </PERSON> alleged that Dr. <PERSON> Jeffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Borer </PERSON>, a cardiologist and <ORGANIZATION> Cornell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> professor, attempted to induce a student to make numerous misrepresentations in a joint scientific study report. He said <PERSON> Borer </PERSON> ultimately got away with a mild rebuke. <PERSON> Jacobstein </PERSON> estimated that although extreme forms of research fraud, such as wholesale fabrication of data, were `` fairly rare,'' an estimated 20 percent to 30 percent of research studies supported by <ORGANIZATION> NIH </ORGANIZATION> grants contained unethically flawed data. `` A scientist who cheats injures other scientists by misleading them, and he injures the public by wasting their money and sometimes by falsely claiming discoveries that directly affect the public health and welfare,'' <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON> and <PERSON> Feder </PERSON> said Monday in a joint statement to the subcommittee. Rep. <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Weiss </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, chairman of the House Government Operations panel, expressed sympathy for a suggestion by Rep. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Conyers </PERSON>, D-Mich., that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> should approve criminal penalties for scientific fraud or misconduct because of its threat of `` incredible harm and injury to the public. The whistleblowers, who also included Professor <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sprague </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> at <ORGANIZATION> Urbana-Champaign </ORGANIZATION>, complained that criminal penalties would be excessively harsh and might create a damaging climate of fear among scientists. The witnesses all expressed hope that the scientific community might find a way to improve internal safeguards against research abuses. But <PERSON> Weiss </PERSON> said no one _ neither the <ORGANIZATION> NIH </ORGANIZATION>, the universities receiving research grants nor professional scientific societies _ had shown willingness to solve the fraud problem.

 Police Chief <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> <PERSON> Prince </PERSON>, under fire from top city officials for criticizing <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> members and opposing police reforms, resigned today. <PERSON> Prince </PERSON> said he is stepping down immediately, and city manager <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Knight </PERSON> appointed first assistant police chief <PERSON> Louie </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Caudell </PERSON> as interim chief, police Sgt. <PERSON> Carol </PERSON> <PERSON> Eberhardt </PERSON> said. `` I do n't want to be a lame-duck leader or a lame-duck chief,'' said <PERSON> Prince </PERSON>. He said he will serve in an advisory role through the summer. <PERSON> Prince </PERSON>, who has been chief for six years, said he is tired of the battling between the community and his beleaguered department. `` I made this decision, after an 11-day vacation, on Easter Sunday,'' <PERSON> Prince </PERSON> said at a news conference. `` I woke up Easter Sunday and just did n't feel good about returning. I told my wife then, ` I think it's time for me to go.''' It was n't one event that led to his decision, but `` I would not be totally truthful if I said I liked the atmosphere we've been working under. It's very trying and it wears you down.'' <PERSON> Prince </PERSON> said he was not forced out of the $ 87,000 per-year job, and said he will now concentrate on business interests. `` I'm 45 years old, and I feel I'm at a part of my life when if I'm going to change, now's the time to do it,'' he said. <PERSON> Prince </PERSON>, a 24-year <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> police veteran, has discussed his resignation with <PERSON> Knight </PERSON> and other associates several times in the last few weeks, officials said. His resignation comes at a time of tension between police and the minority community. He has been caught between the demands of a majority of the City Council, including Mayor <PERSON> Annette </PERSON> <PERSON> Strauss </PERSON>, who want more police accountability, and the <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> police union, which opposes greater control. Some minority community leaders, including City Councilwoman <PERSON> Diane </PERSON> <PERSON> Ragsdale </PERSON> and County Commissioner <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Wiley </PERSON> <PERSON> Price </PERSON>, have called for Prince's dismissal. City Councilman <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Rucker </PERSON> said he was angered by the reports and called Prince a `` scapegoat for the mayor and the city manager.'' `` What a horrible thing for <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Rucker </PERSON> said. `` I think it's a tragedy for a man to be hounded out of his office by demagogues.'' <PERSON> Rucker </PERSON>, who has considered running for mayor, predicted <PERSON> Prince </PERSON>'s resignation would be an issue in the 1989 municipal elections `` I think the people will finally say this is the last straw,'' <PERSON> Rucker </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Prince </PERSON> has been at odds with the <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> since late last year, when <PERSON> Knight </PERSON> rebuked <PERSON> Prince </PERSON> for lobbying against police reforms recommended by Mrs. <PERSON> Strauss </PERSON>' Advisory Committee on Crime. The aftermath of the Jan. 23 slaying of officer <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> <PERSON> Chase </PERSON> by a vagrant in downtown parking lot put Prince on a collision course with the city's elected leadership. <PERSON> Prince </PERSON> said some <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> members shared blame for <PERSON> Chase </PERSON>'s death because they had created an atmosphere of hostility toward police Mrs. <PERSON> Strauss </PERSON> asked <PERSON> Prince </PERSON> to retract his statements, which she said heightened racial tensions, but he refused to back down.

 For those who wo n't wait until death do them part, divorce counselor <PERSON> Sheila </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> has a word or two to ease hard feelings. She asks divorcing couples to join hands and tell each other something like: `` Goodbye. Thank you for the good times in our marriage. I wish you luck in your new life. Our relationship will continue as mother and father of our children, but not as husband and wife.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> works for the city of <LOCATION> Birmingham </LOCATION> as a divorce courts welfare lawyer. Divorced and remarried herself, she says she pioneered her ritual from personal experience. The wording of the farewell varies, depending on the personalities involved. But the general idea is to help divorcing parents come to terms with the split and be nice to each other, especially when waging child custody battles. With 168,100 marital breakups in 1986, or three per 1,000 people, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> has the highest rate of divorce in <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. Experts say one-third of British marriages are doomed to fail. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s tough marital law was reformed in 1971, changing grounds for divorce from marital misconduct to irretrievable breakdown. The divorce rate soared again after 1984, when the waiting period for a divorce was reduced from three years to one. In <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, communities provide free counseling to couples in the throes of divorce. Mrs. <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> said she and 19 other advisers under her command are all using her method. `` What I do is listen to the language,'' she said in a telephone interview from the <LOCATION> Birmingham </LOCATION> office where she counsels estranged couples. `` If I'm going to suggest the wording, I want to be sure it's appropriate to the couple,'' she said Often, she and the couple link hands for the ritual. `` Nine times out of 10 we all end up in tears,'' she said. <PERSON> Renata </PERSON> <PERSON> Olins </PERSON>, director of a counseling organization called <ORGANIZATION> London </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marriage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guidance </ORGANIZATION>, said it was a good idea. `` When you get divorced you get a piece of paper through the post. It's pretty bleak. So I think the idea of a ritual, a rite of passage, sounds quite therapeutic. The paradox is that the qualities you need to make the ending good are the same as those you need to make a relationship good,'' she said in an interview. <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Boler </PERSON>, editor of the marriage magazine Brides, was less sure of Mrs. <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>'s approach. `` She's living in a charming paradise,'' she told The Independent newspaper. In her experience, she said, `` most separating people are far too angry with each other for a ceremony like that. Often women have been ditched with young children, and they certainly are not going to wish their partner good luck in a new life. It really is rather unrealistic.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> said: `` Some people think I'm in cuckoo land. Of course, you ca n't do it with every single couple. Not every single couple should go through it. I decide on the basis of working with the couples.'' She says the idea is catching on around the country, and last year she lectured on it to marriage guidance counselors visiting from <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. Occasionally, Mrs. <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> says, her ritual even can help rescue a marriage. `` People can feel pretty silly saying the words. Sometimes it prompts them to think again.''

<HEAD>Army Says Number of Leaking Weapons Likely to Grow</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TIM AHERN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The Army has more than 1,000 leaking chemical weapons and the problem is likely to worsen in future years, service officials said Tuesday. The leaking weapons are discovered by a complex series of sensors at the eight <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> sites where they are stored, witnesses told the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> strategic weapons subcommittee. `` That's frightening, 1,000 leakers,'' said Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ohio </LOCATION>. `` That's a serious problem ... the problem is not going to get less'' as the weapons get even older. Army Brig. Gen. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Nydam </PERSON> estimated the number of leaking weapons at `` more than 1,000,'' but added that the figure was only `` a small percentage'' of the total <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> arsenal. He agreed with <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON>'s assessment that the situation will worsen as the stockpile ages. <PERSON> Nydam </PERSON> said the exact size of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> chemical arsenal is classified. Published estimates have range from 25,000 to 40,000 tons, however. When leaking weapons are discovered, they are enclosed in larger containers and then stored separately from the other weapons, <PERSON> Nydam </PERSON> said. The weapons are stored in closed bunkers and are periodically checked to see if any are leaking, <PERSON> Nydam </PERSON> said. Until recent months, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> had n't built any chemical weapons since 1969 and the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>'s stockpile is now on average more than 25 years old. Unitary weapons include shells and bombs that are filled with a variety of nerve gases and chemicals. As part of the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>'s program of building new weapons, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> ordered the service to come up with a safe method for destruction of the existing stockpile. The Army has told <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> that it prefers to build closed incinerators at the eight <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> sites because it is too dangerous to move the weapons. The weapons are stored at the <ORGANIZATION> Aberdeen </ORGANIZATION> Proving Ground, Md.; <ORGANIZATION> Anniston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Depot </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Ala. </LOCATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Lexington-Blue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Grass </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Depot </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Newport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ammunition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Plant </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Ind </LOCATION>.; Pine Bluff Arsenal, Ark.; <ORGANIZATION> Pueblo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Depot </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Colo. </LOCATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Tooele </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Depot </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>; and <ORGANIZATION> Umatilla </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Depot </ORGANIZATION>, Ore. The largest stockpile, 42 percent of the total, is stored at <LOCATION> Tooele </LOCATION>. The list does not include <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> weapons stationed in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> or stored on <PERSON> Johnston </PERSON> <PERSON> Atoll </PERSON>, a deserted island 400 miles south of <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Shannon </PERSON>, assistant secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, told the subcommittee that the service is pushing ahead with plans to build the incineration plants, despite some strong local opposition. <PERSON> Shannon </PERSON> said the criticism has come from communities around the <ORGANIZATION> Aberdeen </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Newport </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Lexington </LOCATION> plants. The other five `` have expressed the desire that we get on with it,'' he said. Sen. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, R-Ind., criticized the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> for its approach to swaying public opinion at the <LOCATION> Newport </LOCATION> site `` There's been some progress, but we've got a long way to go,'' he said. `` We in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> become involved when our constituency feels it is short-changed,'' and that is the situation in <LOCATION> Newport </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Shannon </PERSON> agreed, saying: `` We did not do a good job in <LOCATION> Newport </LOCATION> in the beginning, we'll have to do better.'' <PERSON> Shannon </PERSON> estimated the total cost of destruction at $ 2.7 billion and said the job will be completed by 1997, if the plants go ahead now.

<HEAD>Ozone-Destroying Chemicals To Be Gone From Food Containers Next
Year</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GUY DARST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Makers of plastic foam food containers will stop using ozone-destroying chemicals in their products after this year, the first industry to give up the compounds completely, their trade association said Tuesday. Major environmental groups and the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> hailed the decision by members of the <ORGANIZATION> Foodservice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Packing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> as an important symbolic step in persuading others to find substitutes for the chlorofluorocarbon, or <ORGANIZATION> CFC </ORGANIZATION>, compounds. Consumers will notice little impact because the the decision does not mean an end to foam containers, valued for their lightness and insulating properties _ things like egg cartons and the clamshell hamburger containers used by fast-food chains. Two-thirds of those foams currently are made without CFCs. There are about 15 companies making the food packages, said <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bow </PERSON>, president of the institute, and more than a third of them have signed a letter pledging to give up CFCs by the end of the year. `` In 30 days we should have the rest of the industry'' signed up, <PERSON> Bow </PERSON> said. About 1.5 percent to 2 percent of <ORGANIZATION> CFC </ORGANIZATION> use in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, or 15 million pounds a year, goes to foam blowing agents for food packages, though 30 percent is used in blowing agents for other foams such as seat cushions and insulating panels. Gaseous CFCs are released into the atmosphere during the foam manufacturing process and some of the compounds also remain trapped in the foam, where they may be released into the environment later. For environmentalists, though, the food packages were a visible symbol of the threat to the Earth's protective ozone layer, and they already had persuaded some fast food chains _ and the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> restaurant in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> _ not to use CFC-derived containers. Ozone at high altitudes protects the Earth from cancer-causing ultraviolet rays of the sun, but can be destroyed by chlorine liberated from the breakup of <ORGANIZATION> CFC </ORGANIZATION> compounds at those altitudes. Last month the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> reported that CFCs appear to have been responsible for an average 2.3 percent decline in the ozone shield at northern hemisphere mid-latitudes from 1969 to 1986. A treaty signed by 31 nations last fall requires a 50 percent cut in <ORGANIZATION> CFC </ORGANIZATION> production by 1998. Most of the replacement for CFCs in foam packages is expected to be a related compound, HCFC-22, which has only 5 percent of the ozone-destroying ability of the chemicals being given up. The Natural Resources Defense Council, the Environmental Defense Fund and Friends of the <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> agreed to work with the packing institute in finding an eventual replacement for HCFC-22. All three groups praised the industry, and <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> administrator <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> issued a statement praising the `` welcome contribution'' of less <ORGANIZATION> CFC </ORGANIZATION> use as `` a model of cooperation between industry and the environmental community.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION> said the announcement was even more significant than the <ORGANIZATION> Du </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pont </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>'s announcement last month that it wanted to end <ORGANIZATION> CFC </ORGANIZATION> production because <PERSON> Du </PERSON> <PERSON> Pont </PERSON> did not commit itself to a deadline the way the institute did. `` It is our intention to go to other sectors -LRB- of the economy -RRB- and say, ` These guys did it; so can you,''' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Doniger </PERSON>, attorney for the <ORGANIZATION> Natural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>. Current non-CFC blowing agents, mostly volatile hydrocarbons like pentane, pose environmental threats of their own since these compounds help form ozone at low altitudes, where it is a pollutant. The substitute material costs 25 percent to 50 percent more than the compounds it replaces, but lasts longer, so costs will be increased little if at all, Bow said.

 The Democratic presidential candidate's stroll through <LOCATION> Harlem </LOCATION> was unannounced but word swept the streets _ `` It's <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>! Children scampered up to touch him, women in curlers called out from upper-story windows, youths in jeans and basketball shoes hollered from the street, and old men hobbled over to see him walk by. It was an impromptu walk down <PERSON> Adam </PERSON> <PERSON> Clayton </PERSON> <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> <PERSON> Boulevard </PERSON> from the renowned <ORGANIZATION> Abyssinian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Baptist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> where he had preached on Sunday morning to <ORGANIZATION> Sylvia </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> restaurant 15 minutes away. `` Go <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON>,'' the crowds shouted. `` You've got my vote.'' `` <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON>, I pray for you,'' said one old lady. It was an incongruous sight. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, tall and crisply attired in dark blue suit, beamed as he walked hand in hand with his wife, <PERSON> Jacqueline </PERSON>, their son <PERSON> Jonathan </PERSON> astride. The candidate all but disappeared except for his head as he was swallowed by a gaggle of reporters and cameras, a phalanx of police officers and a team of <ORGANIZATION> Secret </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> agents. They walked a street lined with trash, gutted buildings, dilapidated stores and apartments, beat-up cars and broken sidewalks. But the street came alive with <LOCATION> Harlem </LOCATION> residents. In their excitement over <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, they bumped into security agents, running alongside and behind his entourage as if he were the Pied Piper. There seemed to be a sense that <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> was on home turf here. Speaking at the <ORGANIZATION> Abyssinian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> earlier, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> called the church's pastor, <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Proctor </PERSON>, his mentor. He recalled that <PERSON> Proctor </PERSON> and he had many discussions about the missions of the late <PERSON> Adam </PERSON> <PERSON> Clayton </PERSON> <PERSON> Powell </PERSON>, the local congressman who gained fame as the eloquent pastor of the same church, and about civil rights leader <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Luther </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON>. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> told the congregation there is still `` unfinished business'' in the agenda set by King, that poor people are still hungry and peace is still elusive. On his walk later, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> hugged passersby and lifted children. `` How you doin' brother,'' he called out. He approached a basketball court and some 15 young men raced to the chain-link fence around it. He could n't shake their hands through the fence, but they pressed their palms against one side and he put his against the other. They tossed him their ball, and he threw it back over the fence as they cheered wildly. `` I'm not going to wash my hand no more in my life,'' one middle-aged woman gushed after touching <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. A sidewalk bookseller told him, `` I sold out of your book.'' Two young women called to his wife that she was `` so lucky'' to have such an attractive husband. One of them shouted to <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, `` You're gon na win, you handsome devil.'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> laughed as a boy of about 10 took his hand and chattered about his family and point out where his relatives lived. Someone pointed out two tall palm trees in a deserted lot that were stripped of their fronds, painted crazily and had basketball hoops suspended about 30 feet in the air. `` Ai n't no goal too high, right <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON>?'' said a man following the candidate.

 Chinese leaders on Tuesday elected a new cabinet in a vote that indicates a general support for <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaoping </PERSON>'s economic reforms although several conservatives received key posts <PERSON> Qian </PERSON> <PERSON> Qichen </PERSON>, 60, a career diplomat who has been <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s chief negotiator with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, was elected as minister of Foreign Affairs, succeeding <PERSON> Wu </PERSON> <PERSON> Xueqian </PERSON>, 67. Gen. <PERSON> Qin </PERSON> <PERSON> Jiwei </PERSON>, 74, a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Politburo </ORGANIZATION> and commander of the <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> Military Region, took over the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> from ailing <PERSON> Zhang </PERSON> <PERSON> Aiping </PERSON>, 78. Continuing an unprecedented movement started at the beginning of congress, delegates at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> actually voted against some of the cabinet candidates. In congresses past, all candidates were elected unanimously. The congress, which is <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s legislature, also passed two amendments to the constitution. One guarantees the rights of private businessmen, while the other recognizes the transfer of land-use rights, opening the way for the leasing of property. In voting by 2,859 delegates, the congress approved three vice premiers, nine state councillors and 41 ministers for the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, or cabinet. The stress was on continuity, with the large majority of ministers either keeping their jobs or turning them over to people within their organizations. The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> is headed by <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Peng </PERSON>, 59, who was formally endorsed as premier earlier in the congress' annual session. Named as vice premiers were <PERSON> Yao </PERSON> <PERSON> Yilin </PERSON> and <PERSON> Tian </PERSON> <PERSON> Jiyun </PERSON>, both returnees, and the outgoing foreign minister, <PERSON> Wu </PERSON>. The delegates were not given a choice in who they could pick for each office, although they could oppose the candidate or abstain from voting. The one surprise was the election of <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Guixian </PERSON>, a Soviet-trained engineer and party boss in <LOCATION> Anhui </LOCATION> province, to be governor of the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> China </ORGANIZATION>, the central bank. <PERSON> Li </PERSON>, with no known financial background, will be responsible for the major task of reforming <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s inflexible banking system to allow interest rates to replace central planning in the management of the bank. According to New Evening Post a <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> daily, he received 404 opposing votes and 29 abstentions, more than any other candidate. As head of the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Qin </PERSON>, one of <PERSON> Deng </PERSON>'s confidantes, is expected to carry out <PERSON> Deng </PERSON>'s plan to mold the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> into a more powerful body. The ministry is now the weak sister to party and state military commissions both headed by <PERSON> Deng </PERSON>. Qian, the new foreign minister, is expected to follow closely the policies laid down by Wu, foreign minister since 1982. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> in that period has steadily expanded economic and political ties with the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> while gradually easing tensions with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. The official news agency <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> described the new government as `` a group of technocrats who are younger in age, pragmatic and enthusiastic in the reform.'' It said the average age of the cabinet dipped from 62 to 59 and that all but five members are college graduates. Premier <PERSON> Li </PERSON>, a Soviet-trained engineer who is considered conservative when compared to <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> <PERSON> Ziyang </PERSON>, took over the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Restructuring </ORGANIZATION> the Economy. Senior Vice Premier <PERSON> Yao </PERSON>, who also wants to slow the pace of reform, was named head of the new <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Planning </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. One constitutional amendment guarantees the rights and interests of the 21.5 million Chinese now engaged in 13.7 million private businesses. Private entrepreneurs, operating small food and clothing stalls and restaurants, now account for almost 13 percent of the nation's total retail sales. The other amendment, also tied to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s policy of giving greater flexibility to its economy, states that `` the right to the use of land may be transferred according to law.'' <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> has experimented with transfer of land-use rights as part of efforts to provide land to more ambitious farmers and accelerate urban development. The congress, which closes Wednesday, has been hailed as the most democratic in history, with delegates encouraged to speak out on such issues as inflation and faltering agricultural production.

<TEXT>
 Limousines were bumper-to-bumper on <LOCATION> Sunset </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Boulevard </LOCATION> early today as celebrities made their way to two big post-Oscar parties. Hollywood glamor mixed with political activism at a benefit for Central American refugees that drew such stars as <PERSON> Rosanna </PERSON> <PERSON> Arquette </PERSON>, Morgan Fairchild and <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Cage </PERSON> to the ultra-modern Le Mondrian Hotel. Meanwhile literary agent <PERSON> Swifty </PERSON> <PERSON> Lazar </PERSON>'s annual bash drew a crowd at the trendy <LOCATION> Spago </LOCATION> restaurant. About 600 people paid $ 500 each to attend the <ORGANIZATION> Le </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mondrian </ORGANIZATION> fund-raiser for <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Escerte </ORGANIZATION>, an organization that provides board, food and medical care for Central American refugees. Outdoors at poolside under a glittering night sky, Ms. Fairchild and Ms. <PERSON> Arquette </PERSON> chatted as the head of the <PERSON> Stallone </PERSON> clan, outspoken <PERSON> Jacqueline </PERSON> <PERSON> Stallone </PERSON>, swept through with her non-Rambo son, <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>. <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Cage </PERSON> of `` Moonstruck'' stopped by after midnight, joining such other partygoers as <PERSON> Olivia </PERSON> <PERSON> Hussey </PERSON>, <PERSON> Tina </PERSON> <PERSON> Yothers </PERSON> and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Amos </PERSON>. `` I wanted to get into the spirit of the Oscars. It's fun and exciting,'' said <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Hussey </PERSON>, whose films include `` Romeo and Juliet.'' `` I'm here to raise money for Central American refugees. It's a very good cause,'' said <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Arquette </PERSON>, who has appeared in such films as `` Silverado,'' `` Desperately Seeking Susan'' and `` The Executioner's Song.'' <PERSON> Esai </PERSON> <PERSON> Morales </PERSON>, who played rock singer <PERSON> Ritchie </PERSON> <PERSON> Valens </PERSON>' brother in the film `` <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bamba </LOCATION>,'' was co-chairman of the event. `` This is an Oscar party with a conscience,'' said another co-chairman, 22-year-old producer <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Sladek </PERSON>. `` Swifty's represents old <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION>. This crowd represents a new generation of young Hollywood who are socially committed, who go to an Oscar party and pay for it, rather than crash it.'' But although glitter was not in short supply at <LOCATION> Le </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mondrian </LOCATION>, the main event was still at <LOCATION> Spago </LOCATION>, where the scene was nearly as glamorous as the Oscars ceremony itself. Many of <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION>'s glitterati watched the telecast at the balloon and streamer-bedecked restaurant rather than brave rush-hour traffic to the Shrine Auditorium 10 miles away Among the celebrities in attendance at the invitation-only fete were <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>, <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Mancini </PERSON>, <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Rickles </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Newhart </PERSON> and <PERSON> Suzanne </PERSON> <PERSON> Pleshette </PERSON>. <PERSON> Sean </PERSON> <PERSON> Connery </PERSON>, Best Supporting Oscar in hand, dropped in after the ceremony.

<HEAD>Zimbabwe Says It May Send More Troops to Mozambique</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The government may move troops from a formerly embattled western province to <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION>, where they would fight right-wing rebels, the defense minister said Tuesday. The soldiers were sent to <LOCATION> Matabeleland </LOCATION> province six years ago to hunt down armed dissidents. However, rebel activity has vanished there since President <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Mugabe </PERSON> and former opposition leader <PERSON> Joshua </PERSON> <PERSON> Nkomo </PERSON> signed a unity accord Dec. 22, Defense Minister <PERSON> Enos </PERSON> <PERSON> Nkala </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Zimbabwe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inter-African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>. The dissidents battled for <PERSON> Nkomo </PERSON> in the seven-year war that transformed white-ruled <LOCATION> Rhodesia </LOCATION> into black-governed <LOCATION> Zimbabwe </LOCATION> on April 18, 1980. However, they left the army two years later to fight the new government, killing hundreds of black peasants and more than 60 whites. The parties of <PERSON> Nkomo </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mugabe </PERSON> last week approved a merger expected to lead to one-party rule by <PERSON> Mugabe </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Zimbabwe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>. The defense chief said the government could plan for withdrawing soldiers from <LOCATION> Matabeleland </LOCATION> and deploying them instead to assist the government of neighboring <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION>. About 12,000 of <PERSON> Mugabe </PERSON>'s troops are in <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION> guarding trade routes and an oil pipeline vital to landlocked <LOCATION> Zimbabwe </LOCATION>'s economy. The military chief did not say how many troops might be moved. The area is threatened by rebels fighting the government of Marxist President <PERSON> Joaquim </PERSON> <PERSON> Chissano </PERSON>.

 Ex-Gov. <PERSON> Evan </PERSON> <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>'s brief administration has sparked the historical interest of both the <ORGANIZATION> Smithsonian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institution </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Arizona </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Historical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>, a first-term Republican in office just over a year, was removed from office April 4 when the state <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> convicted him of two impeachment charges. He also was the subject of recall drive and faces a May 19 trial on criminal charges accusing him of concealing a $ 350,000 campaign loan. The state society's Central Division is building an extensive collection of material relating to recall him, <PERSON> Andy </PERSON> <PERSON> Masich </PERSON>, division director, said Monday. The <ORGANIZATION> Smithsonian </ORGANIZATION>'s interest began about a month ago. <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Bird </PERSON>, curator of the Division of Political History of the institution's <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Museum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> History </ORGANIZATION>, asked a <LOCATION> Tucson </LOCATION> museum official to send him a bumper sticker and a couple of campaign buttons commemorating the campaign against <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> `` Normally, our contemporary collection is limited to national politics,'' <PERSON> Bird </PERSON> said in a telephone interview. `` But this is a relatively unusual event.'' <PERSON> Diane </PERSON> <PERSON> Dittemore </PERSON>, curator of the <ORGANIZATION> Arizona </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Museum </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Tucson </LOCATION>, said she sent <PERSON> Bird </PERSON> a bumper sticker reading `` King Had A Dream, <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> Has A Nightmare,'' and two buttons, a red-and-white one saying `` <ORGANIZATION> Mecham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Watchdog </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>,'' and a yellow-and-black one reading `` Recall Ev.'' <PERSON> Edith </PERSON> <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON>, <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>'s campaign manager, said of the <ORGANIZATION> Smithsonian </ORGANIZATION>'s acquisition: `` I think it's rather sad for an institution we all regard so highly to display such material.'' <PERSON> Bird </PERSON>, who studied at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arizona </ORGANIZATION>, said he was n't sure that the recall material would become a part of the museum's permanent `` We asked for the memorabilia as a matter of routine,'' he said. `` It's not as if we're making a federal case out of it. Any scholar who wants to study the phenomenon of the <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> recall is more likely to contact a museum there for material than the Smithsonian.'' <PERSON> Masich </PERSON> said the society contacted the recall headquarters before it closed and got an extensive donation of campaign materials. `` I'm sure we'll be collecting a lot more,'' he added.

 <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> today sharply criticized his predecessor, <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Speakes </PERSON>, for falsely attributing remarks to President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and vowed that he would never follow such a practice himself. `` It's a damned outrage, that's what it is,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> told reporters at his regular daily briefing. When reporters bombarded <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> with questions about <PERSON> Speakes </PERSON>' statements, made in his book `` Speaking Out,'' the spokesman said the questions illustrated `` why I resent it so much. `` To make up quotes casts aspersions on the presidency and on my position and the questions you just asked are the best reasons why it ` s wrong, why he should n't have done it and why I won ` t do it,'' he said. `` Everyone is appalled that he made up quotes,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> added. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said he takes notes during presidential meetings and, `` If he did n't say it, I wo n't say he said it. I never have.'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said he had not talked to the president about the matter, but `` I am sure he would be upset about it. I am sure he is.'' The spokesman also said he had not talked with <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Weinberg </PERSON>, an assistant press secretary who <PERSON> Speakes </PERSON> said helped him make up quotations to attribute to <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> during his 1985 summit meeting with Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>. `` I do n't know what his role was there,'' he said of <PERSON> Weinberg </PERSON>. `` Clearly he was doing what <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> wanted, and he would not do anything that I do not want him to do.'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> was a deputy under <PERSON> Speakes </PERSON>, but had left the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and was Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s press secretary at the time of the incidents described by the former spokesman. <PERSON> Speakes </PERSON>, interviewed by telephone from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, had no reaction to <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>'s statement. `` I'd be better off not to comment,'' he said. But he offered no apoligies, saying `` It's an honest book.'' <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Redman </PERSON>, asked about the practice of making up quotes, said, `` I do n't do it.'' <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Weyrich </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Free </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>, talking to reporters after an hour-long meeting of conservatives with the president, said, `` I think that the president is ill-served by all of these people who are in public service and then write books the minute they get out and reveal things that ought not to be revealed.'' `` I don ` t condone the kind of self-serving, ` I really was the president' type attitude of <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Deaver </PERSON> and <PERSON> Speakes </PERSON> and all the rest,'' <PERSON> Weyrich </PERSON> said. `` All they're in it for is making a buck ... and frankly, they ought to be ashamed of themselves.'' <PERSON> Speakes </PERSON> says in his book that after a <ORGANIZATION> Korean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lines </ORGANIZATION> plane carrying 61 Americans was shot down in 1983, he credited statements made by Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> to <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. And he says that during <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s summit meeting with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> he attributed to <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> remarks that he and <PERSON> Weinberg </PERSON> had manufactured. <PERSON> Speakes </PERSON> said today the two instances he mentions of manufactured quotes `` were the only two that I specifically recall that we did. It was a case of knowing the president well and knowing how he felt about the events taking place and knowing what he would say.'' The former spokesman also said he had informed <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> of the made-up quotes. `` I generally told him, you know, what I had done, you know, and the reasons for doing it. He never objected to, you know, these cases where I said, you know, I've gone ahead and done this,'' <PERSON> Speakes </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Speakes </PERSON> often boasted that he never lied to the press during his six years as <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s chief spokesman. His book is scheduled for publication next month by <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Scribner </PERSON>'s Sons. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> met with the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> and with congressional leaders after a Soviet plane shot down the <ORGANIZATION> KAL </ORGANIZATION> aircraft on Aug. 31, 1983. <PERSON> Speakes </PERSON> says <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> declared during the congressional leaders' meeting that the incident was not a problem between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> but `` a Soviet versus the world problem. `` Since the president had had almost nothing to say during the National Security and congressional leadership meetings, I made presidential quotes out of <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>' comment about the incident pitting the whole world against the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, as well as some of <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>' suggestions about what retaliatory steps we should take,'' <PERSON> Speakes </PERSON> writes. `` My decision to put <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>' words in <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s mouth played well and neither of them complained.'' In his account ofthe <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> summit, <PERSON> Speakes </PERSON> says he `` felt that <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> was really getting the advantage over us in his give-and-take with reporters, while <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was very tentative and stilted'' in his comments. `` Fearing that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was losing the media version of Star Wars, I instructed <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Weinberg </PERSON> to draft some quotes for the president,'' <PERSON> Speakes </PERSON> says. `` I polished the quotes and told the press that while the two leaders stood together at the end of one session, the president said to <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, ` There is much that divides us, but I believe the world breathes easier because we are talking here together.''' <PERSON> Speakes </PERSON> says that <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> used the quote in its evening television news and <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Wallace </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> reported `` the talks were frank. The president's best statement came off camera, aides quoting him as saying, ` The world breathes easier because we are talking together.''' `` Another <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> quote which we manufactured that received extensive play in the press was, ` Our differences are serious but so is our commitment to improving understanding,''' <PERSON> Speakes </PERSON> writes. `` In retrospect, it was clearly wrong to take such liberties,'' the former spokesman says in his account of the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> meeting. `` Certainly, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> would not have disavowed the words, but the Soviets could have said they never heard anything like that. Luckily, the Russians did n't dispute the quotes and I had been able to spruce up the president's image by taking a bit of liberty with my PR man's license.'' In an interview published today in <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Speakes </PERSON> said that making up presidential quotes `` is not lying.'' `` When you're a press secretary, you develop a bond of understanding with the president so that you think like the president,'' he said. `` I knew those quotes were the way he felt.''

<HEAD>Committee Will Let Senate Decide on Mexican Drug Efforts</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM DRINKARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A sharply divided <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> refused to slap <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> on Tuesday over its failings in the war on drugs, leaving that decision to the full <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, where it could come to a vote in the next few days. The panel did approve a similar resolution condemning the <LOCATION> Bahamas </LOCATION> for not doing enough to combat drug trafficking, and moved to add <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION> to the list of countries that should come under increased scrutiny as drug producing or transit points. The vote on the <LOCATION> Bahamas </LOCATION> issue was 10-6, and the <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION> resolution passed on a voice vote. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> admnistration last month certified that <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Bahamas </LOCATION> are `` fully cooperating'' with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> efforts to halt drug trafficking. Such a certification is required for any foreign country identified as a drug producing or transit point to continue to receive <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid and other benefits. But Sen. <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, R-Calif., objected to the <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> certification, pointing to continued high rates of marijuana and cocaine flowing into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> from that country and problems with official corruption and lack of cooperation with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> drug interdiction authorities <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> proposed a resolution to decertify <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, which could subject it to aid, lending and trade sanctions under <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> law. The Foreign Relations panel, after lengthy debate over the effect of such a move on overall <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> relations with <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, defeated an effort to send the bill to the floor with a favorable recommendation. The vote was an 8-8 tie, which defeated the motion under committee rules. In effect, the action left the decision to the full <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, since the bill has priority status and must go to the floor for final action in any case. But Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Kerry </PERSON>, D-Mass., who has been holding hearings on Latin American drug trafficking, said the move represented a victory in the war on drugs `` It reflects the changing mood and dynamic in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Kerry </PERSON> said, noting that several senators had switched sides on the issue in light of a growing awareness of the drug problem. <PERSON> Kerry </PERSON> predicted a hard-fought debate when the measure comes to the floor later this week or next week, and said he could not predict the outcome. The measure is primarily symbolic in its impact on foreign aid, since <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s only current <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid is $ 14.5 million in money to combat drugs, money which would be unaffected by any sanctions. More important for <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, however, could be a requirement that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> oppose future loans from international development banks. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has a weighted vote in decisions on such loans, but not a majority. Decertification also could expose <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> to various trade sanctions, at the discretion of the president. Arguing for the <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> resolution, <PERSON> Kerry </PERSON> noted that the administration itself had noted numerous failings by <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> when it certified full cooperation on March 1, noting that a `` higher level'' of cooperation was needed. `` You ca n't have it both ways,'' <PERSON> Kerry </PERSON> said. `` The point has really arrived where other countries are watching us,'' he said, noting that <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> ruler Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, indicted in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> on drug trafficking charges, seems to be drawing strength from <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> confusion over its policy toward him.

If this resolution is adopted, you can expect the worst kind of cooperation.''

 The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> today recommended a massive, U.N.-sponsored effort to help <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s estimated eight million refugees `` return in safety and honor'' as Soviet troops withdraw. <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was prepared to help plan the return of the Afghans, most of whom fled to <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> to escape Soviet attacks, but he said `` the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> and its specialized agencies are the logical organizations to coordinate the job.'' <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said that `` a constructive effort is taking place to work out an interim government and to help the refugees return in safety and honor.'' He said there was no timetable for the return of the refugees and added: `` This process has to be done in such a way that it's done securly, that these people are taken care of. There is obviously going to be some social disorganization inside <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> as this proceeds. We need to try to do this in a coordinated way.'' The return of the Afghan refugees and the withdrawal of Soviet troops are envisioned in a four-part accord that <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> and the Afghan rebels are scheduled to sign on Thursday. Although White House spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> told reporters at a briefing that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s conservative supporters were `` very supportive and very happy'' with the Afghan agreement, a group of conservative leaders met with the president for an hour today and expressed concerns about the pact. `` We think the administration is well-intentioned, but we question the results,'' <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Weyrich </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Free </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>, said afterwards. Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> acknowledged it will be difficult to end the fighting even after the Soviets leave the country, but he predicted the withdrawal will bring some stability to the war-torn nation. `` I ... expect that the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> will withdraw fully from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, and then the people of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> have got to work things out,'' <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said. `` That's their right and their problem.'' The secretary met with reporters after President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> announced on Monday that he was dispatching <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> to <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> to sign the troop-withdrawal accords negotiated last week between <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> lauded the U.S.-backed rebels, who have battled the <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> regime since the 1979 Soviet invasion. `` This development would not have been possible had it not been for the valiant struggle of the Afghan people to rid their country of foreign occupation,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said. `` We take great pride in having assisted the Afghan people in this triumph and they can count on our continued support.'' Asked about charges from conservatives that the agreement is a sellout of the rebels, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> replied, `` We are not.'' Under the agreement, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> will guarantee a plan dictating the removal of the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>'s 115,000 troops from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. The plan has been worked out under the auspices of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> and is expected to be signed on Thursday. The pullout is set to begin May 15, only two weeks before <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> is scheduled to fly to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> for his fourth summit session with Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. The rebels, or mujahedeen, were not part of the talks. They have rejected the agreement and pledged to continue fighting to topple the <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> government. Yet under a compromise with <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> that is not a formal part of the accords, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will continue sending weapons to the rebels, while the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> continues providing arms to the Marxist government. Asked if <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> pledges to continue supporting the rebels contradict the formal agreement, <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> replied only, `` I'm not going to step into that hole.'' He said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would continue to aid the rebels `` as needed.'' `` We have stood by the Afghan people during this 8 -LCB- years and we're prepared to stand by them in the coming months to help Afghans return home and begin rebuilding their lives and their country,'' he added. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> called the agreement `` historic,'' while <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> hailed it as `` a major ... international success.'' `` This is the first time in the history of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> that they have moved by aggression into another country and then had to withdraw,'' <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said. The secretary acknowledged that the removal of Soviet troops will not necessarily mean an end to the fighting between the <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> regime and the rebels. He said he expected the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> mediator, <PERSON> Diego </PERSON> <PERSON> Cordovez </PERSON>, to `` do everything he can to develop an interim government.'' `` We know it's not easy,'' <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said. `` It will be hard.'' But on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>, Sen. <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.H. </LOCATION>, denounced the agreement as amounting to a `` slow-motion sellout'' of the resistance fighters. `` It's a poor deal, a very bad deal,'' he said. `` The Soviets are perfectly free under this agreement to resupply the communist puppet regime in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> just as lavishly as they please.'' The accord calls for the return to <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> of millions of Afghan refugees, most of whom moved to neighboring <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>. `` Undoubtedly there will be a massive movement of refugees from outside <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> into <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, by the millions,'' <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said. `` So, there will be immense social dislocation and potential for suffering, and we and others in the international community will want to do everything we can to ease that transition.'' The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has urged the appointment of a special <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> coordinator to oversee repatriation. `` In our view, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, having inflicted so much suffering on the <LOCATION> Afghan </LOCATION> people, has a special obligation to provide resources for this resettlement,'' <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said. Under the accord, some 50 percent of the Soviet forces are to be removed over a three-month period beginning in May. All remaining Soviet forces are to be out by Feb. 15, 1989. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said Soviet Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> has promised to complete the withdrawal by the end of the year, ahead of the deadline. He said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will `` push for that and expect that.''

<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>

 The Archdiocese of <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> said Tuesday it will not take disciplinary action against a priest at a suburban <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> parish who said Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> is `` dead wrong'' on the issue of celibacy. The Rev. <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Curran </PERSON> `` was very gracious in acknowledging the inaccuracy of some of his statements'' during a meeting with Monsignor <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> McDonough </PERSON> at the archdiocese offices, said the Rev. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Dora </PERSON>. <PERSON> Dora </PERSON>, communications director for the archdiocese, said <PERSON> Curran </PERSON> could have been suspended from his priestly functions as punishment. <PERSON> Curran </PERSON>, a priest for 21 years, told his parishioners at <ORGANIZATION> Stone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mountain </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Corpus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> last weekend that the doctrine of priestly celibacy leads to alcoholism and other aberrant behavior. <PERSON> Dora </PERSON> said the archdiocese had received `` numerous complaints from parishioners'' about <PERSON> Curran </PERSON>'s comments. <PERSON> Curran </PERSON>, 46, is associate pastor at <LOCATION> Corpus </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Christi </LOCATION>, which was rocked last week by the indictment of a former priest for child molestation and other offenses involving four altar boys. <PERSON> Dora </PERSON> said <PERSON> Curran </PERSON> will draft a letter to his parishioners clarifying his statements, and after <PERSON> McDonough </PERSON> approves the letter it will be read at Masses over the weekend. `` The diocese had problems with a priest using the pulpit to address his own opinions and concerns. That was the central issue as far as the diocese was concerned,'' <PERSON> Dora </PERSON> said. `` The question of celibacy will continue to be discussed openly and seriously within the <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> within the appropriate settings.'' <PERSON> Curran </PERSON> said Monday in a telephone interview that his parish's crisis `` is of a much larger context'' than charges against one priest `` I think the real issue is, when will the church deal with the truth of all the pain of celibacy as the clergy experience it?''

 <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> officials said today that <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON>, charged with air piracy and murder in the 1985 <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> hijacking to <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, will be tried before a juvenile court. The decision by the <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> state court means the 23-year-old <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> faces a maximum of 10 years imprisonment if convicted. If tried as an adult, <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> could have received life imprisonment if found guilty. <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON>'s trial had been expected to begin at the end of May, officials said last week. Today's decision made no mention of a date, although it indicated the start of the trial might be delayed. `` The Hesse state youth court will now need time to study the case files before it can decide on when <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON>'s trial will start,'' the court statement said. The statement, telexed to news media, said the state prosecutor's office in <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> had listed <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON>'s birth date as June 13, 1964. `` However, a possibility exists that the perpetration of the crime that he is accused of may have begun before June 13, 1985, and goes back to the time of his adolescence. `` Therefore, the case has been turned over to the youth court,'' the statement said. A federal <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said the juvenile court could decide to exclude the press from <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON>'s trial. `` The press can be excluded from the trial if the court finds it is in the best interest of the accused,'' said the spokesman, who spoke on condition of anonymity. He said the decision on whether to bar the press would not be made until the trial begins. The charges against <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> stem from a hijacking that began June 15, 1985. On that day, Shiite Moslem gunmen seized a <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> jetliner on an Athens-to-Rome flight and forced it to <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. One American, a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> diver, was killed during the hijacking and 39 Americans were held hostage for 17 days before being released. <PERSON> Abbas </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON>, 29, is on trial on charges of kidnapping two West Germans in an attempt to force authorities to release his brother, who was arrested at <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> airport Jan. 13, 1987, carrying liquid explosives and false documents. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> sought <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON>'s extradition on air piracy and murder charges. But <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> refused after the two Germans were kidnapped in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. One West German was freed in September. The other remains a captive.

 School teacher <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Weeks </PERSON> has donned the garb of a terrorist to get his seventh-grade students in <LOCATION> Murfreesboro </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>, to grapple with viewpoints diametrically opposed to their own. He also has posed as <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Anwar </PERSON> <PERSON> Sadat </PERSON> to bring history alive in his classroom. On Tuesday, Weeks assumed a new role that he will play for the next 12 months: the 1988 National Teacher of the Year. The 37-year-old social studies instructor from <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Middle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Murfreesboro </LOCATION> appeared on national television and held a news conference to kick off a celebratory week that includes a stop at the White House on Thursday to receive a crystal apple from President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. For Weeks, who makes $ 25,000 after 15 years in the classroom, it was a taste of adulation he said he wished all teachers could share. `` I wish somehow I could bundle it all up and as I go across the country this next year, just kind of spread it out to the teachers,'' he said. `` They need to know that there are news cameras waiting on the teacher of the year when he gets off of a plane, people wanting to know how he teaches ... and what is it that keeps him in the classroom.'' He also told reporters, `` I ca n't do the moon walk. I ca n't slam dunk a basketball. ... I'm a teacher.'' But Weeks, a director of the <ORGANIZATION> Tennessee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> and former president of his union local, also complained of low salaries and poor working conditions for public school teachers. `` Teachers by far represent the best bargain going for this country,'' said Weeks. `` Teachers need to have more control over what happens in the schools,'' including the curriculum, schedule and choice of textbooks. `` We are secretaries, we are filing clerks, we are psychologists, we have to be legal scholars, we ca n't go to the bathroom every time we need to go because there are 30 children in the classroom,'' he said. Weeks, whose wife, <PERSON> Mary </PERSON>, is a nurse, said he has stayed in the classroom despite low pay because every day `` I know I've had the opportunity to make a difference'' in the lives of 150 students. `` To me there's no more noble calling than teaching. But again, that's not to say I'm satisfied with the low salary.'' Weeks, a carpenter's son, is a graduate of <ORGANIZATION> Middle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tennessee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. He has been the seventh grade social studies teacher at <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Middle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> for 14 years. He said his posing as a terrorist, and other historical figures, is all aimed at forcing his students to think and not just memorize things. `` Nothing's simple any more. There's no yes-no answers any longer. Instead of just basic skills, I want to get to the depth to help them compare, contrast,'' he said. `` When I'm gone the problems we have today wo n't be the problems they will face, but the skills will enable them to deal with the problems. That's my main goal as a teacher.'' The teacher of the year competition is sponsored by the <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chief </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Officers </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Encylclopaedia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Britannica </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cos. </ORGANIZATION> and Good Housekeeping magazine.

<TEXT>
 For the dozens of passengers who began their second week as captives inside a sweltering jetliner, Flight 422 has become a journey of terror with mounting physical and psychological tensions. The blue-and-white <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 747 was hijacked over <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> on a flight from <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> eight days ago, but some of the hostages have lost track of time. `` It's been 10 days,'' complained passenger <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON> <PERSON> al-Gabandi </PERSON>, who was put on the radio Tuesday by the hijackers to beg for the release 17 pro-Iranian bombers imprisoned in <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>, the terrorists' main demand. `` This is what we're all waiting for,'' he said plaintively. `` We all want to go home.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> landed at <LOCATION> Larnaca </LOCATION> Friday after a harrowing flight from <LOCATION> Mashhad </LOCATION> in northeast <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. The veteran Iraqi pilot, Capt. <PERSON> Youssef </PERSON> <PERSON> Subhi </PERSON>, 53, frantically radioed he was running out of fuel after he was refused permission to touch down at <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION>. Since then, the <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> hijackers, armed with guns and grenades, have repeatedly demanded that the jumbo jet be refueled. Two captives, their hands tied behind their backs, have been shot in the head and their bodies pushed out of the jet onto the tarmac of the beachside runway. `` The hostages inside the jet must be terrified, wondering who will be next,'' said a Cypriot air traffic controller, one of a team assigned to maintain contact with the hijackers. He asked that his name not be used. `` Every time the hijackers set a new deadline, each passenger must fear that maybe he'll be the one the hijackers pick on when it's not met.'' Passenger <PERSON> Fadel </PERSON> <PERSON> Khaled </PERSON> <PERSON> al-Sabah </PERSON>, a businessman and cousin of <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>'s emir, <PERSON> Shieik </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaber </PERSON> <PERSON> al-Ahmed </PERSON> <PERSON> al-Sabah </PERSON>, could barely talk when the hijackers put him on the radio to plead for fuel. `` We depend on God for our fate,'' he said in a strained voice after reciting a verse from the Koran, Islam's holy book. When he suddenly broke off, the tower asked what was wrong. One of the hijackers snapped back in broken English: `` He is sick. He can not hold his food. He is vomiting.'' The hijackers have reported that several other captives were ailing, but given no details. Two nights ago, one gunman requested Maalox Suspension, an antacid medicine, painstakingly spelling out the name so the tower got it right. He did not say who it was for. One of the four negotiators, who was allowed to step inside the plane once, said he briefly spoke to <PERSON> al-Sabah </PERSON>'s sister, <PERSON> Ebtesam </PERSON>, who with another sister, Anware, are the only women aboard. <PERSON> Ebtesam </PERSON> had blood smeared under her nose. Asked how it got there, the woman said: `` I had a nosebleed. It's because I'm nervous and the air is so dry in here. The 42-year-old flight engineer, <PERSON> Ayed </PERSON> <PERSON> Eid </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamlan </PERSON>, who was hijacked once before in 1984, reported the sky pirates have beaten some of the passengers. Doctors at <LOCATION> Larnaca </LOCATION> morgue reported that both men who were killed had been badly beaten before they were shot by the hijackers, who have threatened to continue a `` slow and quiet massacre'' of their captives. `` The conditions inside the plane must be harrowing by now,'' said the controller, a veteran of several hijacks on this east <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> island that because of its location, only 100 miles from <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, has become a crossroads for terrorists in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>. `` During the day it must be like a Turkish bath.'' The hijackers repeatedly demanded mobile generators to power the air conditioning system and reported Tuesday that the temperature inside the main cabin soared to 104 degrees Fahrenheit when a generator ran out of fuel. `` Hurry up! Hurry up!'' one hijacker snapped to the tower as he waited for a new generator to be rolled up. `` Is is hot in there?'' the tower asked. `` Yes it is,'' the hijacker snarled. `` It's only 30 degrees -LRB- 86 Fahrenheit -RRB- outside.'' The controller noted: `` That's the first time I've heard him display any emotion. Usually they're calm, very matter-of-fact, even when they've just killed a hostage. `` They rarely raise their voices. They seem well-educated and at least one is well-versed technically. They're the coolest customers I've encountered.'' The window shades are drawn 24 hours a day. The hijackers open the doors to haul up plastic bags of food and refreshments when the delivery teams move away. The passengers and flight crew, along with their captors, have eaten little since Friday. They got a hot meal of meat and vegetables Friday night, but since then have had daily deliveries of bread, cakes, cheese, soft drinks and mineral water. Much of the radio chatter is about technical matters or housekeeping _ such as requests to empty the toilets _ that seem trivial as the deadly drama unfolds. But the threat of violence is never far away, despite the air of normality outside as other jets arrive filled with tourists for the beaches across the bay. When a camouflaged C-130 military transport landed Tuesday, one of the hijackers who was fearful it contained troops to storm the jet yelled into the radio: `` We see a military plane! Identify it!'' The controller explained it was a <LOCATION> Greek </LOCATION> air force plane on a routine weekly flight supplying Greek officers with the <ORGANIZATION> Cyprus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION>, and `` nothing to worry about.'' The hijacker said: `` My men were about to shoot at it.''

<HEAD>Spring Fighting Season Starts Despite Accord on Soviet Withdrawal</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Spring thaws have opened the mountain supply routes of Moslem guerrillas and the seasonal surge of fighting in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> has begun despite a U.N.-sponsored accord on Soviet military withdrawal. Leaders of the insurgency, which began after a communist coup in April 1978, were not parties to the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> agreement announced last week and have said repeatedly they would continue the war. Western diplomats said Tuesday there was a sharp increase of military activity in the past two weeks in eastern <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> near <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>. About 3.5 million Afghan refugees live in camps and cities just inside <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> that serve as bases and supply points for the guerrillas. Insurgents overran seven Afghan army posts in <LOCATION> Logar </LOCATION> province in the first week of April and, on Monday, a 450-unit Soviet convoy including more than 100 armored vehicles headed south toward the province from <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>, the diplomats reported. They said the level of fighting appeared normal for early spring. Radio <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> reported that Afghan guerrillas downed a Soviet-built passenger plane near the Soviet border on Sunday, killing all 29 people aboard. Increased fighting also was reported in <LOCATION> Kandahar </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Khost </LOCATION>. The withdrawal agreement is expected to be signed Thursday in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> by the the Afghan government, <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> as guarantors. The guerrillas were not invited to the negotiations and <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> acted as their representative. In <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, an Italian source said <PERSON> Yuli </PERSON> <PERSON> Vorontsov </PERSON>, first deputy foreign minister, told Italian parliamentarians that 50,000 Soviet soldiers will be withdrawn in the first three months after May 15. Soviet soldiers entered <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> in December 1979 and <PERSON> Vorontsov </PERSON>'s reported statement was the first indication <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> officials have given of how many were there. Under the accord to be signed in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>, the Soviets agree to remove all the troops within nine months of May 15, half of them by Aug. 15. Based on the figure given by <PERSON> Vorontsov </PERSON>, the total Soviet force in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> would be about 100,000. Western sources have estimated it at 115,000. Guerrilla leaders have said they would ignore any agreement reached without their direct participation, and contend that the only real parties to the Afghan conflict are themselves and the Soviets. They consider the government in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> _ now led by <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> _ to be a <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> puppet. Diplomatic and other sources reported more fighting in <LOCATION> Kandahar </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s second-largest city, and said wounded government and Soviet soldiers arrived in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> last week. All the sources spoke on condition of anonymity. Insurgents knocked out a government radio station in the city March 25 and later did the same to the television station, diplomats said. They said the radio station had not resumed broadcasting by the first week of April. The sources also reported fighting at <LOCATION> Khost </LOCATION>, the eastern garrison town where Soviet-Afghan forces lifted a guerrilla seige last January after weeks of combat. Diplomats reported a rise in convoy activity and air transport traffic at <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> airport, which they say reflects a redeployment of Soviet soldiers and efforts to build up supplies for the Afghan military before the withdrawal. They reported seeing twin-engine Soviet An-72 aircraft, or possibly An-74s, in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> for the first time last week. The short-takeoff-and-landing planes, which have a fast rate of climb, are less vulnerable than others to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> supplied Stinger anti-aircraft missiles now used by the insurgents. According to the diplomats, the aircraft may be there to help deliver supplies within <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> rather than evacuate Soviet personnel and equipment.

 <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON>'s promise not to accept a convention draft will prove most beneficial to <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' campaign, say prominent Democrats, who believe the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> governor's vow will finally put an end to speculation over a <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> candidacy `` The last holdouts, the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> press corps, may now understand what the rest of the country understands _ the nominee is in the race,'' <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Beckel </PERSON>, a political consultant and onetime adviser to former Vice President <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Mondale </PERSON>, said Monday. <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> said this weekend that Democrats should interpret his earlier statements criticizing any draft efforts to mean he would n't accept a draft for the nomination. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, who is battling <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> for front-runner status and a major share of the 255 delegates at stake in the April 19th <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> primary, is expected to reap the benefits from <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON>'s statement <PERSON> Nathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Landow </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> developer and major <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> fund-raiser said <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON>'s decision `` certainly takes some doubt out of the people's mind who were hoping for an alternative to <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. I think it will unite the party much faster and bring the focus of November into a much earlier view.'' <PERSON> Landow </PERSON>, who is advising <LOCATION> Tennesse </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, said, `` <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> could benefit from this too. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> becomes the clear alternative to <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>.'' The onetime <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> supporter said there will be `` a lot of disappointed Democrats around the country who had a certain glimmer of hope concerning his candidacy.'' Former <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> chairman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON> said he believed <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> from the start when the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> governor said he was not a candidate, but the statement `` clears the air.'' White, an adviser to <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, said `` whatever plus in -LRB- <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON>'s announcement -RRB- has to go to <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. `` Certainly in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, it helps <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> because there was considerable reluctance for party leaders to get committed. It frees them and a good many will go to <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>,'' he said. `` I think that's marginal. I do n't think it's enough to tip the race one way or another.'' One possible delegate, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Koch </PERSON>, responded to <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON>'s vow with the announcement that he would soon endorse either <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> or <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>. <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> had been preparing to lead a draft-Cuomo move at the national convention. And former <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Ottinger </PERSON>, a leader of the draft-Cuomo movement, said he was suspending his effort. `` A large number of the uncommitted, a disproportionate share of those people, felt that <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> should run for president,'' said <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Miringoff </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Marist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Opinion </ORGANIZATION>. `` A larger number of those were people who had indicated -LRB- in previous polling -RRB- they were supporting <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>.'' The most recent <ORGANIZATION> Marist </ORGANIZATION> poll said 8 percent of likely <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> primary voters surveyed said they planned to support a pro-Cuomo uncommitted slate on the ballot next week. While <PERSON> Miringoff </PERSON> said the numbers were n't large, there should be a shift, in light of <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON>'s latest statements, that would create `` a slight enhancement of the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> advantage'' for the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> primary. The latest <ORGANIZATION> Marist </ORGANIZATION> poll, conducted last week, had <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> the choice of 47 percent of the Democrats surveyed. <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> was the choice of 31 percent, and <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> 6 percent. <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> insisted that his ruling out accepting a draft was really nothing more than what he has been saying for more than a year, but he said he felt that he had `` to take extra steps to clarify it ... I'm trying with as much effort as I've ever expended on it to shut it down, so there's absolutely no question, so it does n't get discussed.'' <PERSON> White </PERSON> said the political necessity that forced <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> to make a clarifying statement reflects the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> governor's strength. `` The more he says ` no,' the more we seem to court him and want him,'' <PERSON> White </PERSON> said. `` People are going to go ahead and accept his statement, but there's going to be a lot of talk ... He's kind of like the girl who keeps turning you down.''

<TEXT>
 Thousands of people began arriving this week for the 45th anniversary of the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Jewish Ghetto Uprising, when starving and poorly armed Poles held off the final <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> extermination drive for nearly a month. About 4,500 guests from throughout the world are expected for the April 14-19 observances, including the largest <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> delegation ever to visit <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> severed diplomatic ties with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> after the outbreak of the Middle East War in 1967, when <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> seized the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>. Low-level diplomatic ties resumed in 1986, with the two countries establishing diplomatic section offices in each others' capitals. The observances climax on April 19 with a ceremony at the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Ghetto Fighters' Monument. The monument sits in a plaza in an apartment complex built on the rubble of the former ghetto, which was razed by the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION>. Nazis marched into the ghetto early on April 19, 1943, expecting to organize a rapid deportation and eradication of the last 70,000 inhabitants. But they were met with fierce gunfire from the young warriors of the ghetto's Jewish <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>. The standoff continued until mid-May, when the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION> claimed victory and began deporting the surviving inhabitants to death camps. The anniversary events have been jointly organized by Polish and Israeli committees. Government spokesman <PERSON> Jerzy </PERSON> <PERSON> Urban </PERSON> told reporters Tuesday that <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> will observe the anniversary as an event marking `` tragic <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> and Polish events -LRB- which -RRB- refer to our past, predating the creation of the state of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> conflict.'' He said <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> remains `` in full solidarity with the <LOCATION> Palestinians </LOCATION> -LRB- in the Israeli-occupied territories -RRB- fighting for their human and national rights.'' He called <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s behavior in the territories `` brutal'' and `` an offense to the memory of the defenders of the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Ghetto ... Contradictory to the ideals'' for which they fought. The Israeli visitors include Deputy Prime Minister <PERSON> Itzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Navon </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> member who serves as minister of education and culture, and <PERSON> Abram </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharir </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> member who is minister of justice and tourism. They are the highest-ranked Israeli officials ever to visit <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. Although their visits are considered private, `` the whole event has some influence on <LOCATION> Polish-Israeli </LOCATION> relations,'' said an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity. In addition to <PERSON> Navon </PERSON> and <PERSON> Sharir </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> delegation includes six members of parliament and 2,000 Israeli citizens. Other notables taking part in the observance are <PERSON> Edgar </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bronfman </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jewish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>; the Israeli actor <PERSON> Topol </PERSON>; author <PERSON> Jerzy </PERSON> <PERSON> Kosinski </PERSON>; and Nobel Peace Prize laureate <PERSON> Elie </PERSON> <PERSON> Wiesel </PERSON>, who has written extensively about the Holocaust. <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> also expects delegations from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. Activities planned include an international `` March of the Living'' on Thursday from the former <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> concentration camp of <LOCATION> Auschwitz </LOCATION>, in southern <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, to the mass extermination center of <LOCATION> Birkenau </LOCATION> nearby. A two-day historical and scientific conference on the struggle of Poles and Jews under the Nazi occupation begins Thursday in <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION>. On Sunday, Polish television will broadcast an Israeli-organized quiz program for young people on the history of the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> ghetto. About 120 Poles are to be honored as `` Righteous Among Nations'' by the Israeli <ORGANIZATION> Yad </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Vashem </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> for the aid they gave Jews during World War II. On Monday, a newly built monument at <LOCATION> Umschlagplatz </LOCATION>, where Polish Jews were loaded onto trains for the trip to the <LOCATION> Treblinka </LOCATION> death camp, will be dedicated. A group led by the last surviving commander of the uprising, <PERSON> Marek </PERSON> <PERSON> Edelman </PERSON>, plans to hold its own observances on Sunday. The group includes several activists of the outlawed Solidarity trade union federation and prominent cultural figures.

 A <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official testified Tuesday in the cocaine trial of <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON> <PERSON> Rivas </PERSON> that he tried to alert the <ORGANIZATION> Bahamas </ORGANIZATION>' prime minister to illegal activity in the islands, but was only asked the identity of his sources. <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Antippas </PERSON>, former deputy director the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> mission in <LOCATION> Nassau </LOCATION>, said he was removed from his post in 1983 after investigating complaints about the <LOCATION> Bahamian </LOCATION> island of <PERSON> Norman </PERSON>'s Cay. He is now stationed in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. Defense attorneys complained that testimony was going far beyond the original cocaine-smuggling indictment, and said they were planning to ask for a mistrial. `` The errors that have previously been committed will be grossly compounded,'' said defense attorney <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shohat </PERSON>, arguing against allowing <PERSON> Antippas </PERSON>' testimony. `` In clear terms, this is a hydra-headed case,'' said <PERSON> Shohat </PERSON>, who added that much of the testimony in <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON>'s trial has been outside the scope of the indictment, which covers the period of 1978 to 1980. <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON>, 38, and co-defendant <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlton </PERSON> <PERSON> Reed </PERSON>, 57, are on trial on charges they conspired to smuggle some 3.3 tons of cocaine into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> from <PERSON> Norman </PERSON>'s Cay in the <LOCATION> Bahamas </LOCATION>. `` This indictment has been stressed and mangled so much that is unrecognizable,'' said <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Quinon </PERSON>, another defense attorney. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Merkle </PERSON>, the chief prosecutor in the case, however, argued that <PERSON> Shohat </PERSON> was incorrect. `` Mr. <PERSON> Shohat </PERSON> can shout from now to the cows come home ... but it is not going to make the sun come up in the west,'' said <PERSON> Merkle </PERSON>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Howell </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Melton </PERSON> allowed <PERSON> Antippas </PERSON> to testify, but limited hearsay testimony. <PERSON> Antippas </PERSON> testified he met with <LOCATION> Bahamian </LOCATION> Prime Minister <PERSON> Lynden </PERSON> <PERSON> O. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pindling </PERSON> in 1981 to discuss written complaints he had received from Americans living on <PERSON> Norman </PERSON>'s Cay. `` I raised this with the prime minister and he said he knew of no such complaints and problems on the island. He asked me who these people were and I declined to tell him,'' said <PERSON> Antippas </PERSON>. He said he also complained to <PERSON> Clement </PERSON> <PERSON> Maynard </PERSON>, home affairs minister in the <LOCATION> Bahamas </LOCATION>, and asked that police be stationed on the island to protect Americans and their property. <PERSON> Maynard </PERSON> agreed. In January 1982, <PERSON> Antippas </PERSON> said, he went to the island and found that police there had no vehicles and were apparently doing nothing. He returned in April 1983 and found the island nearly deserted. He also collected telephone toll records and ledgers from the island and placed them in the embassy vault in <LOCATION> Nassau </LOCATION>. In December 1982, a new ambassador was appointed for the <LOCATION> Bahamas </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Lev </PERSON> <PERSON> Dobriansky </PERSON>, and six months later, <PERSON> Antippas </PERSON> said, the governor told him to find another job. The items he had stored in the vault could n't be found, he said. <PERSON> Gorman </PERSON> <PERSON> Bannister </PERSON>, in earlier testimony, had said his father, <LOCATION> Nassau </LOCATION> businessman <PERSON> Everette </PERSON> <PERSON> Bannister </PERSON>, a close associate of <PERSON> Pindling </PERSON>, had complained that <PERSON> Antippas </PERSON> was a thorn in his side and vowed to have him removed. <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON> is charged with conspiracy, possession of cocaine with intent to distribute, importation of cocaine and operating a continuing criminal enterprise. <PERSON> Reed </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pedro </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, is charged with only being a member of the smuggling conspiracy.

<TEXT>
 A new type of laboratory mouse broke legal ground Tuesday as the federal government granted <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> the first <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> patent on an animal. `` A few minutes ago we issued a patent which, for the first time in the history of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Patent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trademark </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>, covers an animal,'' Patent Commissioner <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Quigg </PERSON> announced shortly after noon. `` This particular animal -LRB- is -RRB- a mouse which has been genetically engineered so as to make it more susceptible to'' cancer, <PERSON> Quigg </PERSON> said. The patent, No. 4,736,866, named <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Leder </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Chestnut </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON> of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> as inventors of the mouse, which is to be used for research into cancer. Patents on forms of life are not new, with both plants and types of bacteria having been patented in the past. Almost any type of animal _ except humans _ could be considered for a patent, <PERSON> Quigg </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> Patent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> said last year that it was considering patents on animals, following an appellate court ruling in a case involving a new type of oyster. That ruling said that the agency could go beyond the plants and bacteria, to which it had previously limited patents on life forms. The oyster patent was never issued, however, with examiners concluding that the process was not original enough. The only other animal case occurred in 1974, when the <ORGANIZATION> Patent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> refused to patent a dwarf chicken. The question of patenting animals has raised some controversy in recent years, however, with opponents questioning the ethics of changing animals. Bills have been introduced in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to place a moratorium on such patents until the ethical problems can be worked out, and <PERSON> Quigg </PERSON> said that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the scientific laboratory are the proper forum for such debates. The patent application for the mouse, which had been pending since June 22, 1984, met the legal requirements for a patent, and so one was issued, he said. There are 21 more animal patent applications pending for the agency, <PERSON> Quigg </PERSON> added. Federal law requires that the subject of applications be kept secret until a patent is issued, he said. However, <PERSON> Quigg </PERSON> said further animal patents are not expected to issue for `` some months.'' According to the mouse patent, a cancer-susceptible gene is introduced to the mouse embryo when it is first formed, at the stage of one or two cells. The genetic material used to change the mice is spliced together from an activated version of the mouse cancer gene and a virus that causes mammary tumors in mice, explained <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Lillian </PERSON> <PERSON> Blacker </PERSON>. Having mice that are more sensitive to cancer can be a major benefit for researchers, <PERSON> Quigg </PERSON> said. Currently, mice are often exposed to massive doses of chemicals to see if cancer results. The altered mice could be exposed to chemical levels more like those encountered by humans, perhaps making the experiments more easily related to human dangers, <PERSON> Quigg </PERSON> said. The mice have been used in research since 1984 at <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Blacker </PERSON> said, with the introduced traits remaining true through several generations. The sensitive mice can be used both to test the causes of cancer and cancer-fighting agents, <PERSON> Blacker </PERSON> and <PERSON> Quigg </PERSON> both said. The Patent Office announcement drew prompt reaction on both sides of the issue. <PERSON> Jeremy </PERSON> <PERSON> Rifkin </PERSON> of the Foundation on Economic Trends termed the action an `` arrogant abuse of power'' by the Patent Office. <PERSON> Rifkin </PERSON>, who has opposed genetic engineering, said a coalition of groups will seek to get <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to overturn the action. <PERSON> Rifkin </PERSON> also raised the possibility that an engineered mouse could escape and breed with wild mice, perhaps posing a danger to the environment. But the <ORGANIZATION> Industrial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Biotechnology </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> hailed the action for providing researchers a new tool for cancer research. Legally, a patent holder has the right to exclusive use of an invention for 17 years. In practice, most patent holders license their developments to others, collecting a fee. The idea is to encourage invention by protecting the rights of individuals who produce something new.

 A 22-year-old former <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> cook was sentenced to death Tuesday by a court-martial panel for raping and murdering two women. Ronald A. <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> already had been sentenced to eight life terms in a separate civilian case after he confessed raping and killing the two women. The six-member court-martial panel returned its unanimous verdict after about two hours of deliberations. The panel also reduced Gray from Spec. 4 to private, forfeited all his pay and ordered him dishonorably discharged from the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>. Under the armed forces' Uniform Code of <ORGANIZATION> Military </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> gets an automatic appeal. <PERSON> Gray </PERSON>, a former cook with the 3rd Battalion, 504th Parachute Infantry Regiment of the 82nd Airborne Division, was convicted last week of 14 counts of rape, robbery, murder and attempted murder. <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> lawyers said earlier in the week that the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>'s prescribed form of execution now is lethal injection. In the civilian case, tried in <ORGANIZATION> Cumberland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, he must serve at least 60 years before being eligible for parole. In the court-martial, <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> was convicted of raping and killing <PERSON> Kimberly </PERSON> <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruggles </PERSON>, 24, a civilian cab driver, on Jan. 6, 1987, and <PERSON> Laura </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Vickery </PERSON> <PERSON> Clay </PERSON>, an Army private, on Dec. 15, 1986.

 <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> used give-and-take over the family dinner table to prod his children to excel and he read a Bible story to them nightly, his daughter <PERSON> Kathleen </PERSON> <PERSON> Townsend </PERSON> recalls as the 20th anniversary of <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>'s murder nears. Now 36 and practicing environmental law, Mrs. <PERSON> Townsend </PERSON> said in an interview in the current <PERSON> McCall </PERSON>'s magazine that she preferred not to talk about <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>'s death on June 6, 1968, while running for the Democratic nomination for president. `` I want to remember the happy times, the vibrancy of his presence,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Townsend </PERSON>, who lives in the <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION> suburb of <LOCATION> Ruxton </LOCATION> with her literature-professor husband, <PERSON> David </PERSON>, and three daughters. She said her father's arrival home always touched off tickling and roughhousing and later everybody in the big family, except for the very youngest, had dinner together. `` Those mealtimes were school away from school, but we loved them,'' she said. `` My father would toss questions at us about history. ... If we knew the answers we'd yell them out as though we were winning a big jackpot in a quiz show. And if we drew blanks, my father would say quietly, ` You can do better than that.' That made us want to do better.'' She remembered his telling the children, `` Take the hard course, not the easy way. Make the tough decisions.'' She said that around 8:30 p.m. all the children left their bedrooms at <LOCATION> Kennedy </LOCATION>'s call and sat on the floor at the top of the stairs. `` Before the cross that hung there, my father would read Bible stories, one each night, from a children's version of the Old Testament. And we'd sit in total silence, which was unusual for us, entranced. ... `` I never forgot those evenings. Now we read the same Bible stories every night to our children, who are just as enchanted by them as we were.''

<HEAD>Northeastern States Have Most Vital Economies, Research Group Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Northeastern states with high levels of public spending have the most vital economies while `` low wage, low tax'' states in the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION><LOCATION> , </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plains </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Mountain </LOCATION> regions have the worst, a private research organization said Tuesday. <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corporation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enterprise </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION>, seeking to counter business climate studies that give high marks to states with the least government spending, released an economic report card that listed six states as leaders in the economic competition between the states. All but one border on or include parts of the <LOCATION> Washington-Boston </LOCATION> urban corridor. `` The <LOCATION> Northeast </LOCATION> is where today's economic action is,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Friedman </PERSON>, president of the non-profit research group. Getting grades of A or B in each of four areas _ economic performance, business vitality, economic capacity and policy strength _ were <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Friedman </PERSON> said those states have in common `` a long-standing commitment to public investments.'' States should not compete with Third World countries for industries whose prime concern is cost, <PERSON> Friedman </PERSON> argued. `` In today's economy, we will compete not just by making more of something cheaper, but by making it better or differently.'' <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION> are new on the honor roll, which was released for the first time last year. <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, which made it into the top group last year, slipped. <PERSON> Friedman </PERSON> said that was largely because the 1988 report more heavily weights the gap between rich and poor in those states. The next group of states, which did well overall in the 1988 ranking and which <PERSON> Friedman </PERSON> called `` the contenders,'' were: <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>. States getting mostly Ds and Fs this year were <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> and the Southern states of <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, which had ranked near the bottom in 1987, moved out of the lowest group of states. The report cautioned that the rankings are relative and that a state's movement may not be due to any change within the state but could be caused by improvement or deterioration in other states. The economic performance grade includes job growth, pay levels, the poverty rate, the crime rate, environmental quality and infant mortality. Business vitality refers to the competitiveness and diversity of current business and a state's ability to spawn new businesses. Economic capacity covers a state's financial resources, its infrastructure such as roads and bridges and the education level of its workforce. Policy strength measures the effectiveness of government regulation, education spending and support for research. The $ 200,000 study was paid for by grants: 38 percent from private foundations, 32 percent from businesses and 30 percent from labor unions, <PERSON> Friedman </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Grant </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornton </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> accounting firm which compiles one of the most well-known business climate indexes, has noted the union funding and has criticized the <ORGANIZATION> Corporation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enterprise </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> for being too subjective. It says its own rankings, which assign greater weight to cost factors, reflect the priorities of manufacturing firms.

<HEAD>35 Jews Seeking to Emigrate Reported Arrested at Demonstration</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Police arrested 35 Jews on Tuesday after a demonstration in central <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> in which the asked authorities to explain why they have n't been allowed to emigrate, a Jewish activist said. <PERSON> Bella </PERSON> <PERSON> Gulko </PERSON> said she and 45 other refuseniks _ those who have been denied permission to emigrate _ went to the reception office of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> seeking promised explanations on why they have been unable to obtain exit visas. No one would receive them, she said. The group of refuseniks had alerted the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> on Monday of their plan to visit, citing a pledge given them by party and government officials at a March 1 meeting that they would be given a reply within 40 days, she said. When the refuseniks were denied a meeting with officials, they went across the street from the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> building and stood there, some holding placards demanding exit visas, said Ms. <PERSON> Gulko </PERSON>, 48, who has been seeking for nine years to emigrate. Three buses then pulled up to the group, and 35 were arrested, she said. `` The police treated us roughly, ripping up our signs and pulling us and twisting us by the arms,'' Ms. <PERSON> Gulko </PERSON> said. None of the demonstrators was injured, she said. The Jews were taken to two police stations, where some were held for more than five hours, she said. A police complaint was filed against the refuseniks accusing them of holding an illegal demonstration, she said. Two of the protesters were fined the equivalent of $ 16 by a <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> neighborhood court. The others requested legal representation, and were told they would go on trial later, she said. New regulations that went into effect last year require Soviet authorities to tell applicants for emigration why their request has been rejected. Jewish activists, however, say the rules are ignored or that overly general reasons are given that do n't tell applicants for an exit visa exactly why their request has been refused. Ms. <PERSON> Gulko </PERSON> formerly was employed as an engineer specializing in ventilation and air conditioning systems. She said she has never been given a specific reason for why she has been unable to get an exit visa. She also said she never engaged in secret work for the government, which Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> has said is the sole legitimate reason that can cause rejection of an application to leave the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. Last year, as relations between the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and the West improved, more than 8,000 Soviet Jews were permitted to emigrate, nearly eight times as many as the year before and the highest total since 1981. Among those who have left in recent months are longtime Jewish activists and refuseniks <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> Begun </PERSON>, <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> Slepak </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ida </PERSON> <PERSON> Nudel </PERSON>. Jewish activists say thousands, if not tens of thousands, of Jews want to emigrate but have been turned down.

 City planners thought they had the perfect solution when a developer sought to build homes next to a marsh where endangered species of mice and birds live: Ban all cats from the homes. But that was before the cat lovers began phoning, and one city council member says he'll bring up the issue at next Monday's council meeting `` It's unconstitutional,'' said City Councilman <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Frugoli </PERSON>. `` We'll be the laughingstock of everybody.'' `` It's ridiculous that the city's trying to restrict people from having animals ...,'' he said. `` How do we enforce it? Are we going to have police officers out there checking to see if they have cats?'' But it's not so ridiculous, countered City Planning Director <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>, who said the city imposed the ban at the suggestion of the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Fish and <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. The homes are to be built near swampy grasslands by <LOCATION> Gallinas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Creek </LOCATION> in this suburb about 20 miles north of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. The swampland is home to the salt marsh harvest mouse and the clapper rail bird, both of which are on state and federal endangered species lists. Permits for the 224-home development were issued March 29 after the city <ORGANIZATION> Planning </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> approved construction on condition that felines be banned. `` There's definitely a logic to this,'' Ms. <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> said. `` This is the mouse that has stopped development all over <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> when it is found in an area where development is proposed.'' <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Royce </PERSON>, chief of subdivisions in the <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Real </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Estate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, said the cat ban could be the first in the nation to affect private homes. `` I do n't know of a similar proposal,'' he said. The developer, Southwest Diversified, had no problems with the ban. It's a `` reasonable compromise'' between the environment and the need for housing, said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Garlinghouse </PERSON>, senior vice president of <ORGANIZATION> Southwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Diversified </ORGANIZATION>. `` Twenty years ago we would have simply gone in and bulldozed.'' The executive said he has agreed that a section of land that lies between the housing project and the marsh will remain wild, as sort of a buffer zone. Ms. <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>, who acknowledges getting some irate phone calls from cat lovers, praised the developer for `` being very sensitive to the environmental situation. It was not an issue with the developer. They said ` fine.''' <PERSON> Gail </PERSON> <PERSON> Kobetich </PERSON>, field supervisor of the federal wildlife service's <LOCATION> Sacramento </LOCATION> endangered species office, said that cats `` are one of our major concerns. They're predators.'' Negotiations aimed at saving the endangered mouse are going on over several planned developments on the east and south sides of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Kobetich </PERSON>. `` We generally arrive at a reasonable solution,'' he said.

 A Marine guarding a petroleum storage area near a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military base in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> was shot and killed, apparently by fellow <ORGANIZATION> Marines </ORGANIZATION>, while investigating an alleged intrusion by Panamanian forces into the area, a <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> official said today. `` This petroleum tank farm has been the site of a series of intrusions in the recent past, which resulted in increased vigilance and patrol,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Howard </PERSON>. The purpose of the intrusions and the exact identity of the intruders were not clear, he said. The facility stores fuel for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> airplanes and vehicles at nearby <ORGANIZATION> Howard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION>, he said. `` When one has intruders into the base perimeter, who are in uniform and are camouflaged, the assumption that one comes to is that, of course, they are PDF,'' or members of the Panamanian <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Howard </PERSON>. No intruders were apprehended. `` In the confusion of the firing, the intruders all escaped,'' said <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> Col. <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Sconyers </PERSON>, a spokesman at <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Southern Command. The Marine was identified as Cpl. <PERSON> Ricardo </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Villahermosa </PERSON>, 25, of <LOCATION> Santurce </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>. He was part of I Company, 3rd Battalion, 4th Marine Regiment, part of the 6th Marine Expeditionary Brigade and was sent from <LOCATION> Camp </LOCATION> <LOCATION> LeJeune </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> as part of a strengthened security force last week, officials said. <LOCATION> Villahermosa </LOCATION> was struck by at least one shot in the abdomen, and was pronounced dead at <LOCATION> Gorgas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. Attempts to revive the Marine with open-heart massage were unsuccessful. Several major arteries were hit by the bullet and the Marine suffered massive internal bleeding, <PERSON> Sconyers </PERSON> said. Describing the incident as a `` tragic accident,'' <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> told reporters at the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> that it `` occurred after an apparent intrusion by six or eight individuals into the tank farm area.'' `` <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> security forces patrolling the area split up and were in the process of rejoining when a trip flare was set off, sounding like gunfire,'' he said. `` In response, two elements of the patrol fired. Seven rounds were discharged before the on-the-scene commander ordered a ceasefire. Initial indications are that the fatal gunshot wound was not the result of hostile gunfire, but rather the result of a crossfire from the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> shots fired,'' he said. `` Details of the incident are sketchy at this time,'' he said, and the matter is under investigation. In another accident, two <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> UH-60A Blackhawk helicopters carrying a total of eight soldiers collided during a night training exercise at an airstrip at <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sherman </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> said. `` The soldiers were conducting routine training involving familiarization with night-vision devices immediately prior to the crash,'' at about 10:45 p.m. EDT Monday night, said the spokesman. The soldiers, assigned to the <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Battalion </ORGANIZATION>, 228 <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regiment </ORGANIZATION>, in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, were treated for minor injuries, he said. The accident came just over a month after two UH-60 helicopters collided during a night training mission and crashed 250 feet to the ground, killing 17 servicemen near <ORGANIZATION> Fort </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Campbell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> Air Field in <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>. The Blackhawk is one of the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>'s newest helicopters, but has been grounded several times. Last summer, officials said that about 40 people had been killed in crashes of the helicopter since 1978.

 <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> traded barbs in a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> debate Tuesday on the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, welfare cuts and timidity in dealing with fellow Democrat <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. Republican <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he `` ca n't wait to take on'' one of them in the fall campaign. A week before the pivotal <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> primary, the Democratic battle was turning into `` a bloodletting,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, as he moved sedately toward the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> nomination that is all but his. `` We're warming up for the fall race,'' the vice president said before tossing out the first ball for a <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mets-Montreal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Expos </ORGANIZATION> game at Shea Stadium. `` I still intend to campaign right through the end of the primary season,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Schenectady </LOCATION>. `` I ca n't wait to take on whichever one of those three Democrats wins the Democratic nomination.'' The balloting in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> next Tuesday is a foregone conclusion for the Republicans. But for the Democrats, the primary offers rich prizes and harsh judgments. For <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, it offers another chance to prove he can attract white votes and continue the growth of a mainstream campaign. `` I was an underdog for 45 years and 11 months, and now I'm one of the top dogs, and I just love it,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said in the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> debate. `` <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> loves a winner, and I'm a winner. ... Vote for a winner. Vote for <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> action.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, the front-runner in the polls, is hoping to make it three primary victories in a row and stretch out his delegate lead with the lion's share of the 255 <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> delegates at stake. On Tuesday in the AP delegate count, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has 750.15 votes; <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, 713.1; <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>, 396.8 and uncommitted, 506.7. In search of the 2,082 votes needed to win the nomination at the Democratic National Convention in July, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said he was seeking delegates who supported candidates who have dropped out and even `` maybe for <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>'s delegates.'' `` Do n't lick your chops too soon, Gov. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> fired back in the debate. `` <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s going to have a bigger say about that than you will.'' <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>, trailing badly in the polls, must do well in the April 19 primary just to keep his campaign alive. As he has in past debates, the <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> senator landed the first punches in the confrontation, one of several scheduled before Tuesday's balloting. Hitting on the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> _ a key issue in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> _ <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> had sounded a note of `` enthusiasm'' about an independent Palestinian state and he said he disagreed `` with the way <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> advocates a Palestinian state.'' `` That's not a personal attack,'' <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> concluded. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> retorted that <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> was just wrong. `` I did n't express enthusiasm for a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> state yesterday,'' he said. For his part, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> did not back down from his support for a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> homeland: `` While we can guarantee secure borders, we can not insure tranquility so long as there is occupation.'' Then the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor brought up <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>'s attacks on him a week ago. `` I think we can disagree without suggesting anyone is attacking anyone,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. `` And <PERSON> Al </PERSON>, I think I heard you correctly when you were attacking me for not attacking <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON>. That's the first time that's happened in 25 years.'' With <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> watching the exchange, <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> retorted: `` What I said was you were timid in not being willing to say why you believed you would make a better president than <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> would not let <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> have the last word: `` No, you said I was timid because I would not attack this man. First time that's happened. Earlier this month, <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> attacked <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> for being `` absolutely timid'' in his comments about <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was `` afraid to say a single word about <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>.'' On welfare, <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> recently recommended `` very, very deep cuts'' in aid to welfare recipients in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>. `` You're wrong You're wrong,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. The <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor proposed a 5.5 percent increase in state spending next year for Aid to Families with Dependent Children, only enough to keep up with inflation. Without a serious opponent for the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> nomination, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaigned across <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, saying he was `` running against the ghost of <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>'' and saying there is little difference between the 1988 Democratic contenders. `` Do you want Americans to go back to those terrible days of malaise and darkness?'' he asked in a speech at a <LOCATION> Syracuse </LOCATION> shopping mall. `` That's exactly what we'd have if we ended up electing one of them,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told reporters. Pressed by reporters as to why he was attacking <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> _ who has been out of office for more than seven years _ <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> replied: `` Because the policies of the Democrats will take us right back to the high interest rates and the double-digit inflation of the Carter years.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also made a pitch for black voters, saying the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> offers `` more hope than some of those age-old Democratic answers that have failed. A lot of blacks have voted the straight lever, voted automatically for Democrats and what's it gotten them? Taken for granted over and over again.''

<HEAD>U.S. Calls for Multinational Effort To Resettle Afghan Refugees</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HENRYGOTTLIEB</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration urged the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday to organize a multinational drive to help millions of Afghan refugees `` return in safety and honor'' when Soviet troops withdraw. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is prepared to aid the effort, but `` the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> and its specialized agencies are the logical organizations to coordinate the job,'' <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said. More than 5 million Afghans have fled to neighboring countries, mostly <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, during the eight-year war that has pitted the Afghan government and Soviet troops against U.S.-backed guerrilla forces. Now that Soviet forces are to leave the country by early next year, under an agreement to be signed in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> on Thursday, the return of the displaced <LOCATION> Afghan </LOCATION> population is emerging as one of the next difficult regional issues to be settled. Adding to the difficulty is the likelihood of continued fighting after the departure of Soviet troops, because both superpowers have reserved the right to keep aiding the warring factions. <PERSON> Redman </PERSON>, referring to further settlement talks led by <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> mediator <PERSON> Diego </PERSON> <PERSON> Cordovez </PERSON>, said `` a constructive effort is taking place to work out an interim government and to help the refugees return in safety and honor.'' He said there was no timetable for the return of the refugees and added: `` This process has to be done in such a way that it's done securely, that these people are taken care of. There is obviously going to be some social disorganization inside <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> as this proceeds. We need to try to do this in a coordinated way.'' <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, though which much of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid to the Afghan resistance has been funneled, is especially eager for the return of the refugees from border regions that have been made unstable by the war. <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said they hoped for the earliest possible return of the refugees but were concerned about the impact further fighting in the country would have on resettlement. They also said the withdrawal of Soviet forces from the country could touch off a massive desire among the refugees to trek home. `` The likelihood of continued violence does not frighten the Afghan people,'' one official said. `` What made them flee in the first place was not violence, it was the magnitude of the violence, namely attacks from the Soviet air force, napalm attacks, helicopter raids on villages.'' `` When that ends they will want to return,'' the official said. Under the Afghan accords, the Soviets will withdraw their troops by Feb. 15, 1989, the refugees will return, and <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> will become an independent, non-aligned nation. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> have agreed between themselves, nevertheless, to continue aiding their clients in the country. <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said that agreement has been clarified in private communications between Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> and will be reinforced in statements by the two when they attend the signing ceremony in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>. Some <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> conservatives, led by Sen. <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.H. </LOCATION>, have said they are concerned nonetheless that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> acceptance of the Afghan accord is a signal of flagging <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration support for the resistance forces. A group of conservatives met the president Tuesday to express those concerns. `` We think the administration is well intentioned, but we question the results,'' <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Weyrich </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Free </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>, told reporters after the meeting. <PERSON> Weyrich </PERSON> said the conservatives told <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> that <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> `` is going to have a very difficult time'' helping supply any new aid, because the accord calls for non-interference by <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, as well as the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> reminded the group that he had received personal assurances from Pakistani President <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> <PERSON> ul-Haq </PERSON> `` of their willingness to take the heat and the willingness to continue supplying'' the resistance forces, <PERSON> Weyrich </PERSON> said. `` The president told us repeatedly and in very definitive terms that he is going to stand by the Afghan freedom fighters no matter what,'' <PERSON> Weyrich </PERSON> said.

 <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> announced today he will not run for the leadership post next year and will, instead, seek the chairmanship of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appropriations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> if he is re-elected to a sixth term and the Democrats retain control of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON>, D-W. <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, announced his intentions at a private meeting of <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Democrats and in a two-way satellite hook-up between <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Virginia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> in The decision of <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON>, who has been either the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>'s majority or minority leader for the last 12 years, opens up a race for the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>'s most powerful and influential post among the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>'s 54 Democrats, assuming <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> control remains in their hands. <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> said that as appropriations committee chairman, he would have an opportunity to help his state, which he said has suffered under the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration's economic policies. `` Now, for the first time, I have a new opportunity to have a more direct influence on the allocation of our nation's scarce fiscal resources,'' <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> said. `` At this point in time, I believe I can best serve the people of my state by becoming chairman of the appropriations committee,'' he said. Since the Democrats reclaimed control of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> in 1986 and <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> reclaimed the title of majority leader, it had been rumored that he would step down at the end of this term. He said earlier that the appropriations chairmanship would put him `` in a better position to constantly see something that might be put into <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> and to influence it going there.'' Several political leaders in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> had urged <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> this week to choose the powerful appropriations chairmanship, saying he could do more for the state there than he could as majority leader. Three senators who are the leaders in the race to succeed <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> _ <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Inouye </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>, <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnston </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> and <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> _ all confirmed that they are actively campaigning for the job, and several members said there was no clear front-runner. `` This is Senator <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON>'s day,'' said <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>. `` The emphasis ought to be on his contribution.'' Asked whether he was seeking the top job, <PERSON> Inouye </PERSON> said, `` Yes, I will.'' As to whether he had the votes to win, the senator said: `` They look good.'' <PERSON> Inouye </PERSON> said he did not believe any residual criticism of his performance as chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Iran-Contra investigating panel last summer would be a problem to his bid. <PERSON> Johnston </PERSON> said <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> had announced his retirement from the majority leader post in `` a very eloquent statement'' which received sustained applause from party members. Asked whether he believed he had the votes, <PERSON> Johnston </PERSON> said: `` I hope to have them. I do not now. No one does. I just became a candidate.'' One who had been thought a possible candidate, Sen. <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> Bumpers </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ark </LOCATION>., said he would not make the race `` I'm one of 54 who's not running,'' he said. <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> will elect their leader late this year, following the November elections that will determine whether they retain control of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. Sen. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Lautenberg </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.J. </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON>'s retirement as Democratic leader `` portends a new era.'' <PERSON> Lautenberg </PERSON> called <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON>, who has been known for his mastery of <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> rules but somewhat dry leadership style, `` a very effective leader'' but said he did not necessarily think a successor will follow in the same vein. `` What we'll be looking for in the leader is perhaps someone with less knowledge of the process, but hopefully able to do it differently ... the time for change I think is appropriate.'' <PERSON> Lautenberg </PERSON> said he did not believe seniority would be the key factor in the leadership race. Sen. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, D-Mass., said `` I have all the respect for Senator <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> over the period of time he has served as majority leader and minority leader He made this judgment for the best interests of the nation and the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>.'' <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> will be 71 on Nov. 20. He came to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> 30 years ago and cultivated a reputation as a master at the legislative game, a courtly strategist who gained power by attending to his colleagues' smallest wishes In 1971, <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> called in his favors and orchestrated a major coup by ousting <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> for the No. 2 party post of assistant leader, or majority whip. He was a loyal aide to Majority Leader <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Mansfield </PERSON>, and was easily elected to succeed him in 1976.

 Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> neglected to tell an <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agent investigating the <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> scandal of discussions about filling a key <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> post with <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s longtime friend, <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> consultant <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON>, the attorney general's lawyer said Tuesday. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> was interviewed in the <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> probe by the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> on April 17, 1987, just over a week after being informed that <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> was under criminal investigation in the matter. A week or so before being notified of <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON>'s status, <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> had asked <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> whether he was interested in becoming counselor to <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> at the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> lawyer <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Rocap </PERSON> said that an <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agent on April 17 asked <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> a question that `` was broad enough to elicit the counselor job.'' But <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> at the time was `` focusing on an earlier period'' and perceived the question to relate to whether <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> considered taking a job during <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s early tenure as attorney general in 1985. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> thought about the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> interview over the weekend and the following week, on his own initiative, informed the agent of the counselor job discussions. `` He did n't make a conscious decision during the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> interview to withhold the information,'' said <PERSON> Rocap </PERSON>. When he talked to the agent a second time, <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> also informed the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> that he and <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> had discussed possibly creating an advisory commission in 1986 on which <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> would serve to examine the administration of the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and to suggest possible changes. The commission was never formed. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> wanted <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> to join the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> last spring, despite the growing <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> scandal that eventually led to <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON>'s indictment on racketeering charges. The attorney general knew at the time that <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> was a witness in the <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> case, said <PERSON> Rocap </PERSON>. But it was n't until April 8, 1987 that the attorney general was notified formally under an administrative mechanism involving the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> that <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> was a subject of the criminal investigation into <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Rudolph </PERSON> <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> interview of <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> was part of <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON>'s probe. <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> was indicted on racketeering charges in the <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> scandal last December. He has pleaded innocent.

<HEAD>BLM Considering Halting Large-Scale Giveaways of Wild Horses</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Land </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday it is going to decide whether recent allegations of cruelty to animals should mean an end to its practice of giving away large numbers of wild horses. `` We're putting the large-scale adoptions under an intensive review,'' <ORGANIZATION> BLM </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> Locke </PERSON> said. But he declined to confirm a report that the no-fee, large-herd `` adoption'' program had been suspended. Since the mid-1970s, the bureau has offered for `` adoption'' the wild horses taken in its roundups from the Western range on payment of $ 125. Use of the term `` adoption'' is really a marketing tool, since after a year the bureau gives the `` foster parent'' title to the horse. Since 1984 the bureau has waived the fee for people willing to take 100 animals or more. <PERSON> Locke </PERSON> said the review was prompted by recent allegations of abuse, including one at <LOCATION> Sheyenne </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.D. </LOCATION>, where earlier this month bureau officials reclaimed what was left of a herd of 400 horses on a ranch there. Forty-two horses were missing and 87 had died, mostly of dehydration or starvation. The Grand Forks -LRB- <LOCATION> N.D. </LOCATION> -RRB- <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION> last week quoted <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Boyles </PERSON>, head of the bureau's wild horse and burro division, as saying, `` We're not approving any more than those already approved. Both <PERSON> Boyles </PERSON> and <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Burford </PERSON>, director of the bureau, were traveling Tuesday and unavailable for comment. <PERSON> Locke </PERSON> would say only, `` The instruction memo has not been issued. Large-scale adoptions are still in our regs.'' <PERSON> Locke </PERSON> said <PERSON> Burford </PERSON> would take up the question when he returns. Last year the bureau transferred 8,600 horses to private caretakers in large-herd, no-fee adoptions. These are generally horses that no one has taken in individual adoptions, and frequently undesirable because older horses are more difficult to break. About 5,000 horses a year are adopted by individuals. The bureau has to round up horses to keep them from eating so much forage that cattle can not graze on the range. It previously killed the surplus animals, but it abandoned that practice in 1982 following protests by animal rights groups.

 Former Democratic presidential nominee <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> McGovern </PERSON> told Jewish voters in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> on Tuesday that <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> is neither anti-Semitic nor anti-Israel and should not be judged `` on the indiscretions of an earlier time.'' `` It is not worthy of the great traditions of Judaism for its adherents to been seen as unforgiving toward a black man who is extending the hand of reconciliation and peace,'' <PERSON> McGovern </PERSON> said in a statement. As the 1972 Democratic presidential nominee called for peace-making, however, leaders of two major Jewish groups slammed <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s campaign manager for saying they wanted to meet with <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> simply to harass him. The statement by <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> aide <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Austin </PERSON> is `` false, unfortunate and offensive,'' said <PERSON> Malcolm </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoenlein </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Presidents </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Major </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jewish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organizations </ORGANIZATION>. `` In view of his theme of healing, we are dismayed that the <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> campaign seems to have made a decision not to meet with the leadership of the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Jewish community,'' said <PERSON> Lester </PERSON> <PERSON> Pollack </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Jewish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION>, even as the invitation to speak was issued again. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> alone among the three remaining major <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> candidates has not accepted the invitation of the two groups to speak before the April 19 <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> primary. Jewish voters usually account for up to one-quarter of the Democratic primary voters in the state. The conference of presidents is made up of 44 national Jewish groups. The council is a coordinating body for 59 Jewish organizations in the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> metropolitan area. <PERSON> McGovern </PERSON> sought to reduce some of the tensions by writing what he called an `` open letter to the Jewish voters of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>.'' He said he is not endorsing <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. `` I have no doubt that <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> is free of anti-Semitism _ a bigotry totally at odds with his years of passionate devotion to civil rights,'' <PERSON> McGovern </PERSON> wrote. `` I do not want to see this steadily improving political leader judged on the indiscretions of an earlier time rather than the more mature conduct he demonstrates today.'' Three items in particular were addressed by <PERSON> McGovern </PERSON>: <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s `` views on the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, his earlier association with the intemperate <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Farrakhan </PERSON> and a slurring reference to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> as ` Hymietown.' `` I fully understand the concerns of Jews on these matters. Indeed, four years ago, I took public issue with <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> because of this,'' <PERSON> McGovern </PERSON> said. During his 1984 campaign, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> referred to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> as ` Hymietown'' and Jews as `` Hymie'' in what he thought was a private conversation. `` With reference to the ` Hymietown' slur, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> has long ago expressed his regrets over this unfortunate language,'' <PERSON> McGovern </PERSON> wrote. `` He also clearly ended his association with <PERSON> Farrakhan </PERSON> some years ago.'' <PERSON> Farrakhan </PERSON>, the leader of the <ORGANIZATION> Nation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Islam </ORGANIZATION>, referred to <ORGANIZATION> Judaism </ORGANIZATION> as a `` gutter religion'' in 1984, when he was a <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> backer. On the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, <PERSON> McGovern </PERSON> said that <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s positions are not extreme, that he can be `` a reconciling force in that hate-ridden region.'' `` If I were a Jew with special concerns for <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, I would not be disturbed by <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s positions,'' <PERSON> McGovern </PERSON> said. The 1972 nominee said that <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s convictions are `` close to those'' of some Israeli leaders. He named <PERSON> Abba </PERSON> <PERSON> Eban </PERSON>, <PERSON> Eser </PERSON> <PERSON> Weisman </PERSON> and <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON> <PERSON> Peres </PERSON>. `` It is true that <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> has met with <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> Leader <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>, favors direct negotiations between <LOCATION> Palestinians </LOCATION> and the Israelis, supports the concept of self-determination for Palestinians and the exchange of Israeli-occupied territory for peace,'' <PERSON> McGovern </PERSON> said. `` These position, with which I agree, do not threaten <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. Quite the contrary, they are essential conditions of justice and a secure peace for Israelis as well as Palestinians.''

<HEAD>Jim Brady, Wife Describe Plight Of Head Injury Victims</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Presidential press secretary <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> and his wife <PERSON> Sarah </PERSON> asked <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday to expand home health care and other services vital to head injury victims, describing vividly their own plight since <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> was shot. `` My name is <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>. I am a seven-year survivor of a traumatic brain injury,'' <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> said evenly as a hush fell over the packed <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> hearing room. `` I know only too well the tragedy surrounding a head injury. I am pleased that you are taking a keen look at our problems.'' <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> was shot during the 1981 assassination attempt on President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and at one point was reported dead. He delivered his brief statement to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee on the handicapped from a wheelchair, with little expression in his face or voice. Though clearly not fully recovered, <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> demonstrated during his wife's testimony that his famous sense of humor survives in some form. `` Speaking as a family member, I can tell you that going through that initial trauma is surely difficult, but somehow you do,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> said. `` It was difficult for me, too,'' <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> interjected dryly, winning a roar of laughter from the audience, which included many head trauma victims. Mrs. <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> said <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> had received first-rate care, even down to a 24-hour <ORGANIZATION> Secret </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> guard by his hospital room door. `` That was so I could n't sneak out,'' <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> interrupted. The rude shock came when <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> was released from the hospital and there was no support network, his wife said. She said she felt trepidation about facing the situation alone and had no one with whom to discuss the best way to handle <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>'s rehabilitation. Under questioning, Mrs. <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> said her family's No. 1 need is for home care for her husband, who can not be left alone during a short shopping trip much less the many hours of a full-time workday. `` Jim for example is not able to get out of a chair by himself, and would not be able to leave our home in the event of a fire,'' she said. `` It's very frustrating to see that home health care is not always covered'' by government or private insurance. Mrs. <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> said families and survivors also need support and counseling programs to cope with the tragedy that has shattered so many lives _ children, parents, spouses and the victims themselves. She said the shooting has had a devastating impact on <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>'s elderly mother and his 9-year-old son As for <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> himself, she said, `` He laughs and keeps a sense of humor up, but I know that he thinks daily of what he could have been doing.''

<HEAD>Christian Democrat to Form Italy's 48th Postwar Cabinet</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Premier-designate <ORGANIZATION> Ciriaco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> De </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mita </ORGANIZATION> received final approval from coalition members Tuesday to form <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>'s 48th post-World War II government and said he would present his Cabinet list to the president. The Christian Democrat leader told reporters, `` All the problems are resolved'' in negotiations to form another five-party government. <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Mita </PERSON>, 60, indicated he would go to the Quirinal Palace on Wednesday to present his list of Cabinet ministers to President <PERSON> Francesco </PERSON> <PERSON> Cossiga </PERSON>, thus formally ending the monthlong government crisis. The coalition is to be made up of the same parties that have governed off and on since 1981: the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION>, Socialists, Social Democrats, Republicans and Liberals. Leaders of the parties gave their final endorsement of <ORGANIZATION> De </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mita </ORGANIZATION>'s plan on Tuesday Crucial support came from the Socialists, the second-largest party in the coalition and a frequent critic of the dominant <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Giovanni </PERSON> <PERSON> Di </PERSON> <PERSON> Michelis </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> representative, said the party will participate in a `` loyal and constructive way.'' But the top Socialist leader, former Premier <PERSON> Bettino </PERSON> <PERSON> Craxi </PERSON>, predicted rough going for the new government. He was asked if <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Mita </PERSON>'s government could last through the end of the legislative term in 1992 and replied, `` It would be a miracle.'' <PERSON> Craxi </PERSON> said the new coalition was based on the same foundation as that led by Premier <PERSON> Giovanni </PERSON> <PERSON> Goria </PERSON>, a Christian Democrat who resigned on March 11 after eight turbulent months in office. <PERSON> Goria </PERSON> said he would not join the new government as a minister. Christian Democrat <PERSON> Giulio </PERSON> <PERSON> Andreotti </PERSON> is expected to remain as foreign minister and <PERSON> Liberal </PERSON> <PERSON> Valerio </PERSON> <PERSON> Zanone </PERSON> as defense minister. After presenting his Cabinet list to <PERSON> Cossiga </PERSON>, <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Mita </PERSON> will seek a confidence vote in <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> where the coalition holds a comfortable majority in both houses. The vote is expected next week. <ORGANIZATION> De </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mita </ORGANIZATION> cleared the final hurdle when the parties agreed on proposed anti-trust legislation for the Italian media. Under the accord, no individual or group can own or control both a newspaper and a television network. If the legislation is passed, private television magnate <PERSON> Silvio </PERSON> <PERSON> Berlusconi </PERSON> will have to give up his <ORGANIZATION> Milan </ORGANIZATION> newspaper <PERSON> Il </PERSON> <PERSON> Giornale </PERSON>, while the <ORGANIZATION> Fiat </ORGANIZATION> automaking company will have to drop plans to expand into television. <ORGANIZATION> Fiat </ORGANIZATION> owns the newspaper <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stampa </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Turin </LOCATION> and controls the <LOCATION> Rizzoli </LOCATION> publishing group that includes the <ORGANIZATION> Corriere </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Della </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sera </ORGANIZATION> newspaper of <LOCATION> Milan </LOCATION> and the sports daily <ORGANIZATION> Gazzetta </ORGANIZATION> dello Sport. The Socialists had sought to gain equal management control of the state-run <ORGANIZATION> RAI </ORGANIZATION> television network, headed by a Christian Democrat, but that was rejected by <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Mita </PERSON>. On the issue of nuclear power, the parties put off a final decision on the fate of the unfinished nuclear plant at <LOCATION> Montalto </LOCATION> di <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> near <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>. The Socialists had insisted the plant be converted to another form of energy production. The Christian Democrats favor completing the nuclear station.

 Viewers tuning in to watch <PERSON> Cher </PERSON> and her eye-popping dress helped the Academy Awards show reverse a ratings decline and rack up its biggest television audience in four years. Fans who stuck out the full three hour, 33-minute telecast Monday night also saw `` The Last Emperor,'' filmed amid the imperial splendor of <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Forbidden </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, sweep all nine awards for which it was nominated. During prime time, from 9-11 p.m. EDT when the networks are competing against each other, the 60th annual Academy Awards show on <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> had a rating of 30.1 and a 47 share. Last year, the show rated 27.5 and a 43 share. The rating is a percentage of the nation's 88.6 million homes with television. The share is a percentage of sets in use. It was the highest-rated Oscars since 1984, when the live <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> extravaganza had a rating of 30.3 and a 50 share. <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> estimated that 80 million viewers saw all or part of this year's show. `` I'm staggered. I do n't know what to say about it,'' Producer <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldwyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> said Tuesday of the ratings. <PERSON> Goldwyn </PERSON> said despite the ratings success, he is bowing out after two years as the Oscar show producer. `` There are a lot more people in this town more talented than I who should try,'' he said. `` I wish the next guy luck.'' <PERSON> Cher </PERSON>'s sheer, sequined <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Mackie-designed </PERSON> dress left little to the imagination when she won the best actress <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> for `` Moonstruck.'' Another best-actress nominee, <PERSON> Sally </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirkland </PERSON>, showed up in a black gown with a deep plunging neckline. The other acting winners were <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON>, best actor for `` Wall Street''; <PERSON> Sean </PERSON> <PERSON> Connery </PERSON>, best supporting actor for `` The Untouchables''; and <PERSON> Olympia </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, best supporting actress for `` Moonstruck.'' `` The Last Emperor,'' writer-director <PERSON> Bernardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Bertolucci </PERSON>'s story of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s boy ruler, won best picture, best director and best adapted screenplay for the Italian director and collaborator <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Peploe </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldwyn </PERSON> said Tuesday he arranged the show's sequences on a hunch `` The Last Emperor'' might sweep the awards. `` I knew the big thing was to program against it -LRB- the sweep -RRB- by giving entertainment for people while watching a rout,'' he said. `` When I saw it get the editing award, I knew that was it.'' Oscar gold may translate into box-office silver for `` The Last Emperor.'' Ticket sales increased last weekend by 49 percent and <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pictures </ORGANIZATION> added 74 screens to the movie's distribution, apparently in anticipation of Oscar victories. The movie so far has earned only $ 25.1 million in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> box office, compared with `` Three Men and A Baby,'' which has earned $ 156.7 million. The Oscar show, directed by <PERSON> Marty </PERSON> <PERSON> Passetta </PERSON>, came in the second month of a strike by the 9,000 members of the <ORGANIZATION> Writers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guild </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>. A writing team led by ex-WGA president <PERSON> Mel </PERSON> <PERSON> Shavelson </PERSON> stopped work on the script and never returned to it after the strike began March 7. The relocation of the Oscars to the cavernous Shrine Auditorium caused logistical problems, including a monumental traffic jam that forced some stars to leave their limousines and walk rather than miss the show. Best actress nominees Meryl Streep and <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> <PERSON> Close </PERSON>, who is nine months pregnant, were spotted hiking up <LOCATION> Jefferson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Boulevard </LOCATION> in their Oscar finery. It was the first Oscar show at the Shrine in 40 years. The site was chosen because of its 6,300-seat auditorium, nearly double the number available in the <LOCATION> Dorothy </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Chandler </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pavilion </LOCATION> where the show has been staged for the past several years. <PERSON> Goldwyn </PERSON> said the bigger audience helped the ambiance of the awards. `` The audience was very warm. The standing ovations were a knockout. We did n't expect that. The audience was much looser than at the <PERSON> Dorothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Chandler </PERSON>.'' The academy confirmed Tuesday that another name should be added to the list of Oscar winners. Set directors <PERSON> Bruno </PERSON> <PERSON> Cesari </PERSON> and <PERSON> Osvaldo </PERSON> <PERSON> Desideri </PERSON> shared as co-winners in set direction for `` The Last Emperor,'' said academy spokeswoman <PERSON> Marci </PERSON> <PERSON> Blaze </PERSON>. <PERSON> Desideri </PERSON>'s name was inadvertently omitted from the original list of nominees.

The Dow Jones industrial average rose 14.09 points to close at 2,110.08, its first close above that level since the market collapsed on Oct. 19. The gain was the sixth consecutive rise for a total rise of nearly 130 points. Early in the session stock prices were mixed and the market appeared to lack direction. But computer-guided `` program trading'' late in the day set off a surge of stock buying that pushed up the market. Such programs seek to profit from price disparities between stock index futures and the stocks mirrored by the indexes. Trading volume remained light, which accentuated the move upward once buyers did step in, analysts noted. Analysts said many investors were sitting on the sidelines awaiting fresh economic data, such as the government's report on the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade deficit for February, which is due Thursday. `` A lot of people are going to play it close to the vest until they see some direction from the numbers coming out,'' said <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Vandenberg </PERSON>, a vice president at <ORGANIZATION> Smith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Barney </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Harris </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Upham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Co.

 Blacks and whites joined in paying tribute to <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Paton </PERSON>, the country's most renowned author and an outspoken advocate of racial justice who died Tuesday at the age of 85. <PERSON> Paton </PERSON>, whose novel `` Cry, The Beloved Country'' became one of the world's best-known depictions of apartheid, died of throat cancer at his estate outside the port city of <LOCATION> Durban </LOCATION> a day after he was released from a hospital to spend his last hours at home. `` He went peacefully, happy to have been in his own bed,'' said his wife, <PERSON> Anne </PERSON>. `` With his passing, an era has ended and our beloved country cries,'' <PERSON> Enos </PERSON> <PERSON> Mabuza </PERSON>, leader of the black homeland of <LOCATION> Kwangane </LOCATION>, said of the white author who was also a prison administrator, commentator, politician and public speaker. `` <PERSON> Paton </PERSON> was the champion of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s oppressed, a visionary who campaigned for peace, for freedom within the rule of law and justice for all,'' he said. `` Cry, the Beloved Country,'' published in 1948, tells the story of a Zulu priest in search of his son, who is being sought by police for the murder of a white man. It has sold 15 million copies in 20 languages and was made into a musical, `` Lost in the Stars,'' by composer <PERSON> Kurt </PERSON> <PERSON> Weill </PERSON> and playwright <PERSON> Maxwell </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>. Only the Bible outsells his book in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. `` I have one great fear in my heart,'' says the main black character at the end of the book. `` One day when they -LRB- the whites -RRB- have turned to loving, they will find we are turned to hating.'' That passage has been quoted often by Anglican Archbishop <PERSON> Desmond </PERSON> <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON>, the prominent anti-apartheid campaigner and Nobel peace laureate. President P.W. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> said of <PERSON> Paton </PERSON>: `` Although he was a noted critic of the government, he was respected for his sincerity, never failing to temper his criticism with a recognition of positive developments and the realities of the situation.'' <PERSON> Paton </PERSON> wrote only four works of fiction but campaigned unrelentingly against apartheid, under which the white minority excludes blacks from national politics and restricts them to segregated neighborhoods, schools and hospitals. <PERSON> Paton </PERSON> vowed to keep silent after the 1968 banning of the multi-racial <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> he helped found, but he began speaking out publicly again in the early 1980s. Prior to his first novel, <PERSON> Paton </PERSON> served for 13 years as principal of Diepkloof Reformatory, a home for 650 delinquent black boys aged 10 to 21 outside <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Paton </PERSON> was 32 when he arrived at Diepkloof to find a prison with high walls, no latrines and a staff that considered its main job to be guard duty. When <PERSON> Paton </PERSON> left Diepkloof in 1948, the barbed wire was gone and it had the lowest escape rate in the country. He became known as `` the man who pulled up the barbed wire and planted geraniums.'' In his later years, <PERSON> Paton </PERSON> was regarded as the elder statesman of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s liberals. Some anti-apartheid groups considered him too conservative, and he was tolerated by <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> supporters who once considered him a traitor for his writings. `` Save the Beloved Country,'' a compilation of some of his articles and speeches, was published in January. `` Journey Continued,'' a sequel to his autobiography, `` Toward The Mountain,'' is due out at the end of April. The sequel focuses on people with whom <PERSON> Paton </PERSON> worked in the early days of the anti-apartheid movement. Mrs. <PERSON> Paton </PERSON> said there would be a private cremation service. She said a public service would be held Saturday in <LOCATION> Pietermaritzburg </LOCATION>, the southeasterm city where <PERSON> Paton </PERSON> was born. Another service will be held next week in <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION>. Besides his wife, survivors include <PERSON> Paton </PERSON>'s two sons from his first marriage and five grandchildren. His first wife, <PERSON> Dorrie </PERSON>, died in 1967.

 Democrat <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaigned in a conservative Jewish community Tuesday, declining to criticize rival <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> despite shouted invitations from some in the crowd. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, seeking Jewish support in next Tuesday's <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> presidential primary, met privately with Jewish leaders in the <LOCATION> Borough </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> neighborhood of <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION> and later spoke to hundreds of Hassidic and orthodox Jews who filled the street outside. It was the second day of meetings with Jewish leaders for the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor, who came to the neighborhood just hours after facing rivals <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> in a locally televised debate. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> earlier had said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has shown `` enthusiasm'' for creation of a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> state in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, something some Jewish leaders oppose. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> denied that during the debate. As <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> took questions from reporters in <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION>, some young Hassidic Jews in the crowd shouted to him asking what he thought about <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> _ who has drawn the ire of some Jews for his positions regarding Palestinians in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and for his 1984 reference to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> as `` Hymietown.'' `` I have some disagreements with Rev. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>; I have some disagreements with Sen. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said to reporters. `` I'm going to run a strong campaign that puts my best foot forward ... in the hope I can win suppport of the people of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> referred to his own heritage as the son of <LOCATION> Greek </LOCATION> immigrants and praised the largely Jewish community as `` a model of what a caring community is all about, a recognition that we're all in this together.'' <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s primary campaign has focused on <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> issues, reflecting the fact that Jews generally make up close to one-quarter of the Democratic primary electorate. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said he also planned to campaign in black and Hispanic communities, and he went from <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION> to a health clinic in a predominantly Hispanic section of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Upper </LOCATION> <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Side </LOCATION>. There he talked of his commitment to basic health insurance and day care, addressing several dozen people, most of them women who work at the clinic and their children. In Borough Park, he was strongly endorsed by the council's leader, Rabbi <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> <PERSON> Schmidman </PERSON>, who said a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> state would be `` a dagger at the heart and soul of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has said a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> state should be a matter of negotiations for <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and its neighbors. Also appearing with him was the area's congressman, Rep. <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Solarz </PERSON>. He praised the work of <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' wife <PERSON> Kitty </PERSON> as a member of a national commission working to honor victims and survivors of the Holocaust, `` of which there are more survivors here in <LOCATION> Borough </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION> than any other city'' in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. The rabbi called <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> `` the best choice'' and said, `` I urge my friends to follow me'' in voting for him. Some in the crowd, however, expressed reservations. <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON>, a Hebrew teacher, said, `` He was very vague in regard to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. ... I find him hazy.'' Several said they liked <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>, who has taken a strongly pro-Israel stance recently, but they voiced concern that votes for <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> would have the effect of enhancing <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s position in the three-way primary. `` There is a fear of <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>,'' said <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON>. A woman from Borough Park who would identify herself only as <PERSON> Rachel </PERSON> said she liked <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> but `` we'd rather have <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> than to give too much power to <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>.''

 A polygamist clan leader bombed a Mormon chapel to bring about a `` final confrontation'' he believed would trigger the downfall of church and state, a federal prosecutor said Tuesday. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Brent </PERSON> <PERSON> Ward </PERSON>'s opening statement began the trial of four clan members facing charges relating to the Jan. 16 chapel bombing and a 13-day standoff that ended Jan. 28 in gunfire that killed a state corrections officer. In addition to opening statements, the first witnesses were called to testify. And <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Jenkins </PERSON> denied a defense motion to move the trial out of <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> for the first time officially identified <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Singer </PERSON> as the clan member authorities believe killed Corrections Lt. <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> House </PERSON> when officers attempted to capture clan leader <PERSON> Addam </PERSON> <PERSON> Swapp </PERSON> and his brother with attack dogs. Singer, 21, son of clan matriarch <PERSON> Vickie </PERSON> <PERSON> Singer </PERSON>, has not been charged in the death. State authorities say they will file murder charges following the federal trial. `` <PERSON> Vickie </PERSON> <PERSON> Singer </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Addam </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Swapp </LOCATION> made it clear there would be no surrender and that the nation, church and state would have to be destroyed first,'' said <PERSON> Ward </PERSON>, who detailed the bombing of the <ORGANIZATION> Kamas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stake </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> and the standoff at the clan's Marion homestead. `` Evidence and witnesses will show the events were part of a pattern of criminal activity having a common purpose,'' <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> said. `` Evidence will show in this case that <PERSON> Addam </PERSON> <PERSON> Swapp </PERSON> was the bomber.'' `` You will hear evidence that this was more than just a bombing _ that it was an invitation to a violent confrontation,'' <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> said. The clan blamed the state and the Mormon church for various problems, including the death nine years ago of Mrs. Singer's husband, <PERSON> John </PERSON>, who was killed in a confrontation with police <PERSON> Swapp </PERSON>, 27, married to two of Mrs. Singer's daughters, is charged with seven counts and Mrs. Singer, 45, eight counts. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Singer </PERSON> and <PERSON> Swapp </PERSON>'s brother, <PERSON> Jonathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Swapp </PERSON>, 21, are charged with attempted murder of federal agents, assault on federal officers and two firearms violations. <PERSON> Swapp </PERSON> and Mrs. Singer face the same counts, plus use of an explosive to damage the chapel and use and possession of a bomb. Mrs. Singer also is charged with possession of a sawed-off shotgun. Using an aerial photograph and a surveyor's diagram, <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> also walked jurors through the sequence of events leading up to the clan's shootout with police. <PERSON> Kathryn </PERSON> <PERSON> Collard </PERSON>, representing Mrs. Singer, said there was no evidence specifically linking her client to the eight charges. `` Mrs. Singer's defense in this case is simple. It is the truth,'' she said. `` There was not anything so much as a threatening gesture from <PERSON> Vickie </PERSON> <PERSON> Singer </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Singer </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Metos </PERSON>, urged the jury to look closely at the attempted murder charge and determine whether his client had the malice and intent to kill. The government, he said, `` must show that <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Singer </PERSON>, or whoever did the shooting at these officers, had the specific intent to cause their death.'' `` Except he will tell you that he had no intention of harming anyone. He just wanted to keep the dogs off his brother-in-law and <PERSON> Jonathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Swapp </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Metos </PERSON> said. Attorneys for the Swapp brothers reserved their opening statements for later. The government called its first two witnesses: a couple who live across the highway from the bombed church building. They testified about hearing the blast and later finding the damage.

<HEAD>TWA Hijack Suspect to Be Tried Before Youth Court</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FRANKFURT, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Officials said Tuesday that a juvenile court will try a Lebanese man charged in a <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> hijacking in which a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> sailor was killed. If convicted in the youth court, <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> would face a maximum 10-year term. He had been scheduled to go on trial next month as an adult and could have drawn a maximum life sentence. In <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> defendants under 21 are tried in youth court. <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON>'s 21st birthday came two days before the hijacking on June 15, 1985, according to the <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> state court. `` However, a possibility exists that the perpetration of the crime that he is accused of may have begun before June 13, 1985, and goes back to the time of his adolescence,'' a court statement said. `` Therefore, the case has been turned over to the youth court,'' it said. <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> was charged in February with murder, hostage-taking and other crimes stemming from the 1985 hijacking of a <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> jetliner to <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> during which <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> diver <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Stethem </PERSON> was killed and 39 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizens were held hostage for 17 days. Moving the case to a youth court means the news media could be barred from <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON>'s trial and proceedings may not begin for months, authorities said. Judicial sources in <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> said they believed <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON>'s trial was not likely to start before the end of the year. `` The Hesse state youth court will now need time to study the case files before it can decide on when <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON>'s trial will start,'' the court statement said. A federal <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman who spoke on condition of anonymity said the youth court could decide to exclude the press from <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON>'s trial. He said the decision would not be made until the trial begins. <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> was arrested at <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> airport on Jan. 13, 1987, carrying liquid explosives and false documents. Last year, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> asked for <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON>'s extradition on air piracy and murder charges. The West German government refused the request after the kidnapping in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> of West Germans <PERSON> Rudolf </PERSON> <PERSON> Cordes </PERSON> and <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Schmidt </PERSON> in January 1987. It said he would be tried in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> instead. Defense attorneys in <LOCATION> Duesseldorf </LOCATION> gave their closing arguments Tuesday in the case of <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON>'s brother, <PERSON> Abbas </PERSON>. <PERSON> Abbas </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> is charged with kidnapping the two West Germans in an attempt to force West German authorities to release his brother. <PERSON> Schmidt </PERSON> was released by his captors in September in what they said was a `` goodwill gesture,'' but <PERSON> Cordes </PERSON> is still being held.

<TEXT>
 The leaders of often-feuding factions in American aviation joined forces Tuesday to fight for more airports and air traffic control support to meet the needs of commercial and private air transportation. `` Unless we modernize the -LRB- air traffic system -RRB- quickly, we'll choke off growth to the detriment of all,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Crandall </PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> <PERSON> Crandall </PERSON> was among five airline chief executives, and leaders of groups representing aircraft manufacturers, business flyers, private and commercial pilots and airport officials who called a news conference to announce a new organization to promote the expansion of airspace and airport capacity. The group, calling itself <ORGANIZATION> Partnership </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Improved </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Travel </ORGANIZATION>, envisions spending up to $ 15 million over the next two years to publicize the need for more airports and an improve air traffic control system. The executives said they hoped to enlist the support of the traveling public to pressure <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> into providing more funds for an expansion of aviation capacity. Although some `` modest'' increase in aviation taxes might be needed, most of the additional money would come from funds now bottled up in the federal aviation trust fund, the coalition leaders said. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration has denied repeatedly that any money is being held back and has argued that the surplus in the $ 5 billion aviation trust fund is only temporary. The group listed as founding members all of the major <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> air carriers, aircraft manufacturers and 16 other organizations from aviation labor unions to airport operators. `` The nation has not yet made a commitment to create an -LRB- aviation -RRB- system that can efficiently meet today's demand and anticipate tomorrow's,'' said <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Kelleher </PERSON>, chairman both of <ORGANIZATION> Southwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> and of the new coalition. He and other airline executives said that unless the airspace and ground capacity is expanded, flight delays and congestion will not only continue but become more serious each year. The result will be government-imposed constraints that will translate into higher air fares, the executives suggested. The coalition voiced many of the same complaints heard before from the aviation industry: too few air traffic controllers are being hired and trained, federal efforts to modernize the air traffic control technology is way behind schedule, there are too few airports and the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> needs to be restructured because it is hamstrung by bureacratic restrictions. `` There's not enough manpower, there are too few facilities, equipment is outdated and the -LRB- the air traffic -RRB- system's management structure is ill-suited to its mission,'' said <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>' <PERSON> Crandall </PERSON> <PERSON> Kellerer </PERSON> alluded to the `` unique alliance'' that is represented by the coalition, which includes not only the largest air carriers but also groups representing aviation labor and the pilots of small, general aviation aircraft. `` We all share a common ground in wanting to modernize the -LRB- aviation -RRB- system,'' added <PERSON> Kellerer </PERSON>. Transportation Secretary <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Burnley </PERSON> briefly address the group and acknowledged that the federal government `` can not keep up with the rapidly changing industry'' spawned by airline deregulation. `` We are ill-equipped to that kind of dynamic,'' he said. <LOCATION> Burnley </LOCATION> in the past has called for <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to enact legislation that would allow the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> to streamline its procurement procedures and personnel policies so that they may better react to sudden changes in the aviation industry.

 A weary Police Chief <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> <PERSON> Prince </PERSON> said Tuesday he is quitting a department in turmoil over public accountability, the treatment of minorities and slayings of officers in a city he claims breeds cop-haters. <PERSON> Prince </PERSON> came into office six years ago a young reformer but left an entrenched insider. He tried to curb the use of deadly force but presided over one of the bloodiest times in department history before deciding the tension was too much. `` I woke up Easter Sunday and just did n't feel good about returning,'' <PERSON> Prince </PERSON> said at a news conference. `` I told my wife then, ` I think it's time for me to go.''' <PERSON> Prince </PERSON>, 45, said he was stepping down immediately but would serve in an advisory role through the summer. City Manager <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Knight </PERSON> appointed first Assistant Police Chief <PERSON> Louie </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Caudell </PERSON> as interim chief in the nation's seventh-largest city. In recent months, <PERSON> Prince </PERSON> had come under fire for criticizing <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> members and opposing efforts to increase the accountability of a department embattled over recent police shootings of black residents. At the request of local minority groups, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee on criminal justice held a day-long hearing in May 1987 into the department's use of deadly force but did not issue a report. Within minutes of <PERSON> Prince </PERSON>'s announcement, black <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> members who have been critics of the department called for a black chief, and insisted the new chief be an outsider. <PERSON> Caudell </PERSON> is white. Police and city leaders say <PERSON> Prince </PERSON> leaves a legacy of tension that will mark the search for a new chief, the continuing struggle over a citizens' review board and perhaps even the 1989 race for mayor. Supporters of Prince, including one law-and-order city councilman already talking about running for mayor, criticized Mayor <PERSON> Annette </PERSON> <PERSON> Strauss </PERSON> and called the retiring chief a scapegoat who was `` hounded out of office.'' The mayor denied <PERSON> Prince </PERSON> was forced out, and the 24-year <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> police veteran said his decision to resign was `` totally my own.'' <PERSON> Monica </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Dallas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Prince </PERSON> was a casualty of the recent deaths of several officers, not of political infighting. She saw more trouble on the horizon over Prince's successor. The chief angered many opponents with an outburst in January after a homeless black vagrant shot white Officer <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> <PERSON> Chase </PERSON> in a downtown parking lot. He went on television to proclaim that city leaders' criticism of his department had created a public so hostile that such a death was inevitable. He then refused to back down even after <PERSON> Strauss </PERSON> demanded an apology. <PERSON> Knight </PERSON>, who is black, also warned <PERSON> Prince </PERSON> against making public remarks about the council. The department already had been facing criticism for the police shootings of two black people. A 70-year-old black woman was shot to death by an officer responding to a burglary call at her home in October 1986. After <PERSON> Prince </PERSON> fired the officer, the <ORGANIZATION> Dallas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> passed a `` no confidence'' vote on the chief. Police also shot dead a teen-age black girl during a drug raid at an apartment complex in November 1987. <PERSON> Prince </PERSON> sharpened his differences with the <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> last year when he lobbied against an expansion of the powers of the review board to evaluate the use of police force and the creation of a special office to review minority hirings and promotions. The council introduced both changes in December. The feud with the <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> and the Chase shooting has produced a backlash of support for the police, and the <ORGANIZATION> DPA </ORGANIZATION> is seeking to go over the heads of council members and force a referendum on the review board.

The auction of that home and eight other properties, chiefly homes used by other ministry officials, raised only a fraction of the $ 4 million that ministry officials had hoped for. The ministry accepted bids on five of the nine properties, raising about $ 596,500. The <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> home attracted no bids, bids on two other properties were deemed insufficient, and a $ 425,000 bid on former <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Dortch </PERSON>'s home is still being considered, said <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> Trustee <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON>. <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> said the setback means the ministry based in nearby <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mill </LOCATION> will have to re-examine its options for raising $ 5.3 million by a May 2 bankruptcy court deadline. `` I believe that we will make it in one way or another,'' <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> said. The 9,300-square-foot lakeside house used by the <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> and his wife before he resigned a year ago amid a sex scandal boasts three kitchens, four bedrooms and 5 -LCB- bathrooms. The grounds include a two-story, heated and air-conditioned playhouse; a guardhouse; boardwalks to a white, sandy beach on nearby <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Wylie </LOCATION>; and a large dock where the <ORGANIZATION> Bakkers </ORGANIZATION> once kept their 58-foot houseboat and a small power cruiser. It was built in 1976 and enlarged four times after <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> bought it in 1981 to be used as a parsonage by the <ORGANIZATION> Bakkers </ORGANIZATION> and their two children. Auctioneer <PERSON> Rodney </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> opened the sale of the <ORGANIZATION> Bakkers </ORGANIZATION>' house by asking for $ 900,000 He stopped the auction when his asking price fell to $ 500,000 without any takers. The house was valued at about $ 1 million. `` We did n't get an offer that I thought was substantial enough to open the bidding,'' <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> said afterward. About 40 bidders participated in the 30-minute auction. One of the rejected bids was $ 900,000 for 33 acres of undeveloped land. <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> said that property and No official cause has been given for the explosions that ripped through the ammunition depot, sending rockets showering across the cities. The <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> reported Tuesday that agents from the pro-Soviet government in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> were apparently responsible. According to the newspaper, the blast was caused by three incendiary devices carried to the ammunition dump by trucks bearing Afghan license plates and equipped with time fuses. They were exploded in sequence, the newspaper said. The newspaper, quoting unidentified sources, said Pakistani military experts had told <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials that this was the cause of the blast. Unidentified <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> sources told the newspaper the explosions wiped out a major source of CIA-supplied tactical assault weapons for guerrillas battling the Soviet-backed government in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. The Pakistani Cabinet chaired by Prime Minister <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Khan </PERSON> <PERSON> Junejo </PERSON> and the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> met Tuesday to review the situation. Pakistani television said that during the Cabinet meeting, it was decided that a committee investigating the explosion should submit its findings with recommendations within 10 days and that they will be made public.

 Satanic and ritualistic practices and beliefs may be a motivating factor in a one form of child abuse, a children's welfare group said Tuesday. `` People have now moved to a new level of how to assault children,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Saxton </PERSON> of Childhelp <LOCATION> USA </LOCATION>. `` Just abusing the child in the home is not enough. We've gotten into this very sadistic kind of stuff with children.'' <PERSON> Saxton </PERSON>, who is director of a Childhelp hotline, based his remarks on initial findings of a national study to determine the extent of cult involvement in specific abuse cases. The results represent 36 separate cases, documented by 59 questionnaires from 16 states. He said 97 percent of children reported male and female abusers, 50 percent described six or more perpetrators, and more than 30 percent told of more than 11 persons involved. Sixty percent of the children responding to the questionnaires indicated the incidents lasted from seven months to two years. Seventy-eight percent of the children said they were photographed in the nude, while more than 60 percent said they were photographed during sexual activity. In two-thirds of cases, <PERSON> Sexton </PERSON> said the children said they were drugged, saw or participated in rituals, animal killings and mutilations as part of the incident. About half said they were taken to cemeteries and curches for these rituals. Roughly 46 percent of the children were forced to eat or drink bodily waste, while a little more than 40 percent were forced to ingest what they were told was human flesh or blood. Although <PERSON> Sexton </PERSON> said it would be premature to say the figures represent a national trend, he is receiving calls from therapists nationwide about adult patients exhibiting behavior or experienceing dreams similar to those of some sexually abused children. <PERSON> Sexton </PERSON> told of an incident in which a therapist had a patient who remembered having a baby when she was 13, but could not remember what happened to the child. `` Two days later I get a call from this therapist saying, ` Good God, this woman remembers having to kill her child,''' he said. <PERSON> Sexton </PERSON> also mentioned that one of his adult patients, who had been a sexual abuse victim from ages 12 through 16, gave birth to five children, all of whom `` disappeared'' in the same manner. Childhelp <LOCATION> USA </LOCATION> is California-based, non-profit organization that assists child abuse victims and their families through public education, clinical programs, research and its 24-hour child abuse hotline. According to the information from hotline's 148,452 calls last year, the incidence of sexual and physical child abuse is more than double that of the nationally accepted figures. National statistics indicate 11 percent of abuse reports are sexual, while 36 percent of the hotline calls were for sexual abuse. Similarily, national figures indicate 15.5 percent of reported abuse is physical, but calls for physical abuse totaled 37 percent of the hotline calls last year. <PERSON> Randall </PERSON> <PERSON> Silverston </PERSON>, Childhelp research director, said many children are being exposed to the threat of AIDS as a result of sexual abuse. The organization and the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Irvine </LOCATION>, were asking the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institutes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> to fund a three-year study of those children who are in the high-risk category.

 A delegation of Soviets arrived in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> on Tuesday for a second round of talks about on-site monitoring to verify an arms control pact signed at the summit last December, a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> spokesman said. The dozen or so Soviets arrived at Dulles International Airport on an <ORGANIZATION> Aeroflot </ORGANIZATION> flight from <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> and were to open talks Wedneday with an American team headed by Brig. Gen. <PERSON> Roland </PERSON> <PERSON> Lajoie </PERSON>, said the spokesman, Cmdr. <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Pease </PERSON>. The Soviet team is headed by Gen. <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> Medvedev </PERSON>, who helped negotiate the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces treaty under which the superpowers are to destroy nuclear-tipped missiles with ranges from 300 to 3,000 miles. <PERSON> Lajoie </PERSON> heads the <ORGANIZATION> On-Site </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inspection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, created shortly after President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> signed the INF accord at the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> summit last December. In talks scheduled to last until Saturday, <PERSON> Lajoie </PERSON> and <PERSON> Medvedev </PERSON> will discuss what a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official called `` housekeeping details,'' such as living quarters for the inspectors, the transportation of equipment, and call signs that aircraft carrying the teams will use while in the other's airspace, said <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> officials. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> agency will select and train an estimated 125 people to monitor the destruction of the Soviet missiles and verify that no more are deployed. Thirty days after <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> notify each other that the treaty has been ratified and is in effect, members of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> teams will visit 126 sites in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, six in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, and one in <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> over two months to verify data supplied by the Soviets concerning their forces. The Soviets will visit 21 sites in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> where the missiles have been made or deployed. Once those inspections are complete, teams of 30 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> inspectors will be stationed for three months at a stretch over the next 13 years in the small city of <LOCATION> Votkinsk </LOCATION> near the <LOCATION> Ural </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountains </LOCATION>, where the Soviets produce a longer range missile that resembles the SS-20, one of the weapons banned under the INF pact. The Soviets will station similar teams in <LOCATION> Magna </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>, where the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has been producing components of <ORGANIZATION> Pershing </ORGANIZATION> 2 missiles, also to be eliminated under the treaty.

 Federal housing officials plan to significantly increase the number of people getting vouchers to help pay their rent, Housing and Urban Development Secretary <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> said Tuesday. The voucher program, the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration's alternative to building more public housing, now assists about 100,000 low-income families, with another 34,000 to be added by the fall, <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> told a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Appropriations subcommittee. <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> plans to add another 100,000 families in 1989, he said. Rather than subsidizing housing units, the program gives poor families a voucher which can be used to pay a portion of the rent on living space they choose for themselves. The value of the voucher is fixed according to each family's income, leaving the amount of additional rent flexible. The program was made permanent by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> last year. `` Vouchers give families the dignity of choice, offering them the opportunity to locate near family and friends, schools, churches and jobs,'' rather than in public housing projects, said <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>. He appeared before the subcommittee on HUD-independent agencies to discuss his $ 21.6 billion budget request for fiscal 1989. <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION>'s 1988 budget is $ 18.6 billion. <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> said the number of households to be assisted by various <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> programs would increase from 4.3 million in 1988 to 4.4 million next year. Subcommittee Chairman Rep. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Boland </PERSON>, D-Mass., questioned <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>'s conclusion that the major problem for low-income families is not the availability of houses but their affordability <PERSON> Boland </PERSON> said some studies show a severe shortage of low-income housing as units built in the 1960s are converted into more profitable uses. <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> quoted <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> statistics putting rental vacancy rates at their highest in 20 years, with an 8.4 percent vacancy rate among apartments renting between $ 200 and $ 249 a month. <PERSON> Boland </PERSON> also questioned <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION>'s estimate last week that it would take between $ 7.5 billion and $ 9.2 billion to bring the nation's 1.3 million public housing units up to modern safety and sanitation standards He said other estimates put the cost as high as $ 20 billion. Rep. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Green </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.Y. </LOCATION>, asked <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> if he is concerned that many middle-income people are being priced out of the housing market. `` I'm not as disturbed as you, because I do n't see that it is such a big problem,'' the secretary said. <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>, who is the only Cabinet member still in office from among President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s original appointees, noted record sales and record housing starts in recent years. `` Somebody's buying the homes,'' he said. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Demery </PERSON>, assistant secretary for housing, told the subcommittee several factors have affected middle-class families' ability to buy homes, including a decline in savings brought about partly by increased education costs Meanwhile, former developer <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Rouse </PERSON> told a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> should appropriate another $ 3.4 billion a year to support a federal program to increase the supply of low-income and rental housing by the year 2000. <PERSON> Rouse </PERSON>, who chaired an ad hoc committee which studied housing needs in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, told a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> banking subcommittee that the nation faces the worst housing crisis in the past 10 years. <PERSON> Rouse </PERSON>, who headed his own development company and now is chairman and chief executive officer of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enterprise </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>, said the $ 3.4 billion would be added to the $ 13.6 billion currently available. Half of the $ 3.4 billion would be allocated to the states, which would be required to match the funds by various means: providing land or distributing money to local authorities. The other half would go directly to cities which would have wide discretion for use of the funds but would not be required to match the money.

<HEAD>World Bank Establishes Body To Insure Against War Losses</HEAD>

 World Bank President <PERSON> Barber </PERSON> <PERSON> Conable </PERSON> on Tuesday announced the formation of a worldwide body to insure private investors against loss from war and other hostile actions. `` The flow of private investment must be strengthened,'' <PERSON> Conable </PERSON> told a news conference while saying investors put $ 16 billion into Third World countries in 1981 and only $ 10 billion in 1987. The new <ORGANIZATION> Multilateral </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guarantee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> has 29 countries which formally have accepted membership. Nine of them are industrial nations, including the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, whose ratifications arrived Tuesday. Another 34 governments of both industrial and Third World countries have signed the agreement but not yet ratified it. So far, <LOCATION> Ecuador </LOCATION> is the only Latin American government to ratify. Others, including <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, have not signed. Some Latin American countries have a strong tradition against allowing foreigners any share in settling disputes with their citizens, as might have to be done under the agreement setting up the agency. <PERSON> Conable </PERSON> said the new body's Governing Council will hold its first meeting in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> on June 8 to adopt bylaws and choose a board of directors. He said he expects the new agency to be doing business by the end of the year. He added that after it is in operation it can take up a proposal that originated with Japanese Financer Minister <PERSON> Kiichi </PERSON> <PERSON> Miyazawa </PERSON> to enable it to guarantee bank loans as well. Such operations would greatly broaden its scope and probably require more capital. The object of the new agency is to attract more direct investment into Third World countries, to help them build the industries they need so they can produce more goods, create jobs and make more payments on their debts. New investments also would reduce the need to add to their existing debt, now over $ 1 trillion. It will begin with $ 1.08 billion, but only 10 percent of that will be paid in cash by the member governments. <PERSON> Conable </PERSON> will be its president as well as heading the bank. The agency's immediate future was assured when <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> voted $ 44 million for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> participation at the end of last year. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> contribution will be the largest. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> already has its own agency to insure American investors, the <ORGANIZATION> Overseas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Private </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> MIGA </ORGANIZATION>'s services will be available to investors from all member countries Citizens of a host country also can be protected if they bring home assets from abroad. That provision is designed to help solve a major problem in Third World nations, the flight of billions of dollars that their citizens have sent to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and other havens considered safer than their own territory. In addition to protecting investors against war and civil disturbances, the agency's insurance policies will cut a company's losses if the government of a country where the money is invested restricts the right to take money out of the country, expropriates property or repudiates a contract Other risks also can be covered by a decision of the agency's board of directors

 Lawyers for Lt. Col. <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON> and three co-defendants charged in the Iran-Contra affair urged a federal judge on Tuesday to put off their trial until next year to give them sufficient time to prepare a defense. Attorneys for <PERSON> North </PERSON>, along with former national security adviser <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON> and two arms dealers, retired <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> Maj. Gen. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Secord </PERSON> and <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Hakim </PERSON>, objected to the prosecution's proposal to begin the trial in July, instead proposing a March 1989 date. `` We have a million documents in the case. <PERSON> Evelyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Wood </PERSON> could not read those documents between now and July,'' said <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> Brendan </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, referring to the founder of the famous speed-reading course. `` There is no conceivable way'' of disposing of the many pretrial issues before early next year, said <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>, who proposed that the trial begin two months after President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> leaves office. `` I'm frightened to have a trial during a political election year,'' <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> told <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Gerhard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON>. <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON>, who said he was concerned about `` having the trial under way while ballots were being cast,'' and independent counsel <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> both proposed starting the trial in July. <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> said the trial could take three or four months, but defense lawyers suggested it could take even longer. `` This is a difficult case,'' <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> said. But `` it's not going to be made any easier by just putting off the trial date.'' The possibility of a presidential pardon for North and <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON> was not mentioned at the hearing, but it is widely believed that the defense would want to take advantage of such a possibility. The White House has said <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has not considered pardons, but the president has repeatedly said he thought the defendants did nothing illegal. At the outset of the hearing, <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> said `` this case is not going to be on a slow track. There is no need for it to be on a slow track.'' But a number of obstacles to a summer trial were raised during the 3 -LCB- - hour hearing, the first since the four defendants were arraigned on charges they conspired to illegally divert profits to the Nicaraguan Contra rebels from the U.S.-Iran arms sales These include the issue of whether <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> obtained evidence against the defendants from their compelled testimony to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, as well as a complicated procedure for government review of 300,000 classified documents that <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> ruled should be given to the defense. Unless those procedures can be streamlined, `` were talking about a trial next year at the earliest,'' <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> said he could make 50,000 pages available by month's end following a review of the sensitive documents by an interagency task force for material that might compromise <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> intelligence operations. <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> expressed frustration at the detailed review procedure and warned that the case would be dismissed if the government does n't declassify the documents needed by both the prosecution and defense. `` The classification system must be adjusted to the needs of this case or the case will collapse,'' <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> said. The defendants should have the documents, the judge said, because `` they are entitled to show to the jury what motivated them, why they did it, who told them to do it, and what was going on.'' `` I have to allow them that chance to give them a fair trial.'' <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> also invited a challenge to the constitutionality of the Classified Information Procedures Act when <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, one of <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s attorneys, complained that the security measures the law prescribes would hamper defense preparation for trial. <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> scheduled an April 25 hearing at which <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> will outline procedures followed by his office to prevent his staff from being exposed to the congressional testimony of the defendants. The defense will get an opportunity at that time to present evidence that at least one witness gave grand jury testimony that was influenced by what the defendants told the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> committees that investigated the Iran-Contra affair. The law prohibits <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> from using the compelled congressional testimony of <LOCATION> North </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hakim </PERSON> as evidence against them. Unlike his co-defendants, <PERSON> Secord </PERSON> testified on Capitol Hill without a grant of limited immunity from prosecution. <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> warned that he will not proceed to trial unless he is satisfied that <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> obtained his evidence against the defendants independently of their congressional testimony. `` If we do n't have a case to be tried, we are not going to try it,'' the judge said. Earlier, <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> scolded the prosecution for playing a `` cat and mouse'' game by delaying the production of documents he had ordered turned over to the defense. `` We're not here to play games,'' said <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON>, who added that the defense already has received more than 30,000 documents, including the records of Swiss bank accounts through which the arms sales were brokered.

 A hijacked jet left <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION> for <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION> on Wednesday carrying more than 30 hostages held for over a week by Moslem gunmen demanding freedom for terrorists jailed in <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>. The blue-and-white <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 747 took off at 1:17 a.m. Wednesday -LRB- 6:17 p.m. EDT Tuesday -RRB- after the hijackers freed 12 hostages. Forty people were believed on board the aircraft after the latest release, including a half-dozen hijackers. The plane was seized a week ago by gunmen demanding freedom for 17 pro-Iranian terrorists held in <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>. The plane was refueled after repeated demands by the hijackers, who have killed two hostages in <LOCATION> Larnaca </LOCATION>. The freed passengers were driven from the <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 747 at around 10:25 p.m. -LRB- 3:25 p.m. EDT -RRB- then taken to <LOCATION> Larnaca </LOCATION> <LOCATION> General </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>, reporters at the scene and hospital officials said. A hijacker told the tower the released included two Palestinians with Jordanian passports and 10 others who were sick, poor or had numerous children. They said the releases were a `` goodwill'' gesture but added also that the Jordanian nationals were freed as a `` present to the uprising in <LOCATION> Palestine </LOCATION>,'' a reference to four months of anti-Israeli violence in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. The plane's engines started shortly after the latest passengers were released, and loud bangs rang out across the tarmac. Officials said the noise was caused by the engines. <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> and government negotiators held talks with the hijackers before the latest hostages were being freed. The hijackers said earlier in the day that they had on death shrouds. One hijacker, in a statement radioed to the <LOCATION> Larnaca </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> control tower, cited Koranic verses usually read at funerals that said `` those killed in the name of God are always alive.'' <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> chairman <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> was quoted today as saying the hijackers want to fly to <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION> and `` arrangements are being made to this end.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Kuwait </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> told reporters in <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> he expected the hijacking to end tonight. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister <PERSON> Javad </PERSON> <PERSON> Larijana </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> had offered to take the jet by force after it was forced to land in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> last week, but <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> rejected the idea. At one point today, the hijackers radioed the control tower demanding the plane be refueled in 45 minutes. The deadline passed without incident after two <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> officials went out on the tarmac and spoke with the hijackers. One hijacker later radioed that they had extended the deadline `` for a short time ... to permit the mediators to act'' in getting the plane refueled. `` We are warning against false promises,'' he said in broken English. When a C-130 military transport landed a short time later, one of the hijackers screamed over the radio: `` Identify this plane.'' The tower replied it was a Greek air force plane carrying supplies. The hijacker replied: `` My men were about to shoot at it.'' The hijackers of the <ORGANIZATION> Kuwait </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 747 shot and killed a second passenger Monday. The hijackers are demanding <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> free 17 convicted terrorists and have said they want to leave for an unspecified `` neutral country.'' The hijackers are armed with grenades and handguns. They have repeatedly threatened to blow up the plane since the hijacking began a week ago. The hijackers' statement today indicated, as had been suspected, that the gunmen are Shiite Moslems. The statement said `` hail the glory of Imam <PERSON> Mahdi </PERSON>,'' the messiah-like holy person Shiites believe will one day appear on earth. Only Shiite Moslems revere the imams, or saints, among the Islamic sects. The 17 pro-Iranian terrorists whose freedom is sought by the hijackers were convicted in 1984 of bombing the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and French embassies in <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>. The emirate has rejected the demand. All but one of the 17 are Shiites. Among those on the plane are three members of <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>'s royal family, a man and two women. Foreign Minister <PERSON> Sheik </PERSON> <PERSON> Sabah </PERSON> <PERSON> al-Ahmed </PERSON> <PERSON> Al-Sabah </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> said Monday his country is prepared to lose more hostages rather than give in. `` We will try our utmost to protect our dear ones aboard the plane, but we will not surrender to any blackmail, even if we lose more of them,'' he said. He added that the presence of three members of the ruling <PERSON> Al-Sabah </PERSON> family aboard the jet `` will not influence our decision.'' Terrorist groups in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> have threatened to kill foreign hostages they are holding, including three Americans, if security forces storm the plane. Two of the Americans are held by a group that also has demanded freedom for the 17 terrorists jailed in <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>. In today's statement, the hijackers declared in classical, Koranic Arabic: `` We have decided to call our plane the plane of greatest martyrdom and death. Death with glory is better than life under humiliation ... We call on the <LOCATION> Kuwaiti </LOCATION> people to revolt against the <LOCATION> Kuwaiti </LOCATION> dictatorship. We'd like to point out we're not against the people of <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>, but against the regime.'' They added: `` We have decided to wear the death shrouds under our clothes and that either all our 17 brothers come back to us or else we shall meet, in our shrouds, in the heaven of eternal happiness.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Kuwait </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> identified the man killed Monday as <PERSON> Khalid </PERSON> <PERSON> Ayyub </PERSON> <PERSON> Ismail </PERSON> <PERSON> Ayyub </PERSON> <PERSON> Bandar </PERSON>, a 20-year-old worker for <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>'s fire brigade On Saturday, the hijackers killed another man, also a Kuwaiti. The plane was hijacked April 5 with 112 people aboard on a flight from <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> and forced down in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, where 57 people were freed. The jet left <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> on Friday after refueling. After <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> refused to let it land, the plane flew to <LOCATION> Larnaca </LOCATION>. One hostage was freed in <LOCATION> Larnaca </LOCATION> on Saturday.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> officials Tuesday defended their widebody jets against complaints of serious quality control problems from at least three airlines. <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Condit </PERSON>, executive vice president for <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airplanes </ORGANIZATION>, said recent publicity about the complaints against its 747s and 767s stemmed partly from the company's open way of dealing with its problems, which has made many workers aware of items that need improving. `` Air transportation is the safest transportation mode there is'' and is getting even safer because airlines, manufacturers and regulatory agencies work together to identify and correct problems, <PERSON> Condit </PERSON> said. `` I could not be prouder than I am about the kind of employee we have in this country. ... The people are dedicated and proud of what they build,'' he told reporters at <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Everett </LOCATION> plant, where the widebodies are made. One airline complained specifically that the aerospace company's workers seemed oblivious that defects could compromise an aircraft's safety <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION>'s news conference came one day after the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> confirmed it has issued 50 directives in the last two years telling airlines to fix various problems with <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> jets. The most recent warning was issued Friday concerning possible fuel leaks in the cargo area of <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION>'s 747-200 series of jets. The leaks can be caused by a bolt giving way in a wing section, and the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> ordered airlines to inspect them before returning the planes to service. <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> officials said the order applied to 317 operating 747-200s. Airlines, <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> officials have said that none of the defects cited has been linked to a crash or other major damage. However, Friday's directive warned, `` Fuel in this compartment could result in a fire and substantial damage.'' <PERSON> Nick </PERSON> <PERSON> Wantiez </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Seattle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> office said Tuesday the directive came after reports of incidents by <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lines </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Lufthansa </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> India </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Aerolineas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Argentinas </ORGANIZATION> and a leasing company, starting Nov. 21 with a <ORGANIZATION> JAL </ORGANIZATION> report in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> of a fuel leak. <PERSON> Condit </PERSON> said the recent publicity presented only a `` snapshot'' view of <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION>'s continuing efforts to see how its planes can be improved. He also said <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> has become more open with its workers and has shared letters of complaint from airline customers with top managers and their staffs. That openness makes it more likely the public will hear about the complaints, he said. <PERSON> Wantiez </PERSON> said the agency has expanded its normal monitoring of production at <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> to include recent complaints by airlines, which range from wrong parts to incorrectly installed firefighting systems. `` We are putting together a plan this week to deal with these complaints and to determine what actions must be taken to assure compliance with federal regulations,'' <PERSON> Wantiez </PERSON> said. Complaints have been sent to <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> by <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lines </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> All </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nippon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION>, a domestic Japanese carrier. <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Reich </PERSON>, an aerospace industry analyst for <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, said airlines may be taking an opportunity to improve their leverage with <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION>, the world's biggest maker of commercial aircraft. `` I think that what the airlines are doing is holding <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION>'s feet to the fire,'' <PERSON> Reich </PERSON> said `` They want an airplane with absolutely no defects now.''

 The White House said Tuesday that President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was upset and it was an `` outrage'' that former presidential spokesman <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Speakes </PERSON> had made up quotes and given them to reporters as <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s words. `` Everyone is appalled that he made up quotes,'' said spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>, who replaced <PERSON> Speakes </PERSON> 14 months ago. In a kiss-and-tell book that has roiled White House officials, <PERSON> Speakes </PERSON> disclosed that he made up a widely reported statement that was attributed to <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> during his first summit with Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> in 1985. In another instance, when a <ORGANIZATION> Korean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lines </ORGANIZATION> passenger jet was shot down by the Soviets in 1983, the president `` had almost nothing to say'' during meetings with the Cabinet and congressional leaders, <PERSON> Speakes </PERSON> said. So, he said, he took statements made by Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> and attributed them to <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. <PERSON> Speakes </PERSON> said Tuesday that he subsequently told the president what he had done and <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> `` never objected.'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>, at a news briefing dominated by questions about <PERSON> Speakes </PERSON>' revelation, blasted his predecessor, who in his six years as <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> spokesman had boasted that he never lied to the press. `` It's a damned outrage, that's what it is,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. `` I resent it so much. It casts asperions on the presidency and on my position ... It's wrong ... He should n't have done it and ... I wo n't do it,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. He said he had not talked to the president, `` but I'm sure he would be upset about it. I'm sure he is.'' Later, after conferring with the president, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said, `` I stand by my comments.'' And, another White House official, speaking anonymously, said flatly, `` The president is upset about the book.'' <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> spokesman shot during the 1981 assassination attempt on <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, said `` the best writer for the president is the president himself.'' `` No one talks for President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> but President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>,'' said <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>, who still holds the title of White House press secretary and goes to the office about once a week. `` We had a half-joke around the office, let <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> be <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>.'' Conservative leaders who met with <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> on Tuesday also were angry. `` I think <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Speakes </PERSON> has done a disservice to the president,'' said <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Flaherty </PERSON>, chairman of Citizens for <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Weyrich </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Free </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>, said, `` The president is ill-served by all of these people who are in public service and then write books the minute they get out and reveal things that ought not to be revealed. `` All they're in it for is making a buck ... and frankly, they ought to be ashamed of themselves,'' <PERSON> Weyrich </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Speakes </PERSON> had no reaction to the White House statements. `` I'd be better off not to comment,'' he said in a telephone interview from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, where he is vice president for communications at <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. However, he offered no apologies, saying `` It's an honest book.'' <PERSON> Speakes </PERSON> said the two instances of phony quotes he cited `` were the only two that I specifically recall. ... It was a case of knowing the president well and knowing how he felt about the events taking place and knowing what he would say.'' He said he had told <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> about the quotes. `` I generally told him, you know, what I had done, you know, and the reasons for doing it. He never objected to, you know, these cases where I said, you know, I've gone ahead and done this,'' <PERSON> Speakes </PERSON> said. In his book, `` Speaking Out,'' <PERSON> Speakes </PERSON> recalled it was <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> who said the shooting down of the Korean airliner was not a problem between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, but `` a Soviet vs. the world problem.'' However, <PERSON> Speakes </PERSON> told reporters the president had said those words. He also attributed to <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> some of <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>'s suggestions about retaliatory action. `` My decision to put <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>'s words in <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s mouth played well and neither of them complained,'' <PERSON> Speakes </PERSON> wrote. Discussing the summit, <PERSON> Speakes </PERSON> said he `` felt that <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> was really getting the advantage over us in his give-and-take with reporters, while <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was very tentative and stilted'' in his comments. `` Fearing that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was losing the media version of Star Wars, I instructed <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Weinberg </PERSON> -LRB- a White House press aide -RRB- to draft some quotes for the president,'' <PERSON> Speakes </PERSON> wrote. `` I polished the quotes and told the press that while the two leaders stood together at the end of one session, the president said to <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, ` There is much that divides us, but I believe the world breathes easier because we are talking here together.''' `` Another <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> quote which we manufactured that received extensive play in the press was, ` Our differences are serious, but so is our commitment to improving understanding,''' <PERSON> Speakes </PERSON> wrote. `` In retrospect, it was clearly wrong to take such liberties,'' he added. `` Certainly, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> would not have disavowed the words, but the Soviets could have said they never heard anything like that. Luckily, the Russians did n't dispute the quotes and I had been able to spruce up the president's image by taking a bit of liberty with my PR man's license.'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>, commenting on his policy, said, `` I do n't make up quotes and I do n't just write them and run them by the president. `` On the other hand, the whole business of communication is the drafting of material that the president may use in one form or another, whether it's a speech or a statement or quotes on a various issue that tell what the president thinks,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>City Gives Adoption Agency Notice of Closing</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Mayor <PERSON> Wolfram </PERSON> <PERSON> Brueck </PERSON> said Tuesday a private adoption agency is `` damaging the basic dignity of mankind'' and will be closed in a week unless it proves it is operating legally. The <PERSON> Hamel </PERSON> and <PERSON> Keller </PERSON> service sells babies to adoptive parents for a profit. Private adoption agencies are illegal in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, but <PERSON> Hamel </PERSON> and <PERSON> Keller </PERSON> claims there is a loophole in the law involving a declaration of fatherhood. <PERSON> Uwe </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamel </PERSON> told The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> after hearing of the city's order: `` I am not concerned about this at all I will simply continue.'' One of the agency's advertisements reads: `` I can arrange immediately for a child. The prices: 30,000 marks -LRB- $ 18,000 -RRB- for a child from the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>; 15,000 marks -LRB- $ 9,000 -RRB- for a child from the Far East; 45,000 marks -LRB- $ 27,000 -RRB- for a German child.'' According to the agency, a prospective adoptive father declares an illegimate child to be his and makes a contract with the baby's mother, who is paid a fee to verify the claim The man then applies to a court for the child to be declared his legitimate offspring. <PERSON> Hamel </PERSON>'s agency has operated for two months. He claims it has arranged the adoptions of nine babies.

<HEAD>Publisher Says Free and Paid Newspapers Have Common Rivals</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Newspapers that sell their issues and those that distribute free have greater rivals than each other, <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Ingersoll </PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Ingersoll </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Publications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, said Tuesday. Ingersoll's company is the largest free-circulation publisher in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, but publishes other newspapers with paid circulation. He bought 10 regional British papers of both kinds in January. `` In the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, there are still paid daily publishers who view free newspapers of any kind as a threatening phenomenon, but we do n't happen to feel that way ourselves,'' he told a <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> conference on the newspaper industry. `` Free circulation and paid do n't have to be pitched in mortal combat. Indeed, both have more serious natural enemies, several of which have yet to show their full strength in the U.K. -LRB- <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> -RRB-.'' He said the real rivals include development of local commercial broadcasting, direct mail and outdoor advertising. <PERSON> Ingersoll </PERSON> said his company publishes free-circulation newspapers wherever it publishes paid papers in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Also, he said, `` We publish free-circulation newspapers in markets in which other publishers, paid or free, have defaulted on their obligation to deliver dependable readership to local retail advertisers.'' <ORGANIZATION> Ingersoll </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Publications </ORGANIZATION> is the first foreign company to invest in the British regional press, where `` the free versus paid wars ... are relatively new,'' the publisher said. It acquired the <ORGANIZATION> Birmingham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Birmingham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Evening </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mail </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Coventry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Evening </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telegraph </ORGANIZATION> and the regional Sunday publication Sunday Mercury, all paid newspapers, and six free weeklies in the <LOCATION> Midlands </LOCATION> region. The privately held company publishes more than 40 daily papers, including the Trentonian, and more than 200 weeklies. It has annual revenues of $ 700 million and employs 11,000 people. `` It is arguable that the traditional paid daily no longer exists,'' <PERSON> Ingersoll </PERSON> said, adding that papers rely on advertising and not circulation revenue for their profits. He said daily newspaper circulation began deteriorating after World War II because populations became more transient, sprawling suburban markets developed and commerical broadcasting grew. Free papers moved into the gap, <PERSON> Ingersoll </PERSON> said.

However, <ORGANIZATION> Smithsonian </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> McC </PERSON>. <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> later issued a statement calling the <ORGANIZATION> Smithsonian </ORGANIZATION>'s association with the plan `` unwise and unworkable.'' In a letter to <PERSON> Inouye </PERSON> released late Tuesday, <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> detailed his objections, which include building a new museum to house borrowed objects; placing undue financial burdens for the facility on the <ORGANIZATION> Smithsonian </ORGANIZATION>; and not giving the <ORGANIZATION> Smithsonian </ORGANIZATION> sufficient authority over the new museum. The Museum of the American Indian long has been starved for space, visitors and funding. The 15,000-square-foot building in a decaying neighborhood is too small to display more than about 1 percent of its million-artifact collection at a time, so most of the objects have languished in a <LOCATION> Bronx </LOCATION> warehouse. The compromise was aimed at resolving a longstanding dispute over where to house the collection amassed by <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Gustav </PERSON> <PERSON> Heye </PERSON> and established by his will. The trust stipulates that the collection remain in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> state </LOCATION>, spurring <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> officials to rebuff an offer in 1986 by <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> tycoon <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> <PERSON> Perot </PERSON> to move the museum to <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> suggested that the <ORGANIZATION> Smithsonian </ORGANIZATION> `` stand aside at this time so that the possibility of making the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Custom </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> available to the <ORGANIZATION> Heye </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> can be pursued.''

 Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said Tuesday he hoped former <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> aides <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON> and <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON> would be found `` innocent of any wrongdoing'' in the Iran-Contra affair. As to a possible pardon, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he would deal with that issue only if he is forced to face it if elected president. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> made the comments in interviews with <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> reporters in a day in which he pitched the first ball in a baseball game, called it `` warming up'' for the fall and defended his attacks against the `` ghost of <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was asked if he would pardon then-National Security Adviser <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON> and then-White House aide North if elected. He called the question `` too hypothetical,'' but then added: `` I hope, my own personal hope is, they're found innocent of any wrongdoing.'' `` If I had to face that -LRB- a pardon -RRB- at some time, then I'd keep my own counsel and make my own decision.'' It was the first time the vice president had expressed a desire that the two indicted former officials be found innocent. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> defended anew his refusal to disclose the advice he gave President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> on the Iran-Contra matter. `` I've taken lots of shots -LRB- on that -RRB-. But it does n't bother me because I know I'm doing what's right,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told his interviewers. On another subject, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told reporters that he did not think he was too aristocratic to build wide support. `` If so, why would I have cleaned them -LRB- Republican rivals -RRB- up in the primaries?'' he asked. `` For you to suggest that some aristocratic bias makes it impossible for me to reach out _ just you watch,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> declared. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, campaigning in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> one week before the state's primary elections, threw out the ball for the start of a <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mets </ORGANIZATION> baseball game `` We're warming up for the fall race,'' he joked, practicing by tossing an apple aboard <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> Two with Rep. <PERSON> Guy </PERSON> <PERSON> Molinari </PERSON>, R-N. The vice president continued what aides depicted as a generic campaign against Democrats in speeches taking aim at the policies of former President <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>. `` That's exactly what we'd have if we ended up electing one of them,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told reporters at an airport news conference in <LOCATION> Syracuse </LOCATION>. He said he saw little difference among the three Democratic contenders, <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and Sen. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> _ all of whom were also in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, for a debate and for primary campaigning. Asked by reporters why we was campaigning against <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>, who left office in 1981, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said: `` Because the policies of the Democrats will take us right back to the high interest rates and the double-digit inflation of the Carter years.'' At a later speech at a shopping mall in <LOCATION> Syracuse </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> expanded upon the theme, saying he had no problem `` running against the ghost of <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>.'' `` Do you want Americans to go back to those terrible days of malaise and darkness?'' he asked. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> attended a $ 1,000-a-ticket fund-raising reception Tuesday night sponsored by developer <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>, who endorsed the vice president's candidacy. `` He's a great gentleman,'' said <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told the packed reception at <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s Plaza Hotel that the Democratic contenders `` want to set the clock back'' and `` bust the federal government.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has already raised the $ 27 million allowable by federal election law for direct campaign spending. His current fund-raising activities are designed to raise money for accounting expenses exempt from the limit and for party organizations. At a fund-raising breakfast Tuesday in <LOCATION> Schenectady </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told supporters, `` I ca n't wait to take on whichever one of those Democrats win the Democratic nomination.'' In his campaign stops in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has focused on economic achievements under President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s administration. `` I want to lead the country in making good changes last, and building on them,'' he told the <LOCATION> Schenectady </LOCATION> audience. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Teeley </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s spokesman, said it is still not clear when <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> will begin to give the vice president campaign assistance, since <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> is still technically a candidate. `` We welcome any activity on the part of the president as quickly as he feels it's appropriate,'' <PERSON> Teeley </PERSON> said. Before the Trump fund-raiser, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he disagreed with comments by <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> on a Palestinian state. `` We should n't have a Palestinian state,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` It is n't in the interest of the national security of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> ... It's not good foreign policy -LRB- But -RRB- solving the Palestinian problem is.''

 A group of men hurled grenades at a house in northern <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, dashed inside and fired submachine guns on the four sleeping occupants, killing them, according to news reports Tuesday. Men in combat fatigues later fired grenades at the house from helicopters, the reports said. The <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> daily newspapers El Universal and Excelsior quoted <PERSON> Federico </PERSON> <PERSON> Valenzuela </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Sonora </LOCATION> state judicial police director, as saying that the slayings were related to drug trafficking. <PERSON> Valenzuela </PERSON> said police had no suspects in the attack Monday in <LOCATION> Caborca </LOCATION>, about 60 south of the <LOCATION> Mexico-Arizona </LOCATION> border. The men in the helicopters earlier planted a bomb in front of another house in the city, but no injuries were reported, newspapers said. <LOCATION> Sonora </LOCATION> state judicial police in <LOCATION> Caborca </LOCATION> said by telephone Tuesday that federal authorities were handling the investigation. An operator at the federal public ministry in <LOCATION> Caborca </LOCATION> said all agents and federal police officers were out of the office and unavailable for comment. According to the <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> reports and another published Tuesday in the daily newspaper <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Norte </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Monterrey </LOCATION>, the attacks occurred about 6:30 a.m. Monday. Witnesses reported that men driving a small truck and two other vechicles stopped in front of a house in a residential neighborhood, threw grenades at the door, then burst inside firing submachine guns at the four sleeping occupants. Police later recovered the bodies of the four men. Men in three helicopters then launched grenades at the home, according to the <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> reports. Other witnesses reported seeing men in camouflage clothing with black paint on their faces descend from one of the three helicopters to another house, according to the news reports. The men planted explosives at the house, then returned to the helicopter. The bombs detonated as the helicopter flew away, <PERSON> El </PERSON> <PERSON> Norte </PERSON> said. According to police, the home is owned by <PERSON> Miguel </PERSON> <PERSON> Angel </PERSON> <PERSON> Caro </PERSON> <PERSON> Quintero </PERSON>, brother of <PERSON> Rafael </PERSON> <PERSON> Caro </PERSON> <PERSON> Quintero </PERSON>, who is jailed in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> in connection with the slaying of American drug agent <PERSON> Enrique </PERSON> <PERSON> Camarena </PERSON> <PERSON> Salazar </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Norte </ORGANIZATION> reported.

 The <LOCATION> Williamsburg </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bridge </LOCATION> was built in 1903 for bicycles and horse-drawn buggies, but it has had to carry a much heavier load for most of its 85 years, and now one of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s busiest commuter spans is falling apart The culprits are decades of rust and the daily rumblings of more than 100,000 cars and 420 subway trains that ferry commuters over the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> between the <LOCATION> Williamsburg </LOCATION> section of <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION> and the Lower East Side of <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>. They did, at least, until Tuesday, when the city <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> closed the bridge indefinitely to all traffic. All but four of the <LOCATION> Williamsburg </LOCATION>'s eight traffic lanes had already been closed this week and service suspended on the two subway lines that cross the bridge. `` It was decided it would serve the interests of safety to close the bridge until a further evaluation is made of the material submitted to us,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> after a meeting of city and state engineers and officials. The city acted after inspectors discovered such extensive corrosion that they feared the bridge might collapse. A team of more than 60 inspectors is being deployed to determine the extent of the problem. `` We're finding that, yes, there is corrosion, yes, the bridge is worse than what we imagined,'' said <PERSON> Chuck </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON>, deputy commissioner of the state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION>. What has happened to the <LOCATION> Williamsburg </LOCATION> is hardly unique. The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Highway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> keeps track of 271,300 bridges, and of those, 36,000 have some kind of structural deficiency and 41,000 are considered functionally obsolete. The government estimates it would cost more than $ 50 billion to bring all the nation's bridges up to standard. `` This is a real crisis in the infrastructure situation in this country that people are n't focusing on,'' said <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Toohey </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Road </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Builders </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. `` It's a national crisis, and in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> state it's a lot worse than in other places.'' In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, decay has forced the closing of two lanes of traffic on each of two other major bridges across the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> and the Queensboro. But the <LOCATION> Williamsburg </LOCATION> `` is certainly one of the worst bridges that we have,'' said Foster J. Beach III, regional director of the state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION>. `` For 80 years, the bridge really has n't been maintained.'' Problems were built into the bridge. Most suspension bridges at the time were built with galvanized steel cables; the <LOCATION> Williamsburg </LOCATION> builders chose ungalvanized steel to cut costs. The cables were coated with oil to protect them from corrosion, but the protection did n't last. And just at the time when the corrosion was beginning to cause serious damage, the city became engulfed in the fiscal crisis of the 1970s. Bridge maintenance and inspections went by the wayside. Some steel strands within the cables already have snapped. The <LOCATION> Williamsburg </LOCATION> has always been the <PERSON> Rodney </PERSON> <PERSON> Dangerfield </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> bridges. It lacks the elegance of the <LOCATION> George </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bridge </LOCATION>, the romance of the <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bridge </LOCATION> and the impressive span of the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge. Stout and practical, the <LOCATION> Williamsburg </LOCATION> `` received a great deal of criticism for its lack of aesthetic consideration'' when it was finished, according to engineer <PERSON> Nils </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Olsson </PERSON>, who wrote about the bridge in the <ORGANIZATION> Municipal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION>. At the time, the <LOCATION> Williamsburg </LOCATION>, at 1,600 feet, was the longest suspension bridge in the world. The city now must decide whether to repair the <LOCATION> Williamsburg </LOCATION> or replace it. Just last month, engineering firms from around the world presented 25 proposals for replacements. This summer, the city is to decide. The cost of replacing the bridge has been estimated at $ 200 million to $ 600 million. The cost of renovating was estimated at $ 250 million _ but that was before the latest damage was found. In the meantime, said <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Schwartz </PERSON>, the city transportation department's chief engineer, there has been yet another unexpected development. `` We're finding that thousands of people have returned to walking across the bridge,'' he said. <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> said he did not know if pedestrians would be barred from the bridge.

 <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Democratic Leader <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> announced Tuesday he will not seek re-election to the party post he has held for a dozen years, touching off a wide-open race to succeed him. The 70-year-old West Virginian said he will run for a sixth <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> term and, if elected and the chamber remains under <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> control, assume the chairmanship of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appropriations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. He also would likely become <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> president pro tempore, the post reserved for the most senior majority member. `` I believe I have been fair, firm and honest, and I have done my best,'' <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> told his fellow Democrats. `` I hope that you agree ... I have led my party from the ambivalence of the Carter years through the extremes of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration ...'' Some Democratic senators privately have criticized <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON>'s leadership style over the years, saying he looked bad on television and did not project well when trying to present the party's position to the Sen. <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> challenged <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> for his position in 1976, but dropped out when it became clear he did not have the votes to win. He criticized <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> at that time for appearing to be out of step with the times. There had been rumors that <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> senators in 1986 that if re-elected to the leadership post he would not seek it again. Those rumors were never confirmed. <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> told reporters he had `` absolutely no doubt'' that he could have won again as leader had he chosen to run. <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> said that as chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Appropriations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, which provides money for all federal programs, he would be able to help his state of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, which he said has suffered under the administration's economic policies. However, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Arch </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> criticized <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON>'s decision, saying <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> would have more influence as majority leader than as appropriations chairman and that the change was unlikely to benefit his state `` Moving down to the chairmanship of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appropriations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> is very significant, and I would be hard-pressed to suggest that West Virginians will notice any difference as a result of the change,'' the Republican governor said in a statement. The majority leader of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> is that chamber's chief strategist and controlling party spokesman. He sets the agenda. <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON>'s decision drew immediate announcements from three <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> senators _ <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Inouye </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Johnston </PERSON> _ that they will seek the leadership post. <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> will decide the issue in a party tally to be held after next November's election. Several senators said there is no clear front-runner. `` This is Senator <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON>'s day,'' said <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>. `` The emphasis ought to be on his contribution.'' Asked whether he will seek the top job, <PERSON> Inouye </PERSON> said, `` Yes, I will,'' and added that he believes his prospects are `` very good.'' <PERSON> Inouye </PERSON> said he did not believe lingering criticism over his performance as chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Iran-Contra </ORGANIZATION> investigating committee last summer would pose an obstacle to his bid. Some Democratic senators have complained, mostly privately, that Marine Lt. Col. <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON> was permitted to steal the show. One senator who had been thought a possible candidate, Sen. <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> Bumpers </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ark </LOCATION>., said he would not make the race Senate Republican Leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> said <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> had earned a special place in history as `` the grand master of <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> rules and procedure.'' `` He is one tough ball carrier for his party,'' <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said. `` He's a senator's senator.'' Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Kerry </PERSON>, D-Mass., said that while <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> himself had provided solid leadership, `` this institution will find new leaders There is a very competent group of people running.'' Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Melcher </PERSON>, D-Mont., said the announcement `` was not unexpected The likelihood of his running again seemed to fade over the past year. The Democrats will seek a new leader now, and go on from there.'' <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON>'s reign has been marked by his mastery of <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> rule and a somewhat dry, if verbose, leadership style. Insider grumbling about his leadership qualities has grown over the years. Sen. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Lautenberg </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.J. </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> has been `` a very effective leader.'' He added, however, that `` what we'll be looking for in the leader is perhaps someone with less knowledge of the process, but hopefully able to do it differently ... the time for change I think is appropriate.,'' Sen. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, D-Mass., said: `` I have all the respect for Senator <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> over the time he has served as majority leader and minority He made this judgment for the best interests of the nation and the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>.'' Since he first entered the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> in 1958, <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> forged a reputation as a courtly master strategist who revered the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and its history and gained power inch-by-inch by attending to his colleagues' smallest wishes. Orphaned at an early age, <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> was raised by an aunt and uncle in the impoverished coal country of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>. He graduated first in his class in high school, but he had to work 12 years at such jobs as gas station attendant, grocery store clerk and butcher before he could afford to attend college. <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON>'s prowess as a country fiddle player helped his campaign for the state legislature in 1946, and since then he has never lost an election. After three House terms, <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> won a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> seat, rising in party ranks by using his posts to do legislative and personal favors. In 1971, <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> called in those favors and ousted <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> for the No. 2 party post of assistant leader. He became a loyal aide to Majority Leader <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Mansfield </PERSON>, and succeeded him in 1976. With the 1980 loss of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> to the Republicans, <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> lost his position and became minority leader. In that role, <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> led Democratic opposition to a highly popular Republican president. But <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> returned in triumph when the Democrats swept the 1986 elections, recapturing majority rule in the 100th <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>.

 Moslem guerrillas killed the vice commander of the Afghan army's central corps in an attack in the western province of <LOCATION> Parwan </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Kabul </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday. In <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, meanwhile, a <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> official told a visiting Italian government delegation that the <ORGANIZATION> Kremlin </ORGANIZATION> will remove 50,000 troops from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> during a three-month period beginning May 15, a source said. The statement by First Deputy Foreign Minister <PERSON> Yuli </PERSON> <PERSON> Vorontsov </PERSON> appeared to be the first time an official source gave any indication of the size of the Soviet force backing the Afghan government. Official <ORGANIZATION> Kabul </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> said Brig. Gen. <PERSON> Aqa </PERSON> <PERSON> Shah </PERSON> was assaulted by `` extremist opposition elements'' _ a reference to the guerrillas _ in the town of <LOCATION> Pul </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mattak </LOCATION>. He later died of his wounds, it said, without giving a date. He was buried Tuesday along with several victims of a passenger plane shot down by guerrillas on Sunday, said <ORGANIZATION> Kabul </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION>, monitored in <LOCATION> Islamabad </LOCATION>. Defense and <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> officials attended the funeral in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>, it said.

<TEXT>
 In the dry, dusty South African outback, an elderly woman creates an outdoor sculpture garden filled with strange and wondrous things _ camels, wise men, owls, pyramids, a <PERSON> Buddha </PERSON>, mermaids, peacocks, even a mosque made of beer bottles. She calls it her `` Mecca,'' and it is the catalyst for `` The Road to <LOCATION> Mecca </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Athol </PERSON> <PERSON> Fugard </PERSON>'s astonishing and affecting new play which opened Tuesday at off-Broadway's Promenade Theater. <PERSON> Fugard </PERSON> is the South African playwright best known for such works as `` Blood Knot'' and `` Master <PERSON> Harold </PERSON>... and the boys.'' They deal with the pervasiveness of apartheid as well as the necessity and inevitability of seeing everything in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> in terms of black and white. `` The Road to <LOCATION> Mecca </LOCATION>,'' with its three white characters, touches on an apartheid of a different sort. It concerns an adventurous artist named Miss <PERSON> Helen </PERSON>, at odds with and cut off from the rigid and unyielding Afrikaners around her. It's her eccentric art work that severs her from society. Miss <PERSON> Helen </PERSON> stands at the center of a battle between <PERSON> Marius </PERSON>, a staid minister, and <PERSON> Elsa </PERSON>, an embittered, frustrated English teacher. <PERSON> Marius </PERSON> feels Miss <PERSON> Helen </PERSON> should move to a retirement home, while the teacher champions the woman's right to remain where she is and create her exotic statues. The fight for control of Miss <PERSON> Helen </PERSON>'s life and artistic spirit takes a while to develop. <PERSON> Fugard </PERSON> does n't rush his story. He examines each member of this trio with sensitivity and care. Act 1 focuses on the two women. Their relationship is the most interesting aspect of the play. The younger woman admires Miss <PERSON> Helen </PERSON>'s independence, her ability to pursue what she wants, regardless of the consequences. The older woman relishes the companionship of the young teacher whose enthusiasm she admires. The minister comes between them in the second act, a powerful explosion of drama that leads to a heartfelt and hopeful conclusion. <PERSON> Fugard </PERSON>'s mastery of language is never more evident than near the end of Act 2 when Miss <PERSON> Helen </PERSON> explains how she came back to life after a loveless marriage ended. <PERSON> Yvonne </PERSON> <PERSON> Bryceland </PERSON>, who plays Miss <PERSON> Helen </PERSON>, is a revelation. The South African-born actress originally was rejected by Actors Equity from performing in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> because it felt she was n't an actress of international stature. Her performance confirms how wrong the union was. The actress, dressed in a gray gunnysack of a dress, commands the stage with her ingratiating smile and honey-combed voice. At first, she projects a childlike enthusiasm but the demeanor is deceptive. Gradually, the woman's crisis of faith is revealed, and the iron will behind her infectious laugh comes through. <PERSON> Fugard </PERSON>, who also directed in a careful, deliberate manner, offers a controlled performance as the rigid clergyman. He has a difficult task _ to portray a sympathetic antagonist who is as much a victim as he is a villain. <PERSON> Amy </PERSON> <PERSON> Irving </PERSON> starts on too strong a note as the volatile teacher, and then has nowhere to go. It's an emotional, showy role, but the part demands more shading than the actress gives it. Miss <PERSON> Helen </PERSON>'s Mecca is never actually seen on stage but a glimpse of its glories is offered in designer <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Beatty </PERSON>'s approximation of the woman's living room: Her home literally glitters with the artist's handiwork, lighted by <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Parichy </PERSON> The play ends on a reaffirmation of life, a reaffirmation by the aging artist that recognizes the darkness while celebrating the light. With Miss <PERSON> Bryceland </PERSON> as a most entrancing free spirit, `` The Road to Mecca'' soars above every other play in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>.

 The development of high definition TV offers <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> industry a chance to improve the trade imbalance for consumer electronics products, according to a government report released Tuesday. The report by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telecommunications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, a <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> agency, estimates the total potential <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> sales of high definition TV equipment at more than $ 150 billion by the year 2010. `` The message of the report is that there is a huge amount of money at stake and the strength of the consumer electronics industry as well,'' said <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sikes </PERSON>, head of <ORGANIZATION> NTIA </ORGANIZATION>, in releasing the report on the final day of the four-day <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasters </ORGANIZATION> annual convention here. Advanced television technology, including high definition TV, was a hot topic at this year's convention, and most of the dozen or so competing systems under development were demonstrated. The technology produces clearer images with more brilliant colors on a wider TV screen. Broadcasters are concerned that a Japanese lead in developing a high definition technology could put them at a competitive disadvantage to cable TV, video cassette recorders and satellite distribution systems if the Japanese system, which is not compatible with existing <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> television sets, takes hold in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Sikes </PERSON> said he anticipates that HDTV will follow the same path as color television sets and video cassette recorders, though he said he could not predict how fast sales of HDTV equipment will grow. `` That will turn on general economic conditions, prices of equipment and the availability of software,'' he said. The report, however, says that if HDTV sales grow as fast as color receivers and VCRs, the new products would find their way into about 1 percent of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> households by 1997 and grow to 93.9 percent in 2008, when total sales of HDTV equipment would reach $ 144 billion. The potential sales are `` immense,'' the report said, and `` substantial participation by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> manufacturers'' in this developing market could help restore balance in the trade and federal budget deficits. The debate over HDTV development in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has been over deciding on an industry transmission standard. <PERSON> Sikes </PERSON> said he believes a standard can be agreed upon by 1991.

 <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION> train No. 392 left <LOCATION> Carbondale </LOCATION> at mid-afternoon as usual, but when it pulled into <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>'s Union Station about seven hours later, five people were dead after two collisions with the locomotive, authorities said Tuesday. A young Southern Illinois couple and two of their children died Monday when their car turned off a parallel road near <LOCATION> Effingham </LOCATION> and crossed the track in front of the train about 90 minutes into its run, police and <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION> officials said. About 3 -LCB- hours later, a 20-year-old woman was killed when her car skirted horizontal crossing gates and struck the train near <LOCATION> Kankakee </LOCATION>, about 60 miles south of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, officials said. `` You do n't forget things like this. ... You get the shakes,'' said engineer T.B. <PERSON> Parker </PERSON>, who was operating the train when the second crash occurred. None of the train's more than 50 passengers was injured, said <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Debbie </PERSON> <PERSON> Marciniak </PERSON>. She said the two train drivers were not responsible for the deaths. `` They were powerless to avoid the accidents, and no disciplinary action is planned,'' she said. Ms. <PERSON> Marciniak </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Railroad </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> had contacted <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION> operations personnel Tuesday about the accidents. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Loftus </PERSON>, a spokesman for the agency in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, said he was unaware of any investigation but that his agency might have called to make sure no federal railroad laws had been violated. The victims of the first accident were identified as <PERSON> Cecil </PERSON> <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Chandler </PERSON>, 26, of <PERSON> La </PERSON> <PERSON> Clede </PERSON>; his wife, <PERSON> Brenda </PERSON>, 25; their 4-year-old daughter, <PERSON> Kerry </PERSON>, and 3-year-old son, <PERSON> Carl </PERSON>, said state Police Sgt. <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Boldrey </PERSON>. <PERSON> Parker </PERSON> said fireman <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON>, 55, was driving when the run began. They both saw the Chandler car turn off a parallel road and head slowly toward the track. <PERSON> Parker </PERSON> said he did not believe the family saw the train at the crossing, marked with a crossing symbol but no gate or lights. `` I could see the female occupant of the car, and she never looked at us. ... I thought I saw the woman holding a child. `` Mr. <PERSON> White </PERSON> had already applied the brakes,'' <PERSON> Parker </PERSON> said. `` He started blowing the whistle. Then we put the brakes in emergency, but it was too late.'' He said the engine had been traveling about 76 mph and came to a halt one-third of a mile down the track. Ms. <PERSON> Marciniak </PERSON> said she did not know what the authorized speed limit was in that area but said the train was traveling within it. `` There was nothing the guy could have done to stop it,'' Ms. <PERSON> Marciniak </PERSON> said of the train's driver. She said the car exploded on impact. <PERSON> Chandler </PERSON>, an unemployed saw-mill worker, and his wife had three other children, said <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Pagel </PERSON>, owner of <ORGANIZATION> Pagel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Funeral </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Edgewood </LOCATION>. The train was delayed about an hour and then headed north again, with <PERSON> Parker </PERSON> taking the controls about halfway through the 300 mile run _ a routine switch. The train passed through <LOCATION> Kankakee </LOCATION> after dark at the maximum 79 mph when the railway men saw a car approach rapidly from the west, <PERSON> Parker </PERSON> said. `` The crossing signals were working, the gates were down, and we were blowing the whistle,'' he said. But the car moved into the left lane as if to bypass the gates, <PERSON> Parker </PERSON> said. The vehicle struck the train's front wheels, causing what he described as `` a minor jolt'' that destroyed the compact car. <PERSON> Annette </PERSON> <PERSON> Hanshew </PERSON>, who lived outside <PERSON> Bourbonnais </PERSON>, died in the crash, said Deputy <LOCATION> Kankakee </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Coroner <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gessner </PERSON>. Last year, <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> ranked second in the nation with 481 accidents at rail crossings, Ms. <PERSON> Marciniak </PERSON> said, behind <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> with 625.

 A federal judge refused Tuesday to overrule a ban ordered by the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> last month on the use of padded shoes on Tennessee Walking Horses. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Court Judge <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> Gasch </PERSON> denied breeders and displayers of the high-gait show horses a temporary restraining order to lay aside Agriculture Secretary <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lyng </PERSON>'s order prohibiting the use of the 4-inch-thick pads on the horses' front hooves. <PERSON> Lyng </PERSON> issued the order on March 25 after <PERSON> Gasch </PERSON> had ruled four days earlier that the department's present regulations allowing use of the pads to accent the breed's high gait violated the 1970 Horse Protection Act. The 1970 law was intended to eliminate the practice of `` soring'' _ using chemicals or devices to accent a horse's gait through the infliction of pain to the animal _ in the <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Walker </LOCATION> industry. Whether the 4-inch pads, sometimes called stacks, `` sore'' or cause pain to a horse has been a legal dispute in <PERSON> Gasch </PERSON>'s court for the past four years through a suit by the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Horse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Gasch </PERSON> described the pads, which effectively elevate the front of a horse and thus shift its weight to its rear legs, as being similar to high-heeled shoes that a women might decide to quit wearing because they hurt her feet. `` The horses, however, do n't seem to have a choice,'' he added. The <ORGANIZATION> Tennessee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Walking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Horse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Breeder </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> and a new group called Friends of the Show Horse formed in response to <PERSON> Lyng </PERSON>'s ruling had petitioned <PERSON> Gasch </PERSON> for the restraining order <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Harmon </PERSON>, an attorney for the latter group, argued that <PERSON> Lyng </PERSON> had overstepped the judge's March 25 ruling by immediately implementing the ban instead of going through the normal, lengthy process of rewriting the regulations after first holding hearings and seeking comments. The <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, which had defended its present regulations and agreed with the breeders that the pads were legal, has started that process of redrafting them. But in the interim, it is prohibiting the padded shoes. <PERSON> Harmon </PERSON> said <PERSON> Lyng </PERSON>'s action caused the immediate cancellation of 11 <ORGANIZATION> Tennessee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Walking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Horse </ORGANIZATION> shows and threatens another 24 scheduled between now and the end of April around the country. `` It's like <LOCATION> Pearl </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Shelbyville </LOCATION>,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON>, D-Tenn., whose district includes the town that is site to the annual Tennessee Walking Horse National Celebration, the industry's largest <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> estimated that the show held each year just prior to Labor Day pumps about $ 35 million into the <LOCATION> Shelbyville </LOCATION> area's economy `` It's the flashy, fast-gaited horses that draw the crowds,'' he said. `` People in the business tell me the horses without pads are not as exciting,'' However, <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON> <PERSON> Rice </PERSON>, who owns a small stable of <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> Walkers in <LOCATION> Fairfax </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, said she is now showing five horses that have never had pads put on their hooves. `` They do n't need to use them,'' she said of the devices. `` It just makes it easier and quicker to train them. And for people running large farms, that means they can just run that many more horses through.''

Lt. <PERSON> Bert </PERSON> <PERSON> Jenkins </PERSON> said <PERSON> Hale </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Jean </PERSON>, found <PERSON> Hale </PERSON>, 47, shot in the head in the laundry room of his home. <PERSON> Hale </PERSON>, of <PERSON> Cabot </PERSON>, was suspended as chief pending the outcome of his trial on a charge of theft of less than $ 200 from a cash register in a Little Rock drug store. He was arrested March 10 outside the store. <PERSON> Hale </PERSON>'s trial was to begin May 24 in <ORGANIZATION> Pulaski </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. He pleaded innocent to the charge March 11 and was released on his own recognizance. In a statement, <LOCATION> Little </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rock </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> Manager <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Dalton </PERSON> said the gunshot wound `` appears to be self-inflicted.'' `` Our entire city is shocked and stunned as we share this tragedy and sorrow,'' <PERSON> Dalton </PERSON> said. `` We extend our deepest sympathy to <PERSON> Doc </PERSON>'s family.'' <PERSON> Hale </PERSON> was charged after state police made secret videotapes in the store, which is a favorite hangout for local politicians and police. Chief Deputy <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> Lonoke </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> sheriff's office said notes on several sheets from a yellow legal pad were found in <PERSON> Hale </PERSON>'s residence, but he did not know the contents. However, Sheriff <PERSON> J.O </PERSON>. <PERSON> Isaac </PERSON> said Tuesday night that <PERSON> Hale </PERSON> did n't leave any note that would explain his death `` There was not a note found in the vicinity of where the body was. Any businessman or law officer keeps notes and that's what these were,'' <PERSON> Isaac </PERSON> said of the sheets from the legal pad. <PERSON> Isaac </PERSON> said he expected results of an autopsy conducted late Tuesday would be released Wednesday by the state <ORGANIZATION> Crime </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratory </ORGANIZATION>. The sheriff said he would not know until then whether <PERSON> Hale </PERSON>'s death was a suicide. He said tests were also being conducted on a pistol _ not <PERSON> Hale </PERSON>'s service revolver _ that was found near the body Radio station <ORGANIZATION> KARN </ORGANIZATION>, quoting sources who insisted on anonymity, reported late Tuesday that a settlement of the <PERSON> Hale </PERSON> case was being negotiated.

 An 11-year-old boy was taken into welfare custody Tuesday after he disappeared for six days, apparently with a neighbor woman who his mother claims was infatuated with the youngster. The woman allegedly involved, 37-year-old <PERSON> Janette </PERSON> <PERSON> Buckley </PERSON>, was arrested by detectives at a house at <ORGANIZATION> Peterborough </ORGANIZATION> 75 miles north of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> on Tuesday night. Detectives later took her for questioning to <PERSON> Corby </PERSON>, where she and the boy were neighbors, <ORGANIZATION> Northamptonshire </ORGANIZATION> police said in a statement. <PERSON> Corby </PERSON> is 20 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Peterborough </LOCATION>. Mrs. <PERSON> Buckley </PERSON>, who is married and has five children, disappeared from her home in <LOCATION> Corby </LOCATION> at about the same time April 6 that schoolboy <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Burgess </PERSON> disappeared from his home a few doors away, according to <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, the domestic news agency. Welfare workers took <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> into their care Tuesday after he telephoned police from <LOCATION> Kettering </LOCATION>, 60 miles north of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, and then made his way about 10 miles north to the <LOCATION> Corby </LOCATION> police station. <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON>'s mother, <PERSON> Kathleen </PERSON> <PERSON> Burgess </PERSON>, was quoted by the agency as saying, `` I saw this unhealthy friendship developing over the past year and warned <PERSON> Janet </PERSON> to stop it. ... She has taken the love and affection of my son and I thought she was my friend. `` They just got too close and I warned her to leave him alone but she would n't listen,'' she said. The agency quoted neighbors as saying Mrs. <PERSON> Buckley </PERSON> was `` completely besotted'' with the boy.

 Palestinians and <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> troops clashed in the occupied territories Tuesday while Arabs accused of inciting violence fought deportation orders through the courts. More than two dozen Palestinians were injured by rubber bullets or tear gas in scattered protests in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, army sources said. Palestinians in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> village of <LOCATION> Beita </LOCATION>, where an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> teen-ager was killed last week, said they feared retaliation by Jewish settlers once the army lifts a curfew, but insisted Arabs were not to blame for the girl's death. In <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>'s Jabaliya refugee camp, troops shot rubber bullets and live ammunition to disperse a demonstration near a military building, Palestinian reporters said. An army helicopter hovered above the Beach camp, also in the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, firing tear gas grenades and gravel at the protesters, <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> reported. The army clamped a curfew on the Beach camp and its 42,000 residents. One resident, <PERSON> Hassan </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahmoud </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaoud </PERSON>, 21, reportedly perished Tuesday. Arab sources told the <ORGANIZATION> Itim </ORGANIZATION> news agency he died after inhaling tear gas on Monday. Army sources said 10 <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> residents suffered beating injuries, four were hurt by rubber bullets and 10 suffered tear gas inhalation. They said one <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> was wounded by a regular bullet. <PERSON> Ahli </PERSON> <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> hospital officials in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> identified the victim as a 12-year-old boy and said he had a gunshot wound in his left arm. In the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> village of <LOCATION> Asira </LOCATION> <LOCATION> esh </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Shamaliya </LOCATION> near <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION>, two Palestinians were wounded in clashes with troops when residents blocked the road and stoned a bus transporting soldiers, the army reported. It said an army officer was injured when he was hit by a rock. A virturally total commercial strike was observed in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>, but many <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> workers left for work in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> media reports said. Three of twelve Palestinians who received deportation notices on Monday appealed the orders to a military tribunal, <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> reported. The rest said they plan to appeal. Eight Palestinians were deported to <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> Monday. Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> said the Jewish state will continue `` to build the kingdom of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'' and threatened to deport more Palestinian activists. <PERSON> Beita </PERSON>'s 6,000 residents are living under a dusk-to-dawn curfew. Soldiers patrol the village, which is surrounded by thick groves of olive, fig and almond trees. Troops guard the village entrance. The army has ordered the deportation of six residents. Hundreds have been detained, and <PERSON> Beita </PERSON> residents said 60 were still being held Tuesday. `` This is an act of retaliation against us, against the whole village,'' said <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON> <PERSON> Hassan </PERSON> <PERSON> Salman </PERSON>, 27. `` It is a collective punishment to satisfy the settlers' demands. A settler killed the girl _ and they are punishing us.'' Villagers said no Arabs were involved in the shooting of 15-year-old <PERSON> Tirza </PERSON> <PERSON> Porat </PERSON> on April 6, but they said the army has destroyed 16 of their homes. Initial army reports said the girl was stoned to death by Arabs while hiking through <PERSON> Beita </PERSON>, 35 miles north of <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, with a group of Jewish teen-agers and two armed guards. Enraged Jewish settlers screamed for revenge and attacked Arab homes and cars. After an autopsy, the army concluded that <PERSON> Tirza </PERSON> was accidentally shot by one of the Israeli guards. <PERSON> Tirza </PERSON> was the first Israeli civilian to die since unrest broke out Dec. 8 in the occupied territories <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> seized in the 1967 <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> war. According to <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> figures, 143 Palestinians have died. On Israeli soldier also was killed. <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Pickering </PERSON> expressed concern over Israeli tactics in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, specifically deportations, administrative detentions and house demolitions. He told an audience at <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Hebrew </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> that it was essential that basic concepts of due process be observed. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s deputy chief of staff, Gen. <PERSON> Ehud </PERSON> <PERSON> Barak </PERSON>, told Israeli newspapers reserve soldiers would be called up for 62 days a year instead of the usual 40 to cope with violence in the occupied territories. <PERSON> Barak </PERSON> also said there were five times as many troops serving in the occupied territories than a year ago due to recent unrest, the Hadashot daily reported. He declined to give a figure in keeping with military policy.

 <PERSON> Edgar </PERSON> and <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Simionescu </PERSON> lived the simplest of lives in the most complex of times, quiet men in a quiet town measuring their wealth in their devotion to each other. Few people noted the passing of <PERSON> Edgar </PERSON> and <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> two years ago, three months apart, in the brown shingled house where they spent 90 years. They outlived almost everyone who ever knew them. They might have faded away completely, side by side in <LOCATION> Hackensack </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cemetery </LOCATION>, the fragments of their lives preserved only in bits of paper in the <LOCATION> Bergen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Courthouse </LOCATION>, but for the matter of their will, <ORGANIZATION> Hackensack </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> and a pile of money. That bit of paper turned the simple story of <PERSON> Edgar </PERSON> and <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> into <LOCATION> Hackensack </LOCATION> legend. The sons of a Romanian head waiter at a <LOCATION> Wall </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Street </LOCATION> restaurant arrived in <LOCATION> Hackensack </LOCATION> in 1896. The family moved to a large frame house on <ORGANIZATION> Sussex </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Street </ORGANIZATION>, not far from the site of the first <ORGANIZATION> Hackensack </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, built a year later for $ 12,000. <PERSON> Edgar </PERSON>, the eldest, attended the school for a year in 1904. By the time his brother, <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON>, entered in 1909, the brick building was already bursting with students and plans were in the works for a new high school. <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> left two years later, and <PERSON> Max </PERSON>, the family baby, was the only <PERSON> Simionescu </PERSON> to attend the new school completed in 1918 and the only brother to graduate. <PERSON> Max </PERSON> became an accountant and married <PERSON> Kathleen </PERSON> <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON>, a girl he met while working summers at an uncle's ice cream stand at the <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> shore. <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> was stricken with polio at age 17, and the paralysis left him wheelchair-bound for the rest of his life. <PERSON> Edgar </PERSON> became a machinist and was drafted into the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>'s horse cavalry in World War I. He had served only a couple of months when the war ended, and he never again ventured far from the house on <LOCATION> Sussex </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Street </LOCATION> or from <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON>'s side. For years, <PERSON> Edgar </PERSON> had <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> and <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> had his stamp collection, and they both had <PERSON> Max </PERSON>, who always called them `` the boys'' even though he was at least 10 years younger, and even after they were all over 70. In the summer, <PERSON> Max </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kathleen </PERSON> invited the boys to their home for picnics. <PERSON> Edgar </PERSON> was the cut-up, the extrovert, always looking for attention. <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> was more serious, more thoughtful. `` They were very close. Whatever <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> said, <PERSON> Edgar </PERSON> went along,'' said <PERSON> Matthew </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON>, assistant vice president in the trust department at <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jersey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>, who came to love the brothers like uncles. `` I never heard one raise their voice to the other.'' They lived contentedly, undisturbed. Every day, <PERSON> Edgar </PERSON> helped his brother dress, eased him in and out of his wheelchair and assisted with his stamp orders. <PERSON> Edgar </PERSON> cooked their meals as long as he was able and maintained the house. Even into his 80s, he was fixing things, painting or repairing this or that. He did n't believe in bringing in outsiders. For years, they had a weekly poker game with another pair of brothers, plumbers. Dealer's choice, nickel stakes. They never watched television. All the news worth learning was in the newspaper, <PERSON> Edgar </PERSON> believed, and he would sit in his mother's chair and read it aloud to <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON>, who could n't turn the pages Or he'd lay the paper in front of <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON>, and turn the pages for him. The city shifted and grew around them; public housing projects sprang up on the site of the <ORGANIZATION> Hackensack </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> they had attended, and businesses and warehouses cropped up around their home. Their sister-in-law begged them to move, but they refused. The more <LOCATION> Hackensack </LOCATION> changed, the more <PERSON> Edgar </PERSON> and <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> stayed the same. `` They were happy the way they lived,'' <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> said. `` To our standards, they probably lived frugal lives; to them, they did not. They had enough to eat, clothing, a roof over their heads. They paid their bills.'' Money meant little to the boys; dignity was everything. <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON>'s last wish was that <PERSON> Edgar </PERSON>, whose health and mind were deteriorating, never be placed in a nursing home The night <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> died, at 90, the men from the funeral home almost took away the sleeping <PERSON> Edgar </PERSON>. `` Not yet,'' <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> told them. On their doctor's advice, <PERSON> Edgar </PERSON> was never told of <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON>'s death, but those around him were sure he sensed it He died three months later, at 93. They had some investments, stocks and bonds purchased years ago. Most of the certificates were so old they were handwritten, and some of the companies no longer existed, having long since been swallowed up by others. They never changed securities. That was their philosophy. But the value of their investments changed radically in the last 10 years. By the time <PERSON> Edgar </PERSON> and <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> died, their estate was worth more than $ 1.5 million. The money was left in trust for <ORGANIZATION> Hackensack </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, with direction that the $ 120,000 or so in annual interest be given in college scholarships to its students, based on need. Administrators hope to award the first batch this spring. `` If you or I had a million and a half, 2 million bucks, would you not consider moving into some kind of condo, where you had the elevators, where you had all the services, where you could have the sunshine?'' wondered <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Bloom </PERSON>, principal at <LOCATION> Hackensack </LOCATION> High. `` These men were not frightened men. Why did they stay? They must have loved their community, or their home.'' What they loved most, perhaps, was growing old in a place where they did n't have to open the door when change came knocking, a place where two bachelor brothers could turn quiet lives into an eloquent gift of hope for other people's children. `` We're the family of the Simionescus,'' <PERSON> Bloom </PERSON> said. `` In perpetuity. For generations. That's a nice memorial, is n't it?''

But the men and women at the elegant restaurant are more interested in salmon mousse than sizzling amour. <PERSON> Dalliance </PERSON>, though welcome, is not the goal of The Single Gourmet _ a less romantic but frequently more satisfying pleasure lies behind the organization with about 10,000 members in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. `` It's probably the best way to meet people,'' said <PERSON> Art </PERSON> <PERSON> Fischer </PERSON>, who began the club in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> in 1982. `` It's not a dating agency. It's not a matrimonial agency. It's a dining club. We try to bring people together for good food and congenial conversation.'' The organization's recipe, stirred by changes in courtship and fascination with the arts of the kitchen, has been successful. The <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> branch has grown to 2,600 members, and 14 independent chapters have opened in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Fischer </PERSON> said in a telephone interview. Members pay up to $ 75 a year to join The Single Gourmet and $ 25-50, not including wine, for meals at restaurants or on other outings. Most are upper-middle-class professionals _ lawyers, business executives, stockbrokers and doctors, <PERSON> Fischer </PERSON> said. In keeping with the classy, low-key approach, members are not afflicted with name tags, but are identified discreetly at tables of six to 10 with placecards bearing only first names. In <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, about 35 members of The Single Gourmet recently enjoyed salmon tortellini, pear and parsnip soup, lamb with couscous and other specialities of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> cuisine at Cafe Majestic, a popular restaurant in a restored Victorian hotel. `` I've wanted to come to this restaurant ever since it opened, but I never dared come by myself,'' said <PERSON> Jenny </PERSON>, 49, a medical secretary. `` So this is a real option for me.'' The chapter, about 18 months old, has about 270 members in the <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> area. One member travels from <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> to attend its dinners, winery tours and other functions, which occur about twice a month. Some regulars simply find The Single Gourmet a way to fit a social life into their busy schedules. `` It forces you to go out. For instance, I would not on a Tuesday night go out to Cafe Majestic or someplace like it,'' said <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Sclafani </PERSON>, a designer in his 30s. `` It gives you a nice experience trying different restaurants and lets you experiment without, as a single man, having to go out on a date,'' he said. Others, like <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Sternitzke </PERSON>, first used the club as a way to learn about good restaurants and find friends in a new city. He was hooked when he ended up belly dancing at a <LOCATION> Moroccan </LOCATION> restaurant at the first Single Gourmet dinner he attended a year and a half ago. <PERSON> Sternitzke </PERSON>, 35, credits the club for introducing him _ a native of the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> raised on `` meat-and-potatoes stuff'' _ to culinary adventure. `` I've tasted food I ca n't even say,'' he said. `` And I've tried food when I've asked them not to tell me what it is until I've eaten it. But all the diners agreed they had n't joined The Single Gourmet as a singles club or dating service. `` I just enjoy meeting people. If it was single and married people, I'd probably join then, too,'' said <PERSON> Jeanne </PERSON> <PERSON> Swift </PERSON>, who began attending dinners six months ago. <PERSON> Jenny </PERSON>, who declined to give her last name, said sex was n't a factor in the civilized pleasure of enjoying food with others. `` When you're eating lovely food, you want to look across the table and say, ` This is wonderful; you must have a taste,''' she said. `` I do n't care if it's with men or women.'' But changing sexual behavior has definitely helped The Single Gourmet, members and coordinators said. `` It just seemed like an idea that came at the right time,'' <PERSON> Fischer </PERSON> said. `` It was the time -LRB- the novel and movie -RRB- ` Looking for Mr. <PERSON> Goodbar </PERSON>' was giving singles bars and discos a bad name. ... You almost had to make up your mind about someone on eye contact. That's hardly the way to get to know somebody.'' But while people may not be looking for love when they join, sometimes they find it anyway. The <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> chapter has seen 28 marriages of club members in six years, <PERSON> Fischer </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Fischer </PERSON>, a retired film importer, owns The Single Gourmet name and sells licenses for branches, which operate independently although members may attend dinners and other Single Gourmet events in other cities.

<HEAD>As Bishops Begin Periodic Visits, Rome Seems Mellow</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE W. CORNELL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bishops making obligatory treks to <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> are finding that Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> is happier with their church than some had supposed. Nevertheless, their representatives have been summoned for a special meeting next year with him about the whole situation. Indications had arisen in several recent diciplinary cases of strains between the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> and this country's Catholicism, including <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON>'s rebuke to dissent on his visit last year. But as the bishops began their once-every-five years `` ad limina'' visits, the <PERSON> pope </PERSON> was said to seem highly upbeat about the state of the American church. He `` seems to have a very strong, postitive estimate of the church in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> since his trip,'' says Archbishop <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> May </PERSON> of <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bishops </ORGANIZATION>. `` I got the impression he was a little irked by people who had filled him with all kinds of warnings and apprehensions,'' May said. He said the bishops welcome a special meeting with the pope next year, an unusual summit session <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> announced last month to 21 Midwestern bishops at the close of their group's visit. They were the first a series of such callers to continue through October in which all the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bishops, in rotation, visit the pope. In interviews with the initial returning group from <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> Reporter said they were elated by the `` open and warm atmosphere'' of the meetings. `` Several said they were apprehensive going in but left with a far greater sense that the pontiff supports the thrust and direction of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Catholicism,'' the paper summarized. They `` said the <PERSON> pope </PERSON> left them with the distinct impression he thought he had been ill-served by some in <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> who had painted a dire image of <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> life in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> ... `` To the contrary, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> said he found an energetic and faithful church ... committed to serving the needs of the poor.'' His announcement of the 1989 meeting came as no surprise, as it had been suggested by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bishops last spring. At the time, various concerns about relations with the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> had been brewing, including its ouster of a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, theologian, the Rev. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Curran </PERSON>, and restrictions, later lifted, on <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> Archbishop <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Hunthausen </PERSON>. Those issues have quieted, however, and <PERSON> May </PERSON> said the summit meeting was not focused on any crisis in the church, as have been some such sessions with bishops in <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Holland </LOCATION>. He said the pope never mentioned the rift that has developed among <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bishops over a statement issued in December by their 50-member administrative board on AIDs, but that it was discussed with Vatican doctrinal officials. They expressed `` concern about the apparent disagreement'' among bishops about the document, he said. The document emphasized pre-marital chastity and fidelity in marriage, but some bishops objected to its tolerating information about condoms in public education about AIDs. Meanwhile, with the number of active <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> cardinals down to three, speculation rose that the pope may soon appoint new ones in this country and elsewhere. Worldwide, there are only 98 cadinals younger than 80, the maximum age for eligibility to vote for a pope, while the minimum number set for that task is 120. Among the leading prospects for `` red hats'' in this country are Archbishops <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Hickey </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahoney </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Edmund </PERSON> <PERSON> Szoka </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> and May. However, retired cardinals still are living in <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, and the usual custom is not to name another in their sees in their lifetimes. <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> also has a retired cardinal, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Krol </PERSON>, but he stepped down only last year, and his replacement, Archbishop <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bevilacqua </PERSON>, is likely considered too new on the job for elevation now. Other possibilities are <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION> Archbishop <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Roach </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION> Archbishop <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Borders </PERSON>, although their progressive leanings may be against them, and Archbishop <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Flores </PERSON> of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Russian Folk Tales in Jim Henson's `The Storyteller'</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Over the ages, storytellers have bridged generational and geographical boundaries by retelling folk tales, usually invoking some magic of their own to highlight their talents and suit the audience. Continuing the tradition in the TV age is <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Henson </PERSON>, creator of `` Fraggle Rock,'' `` The Muppet Show'' and <PERSON> Kermit </PERSON> the Frog and Big Bird on `` Sesame Street.'' Borrowing a monster here, blending in a few fairy tales there, <PERSON> Henson </PERSON> has been delighting even the crustiest of curmudgeons with `` The Storyteller,'' a series of half-hour specials on <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>. The fourth installment, `` The Luck Child,'' airs Saturday. For `` The Luck Child,'' <PERSON> Henson </PERSON> has borrowed a griffin from the brothers <PERSON> Grimm </PERSON> and blended elements of some early Russian folk tales. The show's magic is seamless thanks to the witty script by British playwright <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Minghella </PERSON>, and, of course, the Muppet mutations. The 14-foot-tall talking griffin -LRB- a thinking man's <LOCATION> Big </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bird </LOCATION> _ it claims to be misunderstood -RRB- is one of the biggest bunches of wood, wire and widgets ever created in the London-based Muppet `` creature shop.'' With some high tech and human help, the people-eating, havoc-wreaking beast is brought to life by <PERSON> Henson </PERSON>'s 24-year-old son, <PERSON> Brian </PERSON>. `` Performing the griffin on a small platform inside its neck, throwing my body out at different angles was sort of like being in an aerobics class,'' said <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Henson </PERSON>. On a smaller scale, he also `` performs'' the storyteller's talking dog with an assistant, a tiny TV monitor, a computer and 13 thimble-size motors controlling the dog's facial movements He says the dog, a stylized blend of breeds, `` has a hard edge, intended to play against the lecturing style of the narrator,'' played by British actor <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Hurt </PERSON> in the title role. `` The Luck Child'' borrows elements from `` The Lucky Child'' and `` Marco the Rich and <PERSON> Vasily </PERSON> the Luckless'' in a collection by <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Afanasev </PERSON>. A Russian ethnographer and lawyer, he published more than 600 native folk tales in the mid-1800s, becoming the Russian counterpart to the brothers <PERSON> Grimm </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. `` The Luck Child'' also contains elements of <PERSON> Grimm </PERSON>'s `` The Griffin'' and `` The Devil with Three Golden Hairs.'' A peasant child is born and, according to a prophecy, he will one day rule the land, whose current leader tries to do away with him. But the luck child survives, after tricking the griffin. The sponsors hope viewers will look for more stories like `` The Luck Child'' in books. One of the show's sponsors, <ORGANIZATION> Clorox </ORGANIZATION>, also is a sponsor of the national, non-profit literacy organization, Reading Is Fundamental, which has distributed 78 million books to children since 1966. It's a rare event: a prime-time network sponsor hoping you'll read more books! One such book could be `` Folk Tales of the Amur'' -LRB- <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> -RRB-, which includes 31 stories from the Russian far east. Another is <PERSON> Afanasev </PERSON>'s collection, `` Russian Fairy Tales'' -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Random </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> -RRB-. The Afanasev book is a standard, according to <PERSON> Alex </PERSON> <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Slavic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> at <ORGANIZATION> Hunter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and an expert on Russian folklore. It includes Russian versions of universal fairy-tale figures as well as the Firebird, the witch <PERSON> Baba </PERSON> <PERSON> Yaga </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON> the Terrible. Ironically, Russian tales like these apparently first appeared in written form, not in their homeland in their native tongue, but in <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> in the 1600s after being brought out and translated by foreign travelers. This was mainly because Russian written literature was almost entirely based on church teachings and folk tales were passed by word of mouth. The tradition of borrowing and retelling to suit different nations and storytellers continued when authors such as <PERSON> Gogol </PERSON>, <PERSON> Dostoevski </PERSON> and <PERSON> Tolstoy </PERSON>, incorporated folklore into their works. For example, although <LOCATION> Pushkin </LOCATION> knew Russian folk tales and recorded them, he wrote story poems based for the most part on French translations of the Arabian Nights, <PERSON> Grimm </PERSON> or <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Irving </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Pushkin </PERSON>'s `` Tale of the Golden Cockerel'' is simply a retelling of <PERSON> Irving </PERSON>'s `` Legend of the Arabian Astrologer.'' Yet Russian and <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> readers think it's Russian folklore.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> turns 40 this week, beset by a rebellion among Palestinians who have spent more than half that time under occupation and a wrenching debate on the young nation's future. The Arab uprising in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> has drained much of the joy from a year-long birthday celebration that climaxes April 22, which coincides on the the Hebrew calendar this year with May 14, 1948, the date <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> was founded. A poetry festival and a $ 10 million rock music extravaganza in the <LOCATION> Negev </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Desert </LOCATION> are going ahead but plans to bring singer Barbra Streisand, tennis star <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Evert </PERSON> and the rock group <PERSON> Pink </PERSON> <PERSON> Floyd </PERSON> collapsed. Officials had hoped to demonstrate <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s achievements and acceptance during the anniversary year. Instead, canceled plans and the absence of foreign heads of state underline its vulnerability. Much of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s success has been in developing military power, the result of five wars with neighboring Arab states. For example, it ranks sixth in the world in arms exports, which bring in about $ 1 billion a year. There also is a flourishing cultural life, especially in a range of music from Hebrew punk-rock to that great national cultural achievement, the Israeli Philharmonic. Since Dec. 8, when the violence began, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> has been consumed by the question of what to do with the territories captured from <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> in the 1967 <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> war. For the first time the issue is likely to be the focus of elections, now scheduled for November. Liberal politicians say 20 years of occupation has had a corrosive effect on morality and does not square with being a `` light unto nations'' the goal declared by <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s first prime minister, the late <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Ben-Gurion </PERSON>. <PERSON> Abba </PERSON> <PERSON> Eban </PERSON>, elder statesman of the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, said growth of character has not matched the country's growth in material wealth and military power. `` We anticipated that within a period of 40 years we would have outlived the rhetoric of struggle and resistance and would be moving into some kind of drama and romance in social creativity,'' the former foreign minister said. `` Modern <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> does not owe the same allegiance, debt or devotion to its traditional Jewish character, and it very rarely compares its actions to criteria that come from the Jewish ethical tradition.'' He said democracy was being undermined by the emergency measures of occupation, and the cooperative spirit of pioneer days was being supplanted by materialism. Such misgivings are not shared by the rising star of the conservative <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> bloc, <PERSON> Benyamin </PERSON> <PERSON> Netanyahu </PERSON>, who recently resigned as ambassador to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>. He said <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s success `` borders on the miraculous.'' Half a century ago, <PERSON> Netanyahu </PERSON> said, the Jewish people had crawled from the Holocaust and the possibility of building a national life seemed hopelessly remote. `` Yet in a few years the Jews recovered their homeland, fought off armies that assaulted them, liberated their ancient capital, built a modern economy, theaters, universities and concert halls, and revived an ancient tongue,'' he declared. <PERSON> Netanyahu </PERSON>, whose brother <PERSON> Yonathan </PERSON> was killed leading the daring 1976 rescue of hijacked airline hostages at <LOCATION> Entebbe </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Uganda </LOCATION>, said the Arab threat is undiminished. `` The grim truth remains that the majority of the Arab world still refuses to accept <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s right to exist, and still seeks to wage war against it, war by different means, including the present means of mass violence and media stampede,'' <PERSON> Netanyahu </PERSON> said. In the former ambassador's view, withdrawal from the occupied lands would shrink <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s waist to a 10-mile-wide strip against the sea, with thousands of young Palestinians holding rockets instead of stones. The left believes <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> is strong and secure enough to risk trading land for peace and that greater danger lies in keeping the occupied territories and trying to rule the hostile and rapidly growing popuatlion of 1.5 million Arabs. Palestinian intellectuals attribute the sudden explosion of anger and violence Dec. 8 to three factors: _ The <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> question was ignored by the U.S.-Soviet summit last December and given secondary priority to the Iran-Iraq war at the Arab summit in November _ Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> expressed satisfaction with the status quo and a desire to make the occupied land a permanent part of `` Greater <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> _ Daily frustrations about army rule radicalized younger Arabs A generation of Palestinians has been born and grown to adulthood since 1967, resentful of occupation and less intimidated by the might of the Israeli military. Many also have been attracted to the Moslem fundamentalism spreading through the Arab world One result of these forces has been a young, underground leadership of the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> that has taken charge of the rebellion and is directing it. <PERSON> Saeb </PERSON> <PERSON> Erakat </PERSON>, a political science professor at An <ORGANIZATION> Najah </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, said: `` The uprising is a message to the Israelis, the Americans and the Arabs: We do n't want to become Israeli. We are not a minority, but a people, and therefore we demand our right to self-determination,'' Many Israelis say the Arabs fail to comprehend or accept the historical connection Jews feel to the land. <PERSON> Yehuda </PERSON> <PERSON> Avni </PERSON> immigrated from <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> in 1949 and built the <PERSON> Vered </PERSON> <PERSON> Hagalil </PERSON> ranch near the Sea of <LOCATION> Galilee </LOCATION> with his wife <PERSON> Yona </PERSON>. Across the road from his stable of pure-bred Arabian horses is the ruin of the home of an Israelite who lived about 200 B.C. `` We both picked this site with its beautiful view for our farms,'' said <PERSON> Avni </PERSON>, 60. `` I feel a kind of kinship with him. I feel I am part of a chain. The sense of continuity is something vivid, and it gives depth to my life.'' In <LOCATION> Efrat </LOCATION>, a Jewish settlement eight miles south of <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, Rabbi <PERSON> Shlomo </PERSON> <PERSON> Riskin </PERSON> showed a reporter the rocky hills on which he has founded a community of 300, mostly religious Jews. Seeking to dispel the image of settler as fanatic, <PERSON> Riskin </PERSON> stresses his desire for coexistence with Arabs. The difficulty of achieving it is illustrated by his experience with <PERSON> Majid </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> handyman who taught <PERSON> Riskin </PERSON> Arabic. `` I studied with him a few times a week,'' the rabbi said. `` He had gefilte fish at my home on Friday evening a number of times. We had what I thought were very good relations.'' Then one day a bomb was planted just outside <LOCATION> Efrat </LOCATION> and one of the prime suspects was <PERSON> Majid </PERSON>, who disappeared. `` I teach my children and myself to respect every human being as innocent until proven guilty,'' <PERSON> Riskin </PERSON> said. `` At the same time, I have to make sure that I protect myself.'' The <LOCATION> Arab-Israeli </LOCATION> conflict touches almost every aspect of life, even the 110-piece <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Philharmonic </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Ely </PERSON> <PERSON> Eban </PERSON>, 38, a clarinetist and son of <PERSON> Abba </PERSON> <PERSON> Eban </PERSON>, said the unseen impact was brought home to him when he returned from studying in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, the tempo of life was rapid. `` Whenever I would hear myself playing something here, it always seemed a little fast, a little strident, a little more nervous,'' he said. `` When you live here, there is this rhythm that you take on, and it does affect the music making.''

 Palestinians say a feeling they have been neglected by the world and other Arabs, tough statements from <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and day-by-day frustrations of occupation led to the rebellion in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. The spark was a traffic accident Dec. 8 in which an Israeli army truck killed four Arabs near the <LOCATION> Jabaliya </LOCATION> refugee camp in the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. Tensions were such that <PERSON> Arabs </PERSON> saw it not as an accident but as revenge for the stabbing death in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> two days earlier of <PERSON> Shlomo </PERSON> <PERSON> Sakel </PERSON>, an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> businessman. Anger had been building among Palestinians because they felt abandoned by <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> nations and the world community. The Arab summit at <LOCATION> Amman </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>, in November, and the U.S.-Soviet summit in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> in December, did not give priority to the Palestinian issue. `` It was clear to us that we had been put on the shelf,'' said <PERSON> Saeb </PERSON> <PERSON> Erakat </PERSON>, a political science professor at An <ORGANIZATION> Najah </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>. `` The message -LRB- of the uprising -RRB- is that we do n't wish to become Israelis. We are not a mere community or a minority living in greater <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. We are a people ... and we demand our liberty and our right to self-determination.'' Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> rubbed salt in the wound by noting publicly that the Arab summit put the Iran-Iraq war ahead of the Palestinian issue. He and other right-wing leaders suggested the status quo could continue indefinitely and <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> had a right to keep the lands it captured in the 1967 <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> war. This deepened the bitterness. Palestinian statements became extreme in rejecting negotiations for a peaceful settlement. An example of the harder line could be found in the poetry of <PERSON> Mahmoud </PERSON> <PERSON> Darwish </PERSON>, an Israeli Arab living in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> who had favored Israeli-Palestinian dialogue. Many saw his poem `` Those Who Pass Between Fleeting Words'' as a demand for all of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, not just the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. About the Israelis, it says: `` O those who pass between fleeting words, `` Carry your names, and be gone; `` Rid our time of your hours, and be gone; `` Steal what you will from the blueness of the sea and the sand of memory.'' <PERSON> Sari </PERSON> <PERSON> Nusseibeh </PERSON>, a Palestinian intellectual who advocates a negotiated settlement, said many want all <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> included in a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> state just as some Israelis want all the land for the Jewish state. `` The question is whether both sides are ready to settle for less than what they want,'' he said. `` Are they prepared to settle for some kind of partition of this land?'' He said most Palestinians are ready for a two-state solution, but this feeling is `` like a comet that comes close to the earth. If one wants to use it, one has to grab it while it is there.'' He also cited the cumulative affects of 20 years of occupation on the new generation, noting that half the people of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> are under 20 years old and 77 percent under 28. For them, he said, leadership status is `` determined by how many times you have been in jail, how bad was the interrogation and has anybody in your family died fighting. `` The more ` yeses' to such questions the more of a leader you became within your neighborhood or community,'' he added. As Palestinian militancy grew, the deterrent power of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s army was weakened Palestinians saw Shiite Moslem guerrillas drive the Israelis out of south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> in 1985 with a determined guerrilla campaign. Then, in late November 1987, a Palestinian guerrilla sailed over <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s well-defended northern border with a hang glider and killed six soldiers. Israeli analysts said the attack encouraged Palestinians to challenge the army in the occupied territories.

 Oil futures prices have soared to their highest level so far this year, with the runup stirring inflation fears that pushed interest rates sharply higher in the credit markets. Traders said oil prices rose Monday partly on speculation that <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> would encourage other oil producers to rein in production. The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries' price monitoring committee, which met over the weekend, said it would meet soon with non-OPEC exporters to consider shared production restraints. On the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, the May-delivery contract for <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intermediate </ORGANIZATION>, the benchmark crude oil, jumped $ 1.01 per barrel to close at $ 17.89, its highest level this year. Among refined products traded on the exchange, wholesale heating oil rose 2.42 cents a gallon to 47.88 cents, and wholesale unleaded gasoline rose 2.18 cents a gallon to 50.95 cents. Oil market experts debated whether the gain was sustainable. Some believe the jump in prices may be signaling an end to the recent low-price era in the petroleum business. The sharp run-up had a negative impact on the credit markets, where the yield on the bellwether 30-year <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bond rose to 8.77 percent from 8.68 percent late Friday. The stock market edged slightly higher, extending last week's rally despite some resistance from sellers The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 5.80 to 2,095.99 on top of last week's 102.13-point jump to new closing highs since the crash last fall The dollar rose against most major currencies except the Canadian dollar, while gold prices were mixed.

 <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hanover </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> says it will retain major consumer banking operations even after the proposed sale of its consumer finance unit to a <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> company for $ 685 million cash. Manufacturers Hanover, the nation's sixth-largest bank holding company, said Monday it had agreed in principle to sell the finance unit to <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, a financial services concern. The acquisition, if approved by the boards of both companies, would nearly double the size of Houston-based American General's consumer credit finance operations The transaction also is subject to a definitive agreement being reached. Although the proposed sale would remove one of its major consumer operations, <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hanover </ORGANIZATION> said it would remain a strong player in the consumer market through its Branch Banking Division, a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> area regional bank, and its nationwide credit card operation. Manufacturers Hanover's decision to sell its consumer finance unit, which is based in <LOCATION> Huntingdon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, came as no surprise as it tries to recover from heavy losses absorbed last year when it boosted its loan loss reserve. The bank holding company posted a $ 1.14 billion loss in 1987 as it boosted its loan-loss reserve by $ 1.7 billion in anticipation of problems with some of its Third World loans. Manufacturers Hanover expected a pre-tax gain of about $ 300 million from the proposed sale. `` We are realizing a substantial premium over book value on this well-managed company,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> McGillicuddy </PERSON>, chairman and chief executive of <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hanover </ORGANIZATION>. Manufacturers Hanover's common stock rose 12 -LCB- cents to $ 26 a share and <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> was off 50 cents a share to $ 32.50 on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. American General would make the acquisition through its <ORGANIZATION> Credithrift </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION> Evansville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ind </LOCATION>. The purchase would boost <PERSON> Credithrift </PERSON>'s assets to more than $ 6 billion from $ 3.3 billion and give it a total of 1,400 branch offices in 42 states, <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Virgin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION>. Both <PERSON> Credithrift </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hanover </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Consumer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> market consumer and home equity loans and retail financing services, and have insurance subsidiaries that provide credit-related coverage. <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohn </PERSON>, who follows the banking business for <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, said Manufacturers Hanover appeared to have gotten a good price for the unit and that the sale should not hurt its overall profitability. Manufacturers Hanover said the consumer finance unit earned $ 55.2 million in 1987. <PERSON> Cohn </PERSON> said the company should be able to earn that much in interest on proceeds from the sale. <PERSON> Cohn </PERSON> also said the sale will help Manufacturers Hanover toward its goal of boosting the ratio between shareholder's equity and its assets, a key indicator monitored by federal regulators. Manufacturers Hanover had told shareholders earlier this year that it intended to boost that ratio to 4 percent by the end of 1988 through a combination of stronger operating earnings, $ 400 million in pre-tax gains on the sale of undervalued assets and use of tax benefits. Manufacturers Hanover said the consumer finance sale would add about $ 275 million to shareholders' equity and reduce total assets by about $ 3 billion from $ 73.3 billion at the end of 1987. <PERSON> Cohn </PERSON> figured the sale would boost the equity-to-assets ratio to about 3.32 percent from 2.81 percent at the end of 1987. American General posted a profit of $ 555 million in 1987 and had $ 28 billion in assets. Its Credithrift subsidiary earned $ 68.9 million in 1987. <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hook </PERSON>, chairman and chief executive of <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION>, said the purchase should not dilute <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION>'s earnings and there were no plans to alter the company's previously announced stock repurchase plan American General said it would change the name of its consumer credit segment to <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> upon completion of the deal. In addition to purchase price, <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hanover </ORGANIZATION> said it also would receive a cash dividend of $ 20 million representing the consumer finance unit's earnings between Jan. 1 and the closing of the transaction.

 Interest rates on short-term <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> securities were mixed in the government's latest auction, with rates on three-month bills unchanged and rates on six-month bills edged down slightly. The <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> sold $ 6.4 billion in three-month bills at an average discount rate of 5.98 percent on Monday, the same as last week. Another $ 6.4 billion was sold in six-month bills at an average discount rate of 6.19 percent, down from 6.21 percent last week. The three-month bill rate this week and last was the highest since these bills averaged 6 percent on Dec. 14. The 6.19 percent rate for six-month bills was the lowest since 6 percent on March 28. The new discount rates understate the actual return to investors _ 6.16 percent for three-month bills with a $ 10,000 bill selling for $ 9,848.80 and 6.48 percent for six-month bills selling for $ 9,687.10.

<HEAD>Bidding Continues Escalating For Stevens</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> J.P. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stevens </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> remains the hub of a frenzied bidding contest, with rival suitors <ORGANIZATION> Odyssey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partners </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Point-Pepperell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> each sweetening their buyout offers a third time for the textile giant. Odyssey ended the latest round in the lengthy auction late Monday by raising to $ 1.22 billion, or $ 68.50 a share, the price it is willing to pay under its March 29 agreement to acquire <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>. The sweetened offer by the investment firm came hours after <ORGANIZATION> Pepperell </ORGANIZATION> had raised its cash tender offer for New York-based <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> to $ 1.19 billion, or $ 67 a share for each of <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>' 17.8 million common shares outstanding. In trading on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> stock rose 50 cents a share to close at $ 66.50, indicating speculators were unsure that the heated bidding would move much higher. Odyssey's latest bid, which topped its previous $ 64-a-share offer, worth about $ 1.14 billion, will expire at midnight EDT April 22 unless extended. In addition to sweetening its rival bid, <ORGANIZATION> Pepperell </ORGANIZATION> said it removed major antitrust concerns about its proposal by agreeing with the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> to sell certain <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> assets if its offer succeeds. Analysts had predicted further bidding in the battle for <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>, a leading maker of home textiles such as sheets and towels. But they said the bidding was reaching the upper limits of a reasonable price for the 175-year-old company. `` Based on my expectations for <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>' cash flow this year, and assuming some overhead ... and capital spending could be cut some, it supports a bid of $ 65 a share and not significantly above that,'' said <PERSON> Deborah </PERSON> <PERSON> Bronston </PERSON>, an analyst at <ORGANIZATION> Prudential-Bache </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lanier </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Pepperell </LOCATION>'s chairman and chief executive officer, said in an interview that he considered $ 1.19 billion a fair price But he said the company would have to `` consider our options'' if Odyssey increased its bid. <LOCATION> Pepperell </LOCATION> had no comment late Monday on whether it would initiate yet another round of bidding. The company's offer, which is not conditioned on financing, expires at midnight EDT April 22. Odyssey had charged that a <ORGANIZATION> Pepperell-Stevens </ORGANIZATION> merger would violate antitrust laws. But <LOCATION> Pepperell </LOCATION> said it reached agreement with the <ORGANIZATION> FTC </ORGANIZATION> on Friday over divestitures to ease those concerns. The <ORGANIZATION> FTC </ORGANIZATION> would permit <ORGANIZATION> Pepperell </ORGANIZATION>'s previously announced plans to sell half of <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>' bath lines and 20 percent of its sheet lines for about $ 170 million to <ORGANIZATION> NTC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, parent of the textile manufacturer <ORGANIZATION> Bibb </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Pepperell </ORGANIZATION> said. The <ORGANIZATION> FTC </ORGANIZATION> also waived waiting requirements under federal disclosure laws but might require <LOCATION> Pepperell </LOCATION> to sell a sheeting mill, a yarn plant, certain designer licenses and a brand name if the deal was consummated, <LOCATION> Pepperell </LOCATION> stated. The <ORGANIZATION> FTC </ORGANIZATION> has six months to decide whether <LOCATION> Pepperell </LOCATION> must divest those <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> assets. <ORGANIZATION> Prudential-Bache </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Bronston </PERSON> said the sheeting mill generates annual sales of between $ 30 million to $ 40 million, while the yarn plant is relatively small. Among the designer licenses the <ORGANIZATION> FTC </ORGANIZATION> has identified as potential problems are <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Lauren </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Gloria </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Vanderbilt </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Eileen </PERSON> <PERSON> West </PERSON> and <PERSON> Perry </PERSON> <PERSON> Ellis </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bronston </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> Pepperell </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Lanier </PERSON> said that while he would prefer not to sell those assets, `` it would have no significant impact if we had to.'' <PERSON> Bronston </PERSON> said that given its situation, <LOCATION> Pepperell </LOCATION> might be forced to sell the licenses at prices lower than what the company paid for them. <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> also has licenses for the designers <PERSON> Laura </PERSON> <PERSON> Ashley </PERSON>, <PERSON> Pierre </PERSON> <PERSON> Cardin </PERSON> and <PERSON> Givenchy </PERSON>, among others. <LOCATION> Pepperell </LOCATION>'s brands include Arrow, Martex, <PERSON> Lady </PERSON> <PERSON> Pepperell </PERSON> and <PERSON> Burberry </PERSON>. Bidding for <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> began after it received a leveraged buyout offer earlier this year from a group led by its own senior management, including Chairman <PERSON> Whitney </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>, a fifth-generation member of the family that founded the company in 1813. <LOCATION> Pepperell </LOCATION>, which is based in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Point </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ga. </LOCATION>, launched a $ 62.50-a-share tender offer last month after <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> agreed to a buyout by Odyssey at $ 61.50 a share. Odyssey subsequently sweetened its offer to $ 64, and announced last week that it had commitments in place to finance the $ 1.14 billion bid. Under terms of its agreement with Odyssey, <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> board said it would pay the firm up to $ 8 million if the textile company was acquired by a third party for more than $ 64 a share.

<HEAD>Iowa Attorney General Sues Credit Card Giant Over Consumer Laws</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE GLOVER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A lawsuit seeking to force <ORGANIZATION> Citibank </ORGANIZATION> to obey <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> consumer credit laws potentially could affect other companies that, like <ORGANIZATION> Citibank </ORGANIZATION>, offer credit cards in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> but base their card operations elsewhere, the state's attorney general says. Attorney General <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> filed a federal lawsuit Monday seeking to sto <ORGANIZATION> Citibank </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's biggest credit card issuer, from applying the less stringent credit laws of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>, where its credit card operation is based, to other states. The suit contended that although the courts consistently have allowed credit card issuers to use the laws of their home state in setting interest rates wherever they operate, that power should not apply to other consumer credit issues. `` We are challenging the assumption that they can export the laws of states which have few consumer protections into states like <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> that have stronger protections for their citizens,'' <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said at a news conference announcing the suit. `` The suit could affect every bank that has a national credit card operation,'' he said. <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said other states had indicated interest in joining the action. <ORGANIZATION> Citibank </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Sioux </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Falls </LOCATION>, S.D. office referred reporters' calls to its <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> headquarters. Spokesman <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> McQuire </PERSON> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> said that while the company had not seen the suit, it did comply with federal law. <ORGANIZATION> Citibank </ORGANIZATION> is the banking subsidiary of the New York-based <ORGANIZATION> Citicorp </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's largest bank holding company. It is accused of collecting late charges and other fees that are allowed under <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> law but are banned in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>. The company has issued about 15 million credit cards nationwide but insists that <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>'s consumer laws govern its cards wherever they are issued. There are 36,000 <ORGANIZATION> Citibank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> MasterCard </ORGANIZATION> and Visa cards issued in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said although <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> has deregulated credit card interest rates, it also has banned late payment fees and insufficient funds check charges. <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> also requires companies give three months notice before changing the terms of a credit card contract. `` The banks argue that <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> law does n't apply in this situation,'' <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said. `` We say our -LRB- state -RRB- law does protect Iowans.'' <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> also said the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> law gave <ORGANIZATION> Citibank </ORGANIZATION> a competitive advantage over Iowa-based issuers who had to follow their state's stricter credit rules. <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>'s suit seeks a ban on collection of the late payment fees, plus unspecified civil penalties and a refund of any payments which have been collected. The state targeted <ORGANIZATION> Citibank </ORGANIZATION> for the suit because it is the biggest card issuer, although other companies may be sued as well, <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said. The state failed to reach an out-of-court settlement over the issue with <ORGANIZATION> Citibank </ORGANIZATION>, he said. The nation's top 10 credit card companies have about 64 million cards outstanding, representing accounts of more than $ 32 billion.

 A French industrial group is offering $ 75.9 million to acquire <ORGANIZATION> Wolverine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technologies </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a maker of vinyl siding and vinyl windows for the home remodeling industry. The $ 23 a share offer made Monday by <ORGANIZATION> SG </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Acquisition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, a subsidiary of <ORGANIZATION> Compagnie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> de </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Saint-Gobain </ORGANIZATION>, topped an earlier $ 18.50-a-share merger agreement <ORGANIZATION> Wolverine </ORGANIZATION> had with <ORGANIZATION> Ply-Gem </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. Wolverine stock jumped $ 4.87 -LCB- to $ 23.25 a share on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> The <ORGANIZATION> Saint-Gobain </ORGANIZATION> offer, which expires May 6, was conditioned at least 2.1 million of <ORGANIZATION> Wolverine </ORGANIZATION>'s 3.3 million outstanding shares being tendered, said <PERSON> Toney </PERSON> <PERSON> File </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Saint-Gobain </ORGANIZATION> spokesman in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Although <PERSON> Wolverine </PERSON> had agreed to be acquired by Ply-Gem, its board of directors will consider the new offer, said <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Jeffers </PERSON>, <PERSON> Wolverine </PERSON>'s treasurer and vice president for finance. A board meeting has not been scheduled. `` We really need to find out more about it,'' <PERSON> Jeffers </PERSON> said. `` The cash price is certainly a more attractive offer as far as the shareholders are concerned.'' The Ply-Gem agreement prohibited Wolverine from soliciting other offers but not from considering an offer, <PERSON> Jeffers </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Wolverine </ORGANIZATION> reported 1987 earnings of $ 8.4 million on revenue of $ 111 million. <ORGANIZATION> Saint-Gobain </ORGANIZATION> has more than 300 plants and 140,000 employees in 17 countries.

 Secret contract talks between <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> and its pilots union to reach a labor agreement before a possible Machinists' strike have broken off, according to company and union officials. The talks, which were kept secret by `` a gentleman's agreement of confidentiality,'' lasted `` a couple of months,'' said union spokesman <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Cole </PERSON>.

<TEXT>
 A union-commissioned study says <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s planned shutdown of auto production here would cost more than $ 209 million in the first two years for welfare and jobless benefits and lost tax revenue. The two-year social cost analysis by the <ORGANIZATION> Midwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> estimated the cost to local, state and federal governments from the plant shutdown at $ 38,000 for each unemployed <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> worker. <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> announced in January it plans to end auto production at <LOCATION> Kenosha </LOCATION> by Sept. 30, laying off 5,500 workers. <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> took over the plant last year as part of its purchase of <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> `` Of about the two dozen studies that we've done, that's the highest figure we've ever come up with,'' <PERSON> Greg </PERSON> <PERSON> LeRoy </PERSON>, MCLR research director, told reporters at the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Auto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Local </ORGANIZATION> 72 headquarters Monday. <PERSON> LeRoy </PERSON> said the study, commissioned by Local 72, was based on a previous <ORGANIZATION> MCLR </ORGANIZATION> study in 1985 but used more comprehensive welfare and employment figures from the state, <LOCATION> Kenosha </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Racine </LOCATION> counties and the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Statistics </ORGANIZATION>. It estimated that the plant's closing would result in $ 62.4 million in unemployment compensation, $ 54.5 million in lost federal income tax revenue, $ 26 million in lost Social Security tax revenue, $ 21.4 million in welfare expenditures and $ 17 million in lost state sales and excise tax revenue. <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Tommy </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> has threatened to sue <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION>, claiming the automaker broke a promise to keep the plant open for five years. <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> officials have said they may have been overly optimistic when negotiating with the state for improvements and job training funds, but have repeatedly denied making any such promise.

<HEAD>Nissan Will Curb Car Exports To the United States</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Nissan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s No. 2 automaker, will reduce car exports to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to ease pressure from mounting inventories, <ORGANIZATION> Nissan </ORGANIZATION> officials said Tuesday. They would n't specify the scale of the planned reduction. But Japanese press reports, which <ORGANIZATION> Nissan </ORGANIZATION> officials called speculative, said the company will cut shipments of passenger cars by about 30 percent to 200,000 in the April-September period from 283,000 a year earlier. <ORGANIZATION> Nissan </ORGANIZATION> dealers in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> are flooded with unsold cars, an auto-industry analyst in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> said. According to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> industry estimates, <ORGANIZATION> Nissan </ORGANIZATION> had about 155 days' worth of inventories in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> at the beginning of March, well above the 70-day average for Japanese carmakers as a whole <ORGANIZATION> Nissan </ORGANIZATION> attributes its sales slump in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to complete model changes planned later this year for some of its popular cars, such as 200SX coupes and Maxima sedans. Consumers tend to refrain from buying cars that are slated for restyling and other major changes, <ORGANIZATION> Nissan </ORGANIZATION> officials explained. Industry watchers said <ORGANIZATION> Nissan </ORGANIZATION>'s newly styled models in the domestic market are proving popular among consumers. However, because of the scale of the company, which sells about 2.7 million units of motor vehicles worldwide annually, it takes about four years to carry out a full, company-wide model changeover. <ORGANIZATION> Nissan </ORGANIZATION> began restraining U.S.-bound car shipments late last year as a result of a sales slowdown following price hikes forced under the yen's prolonged strength. Mainly because of <ORGANIZATION> Nissan </ORGANIZATION>'s slower exports, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s car shipments to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in the year ended March 31 fell short of the 2.3 million-unit limit for the first time since the restraints were imposed by the Japanese government in 1980. According to unofficial industry figures, Japanese car exports to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> fell about 86,000 units short of the limit last year. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> decided it would continue the ceiling at 2.3 million units a year for the new year beginning April 1.

<HEAD>Tighter Banking Scrutiny After Marcos, Duvalier Cases</HEAD>

 Swiss banks and big financial institutions will come under closer supervision in accepting funds from foreign leaders, the <ORGANIZATION> Swiss </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday. The cases of deposed presidents <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Jean-Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Duvalier </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION> sparked the need for stronger surveillance, the regulatory agency said in its annual report. <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> officials claim <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> stashed up to about $ 5 billion in <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION> during his 20-year rule. <PERSON> Duvalier </PERSON> is alleged to have diverted several hundred million dollars into Swiss accounts. Both were ousted from office in 1986. The commission's probe of the case failed to find any wrongdoing by the banks involved, which were not named. But the agency said it will now require top management of <LOCATION> Swiss </LOCATION> banks, rather than lower-ranking employees, to judge whether to take up or continue `` such exposed business ties.'' The panel also called for tougher Swiss laws against money laundering, terming existing measures insufficient to combat the practice. Lawmakers should consider criminal penalties for legal entities caught laundering money, it said. On other topics, it said that in the wake of last October's stock market crash, banks will have to report more openly on how they cover losses in securities trading, and on notes issues

 <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Fronterhouse </PERSON>, chairman of financially troubled <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> RepublicBank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, is expected to submit his resignation today, according to published reports.

<HEAD>Japan Notes Shift in Economy as Fiscal-Year Surplus Falls</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KOZO MIZOGUCHI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A change in the structure of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s economy contributed to the first decline in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s fiscal-year trade surplus in eight years, government and private analysts said Tuesday. The <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> announced Monday that <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s overall trade surplus dropped 15.3 percent in the fiscal year ended March 31 to $ 76 billion from $ 89.7 billion in the previous fiscal year. It was the first decline since 1979, when <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s oil import bill soared because of the second oil crisis. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s trade surplus with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> posted its first annual decline since 1982, dropping 2.2 percent to $ 50.9 billion from a record $ 52 billion the year before. `` A shift toward the direction of a decline in trade surplus is taking place at a steady pace,'' said <PERSON> Nobuo </PERSON> <PERSON> Murakami </PERSON>, deputy director of the <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>'s Export Division. The yen's rapid appreciation against the dollar the past two years and the government policy to promote domestic demand were major factors in the decline in the surplus, <PERSON> Murakami </PERSON> said. The yen has roughly doubled in value against the dollar since its most recent low in February 1985. In September 1985, monetary authorities from seven major industrialized countries agreed to drive down the dollar's value to help reduce the huge <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade deficit. A higher yen makes Japanese exports more expensive abroad and less competitive, while imported products are cheaper in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> sent 35.8 percent of its exports to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in fiscal year 1987, down from 38 percent the previous year. Its exports to the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> increased to 16.7 percent from 15.4 percent, and to Southeast Asian countries to 23.7 percent from 20.6 percent. `` It is clear that some major Japanese products, including automobiles, are losing their competiveness on the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> market, though personal computers and other office equipment remain in high demand,'' said <PERSON> Taku </PERSON> <PERSON> Hiramatsu </PERSON>, assistant manager of the <ORGANIZATION> research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Hiramatsu </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s auto exports to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, which accounted for about 30 percent of the nation's total exports to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, `` will be getting further squeezed in the future'' because several Japanese automakers will be making car in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in 1990s. Japanese automakers have fallen short of the government-set export quota of 2.3 million passenger cars during the year, the first such shortfall since <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> began limting its auto exports to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> market in 1981, local news reports said Tuesday. An official of the <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Automobile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> said the figures for <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s car exports to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would be announced late this month, and the volume would be `` far below'' the 2.3 million vehicles sent to <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> the previous year. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, blamed the shortfall on the higher yen and the `` slower-than-expected increase in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> car market.'' Japanese car makers have raised their export prices to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> by more than 20 percent on the average over the past two years to make up for losses stemming from the dollar's depreciation `` More significant results in the reduction of -LRB- <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s -RRB- trade surplus with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will surely come in years to come,'' <PERSON> Murakami </PERSON> said. `` It's just two years since the yen's appreciation began.''

<TEXT>
 Six months after the stock market crash of 1987, a sense of shock and confusion still pervades Wall Street. As the days, weeks and months have passed since Black Monday on Oct. 19, many industry leaders, market analysts and investors have been relieved to see the damage, extensive as it was, apparently contained. Stock prices have since recovered some of their losses. Several reforms are being made in the mechanism of the marketplace itself. And, perhaps most important of all, the economy has endured the experience with hardly any sign of significant damage. But the crash still weighs heavily on just about any financial decision or economic forecast these days. By all accounts, it has severely dampened the enthusiasm of both professional money managers and the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> public for stock investments. Trading volume in all the major stock markets so far in 1988 is running behind the pace it set a year ago. Through April 8, volume was down 4.1 percent at the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, and 16.7 percent in the over-the-counter market. The <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION> decline would be much bigger were it not for heavy trading in stocks of companies targeted for takeovers and high-yielding issues with impending dividend payments. Veteran observers caution that it will take still more time to assess the crash's ultimate effects. Even with the advantage of hindsight, it is clear that the crash was many different things to many different people. At one extreme, some analysts will tell you Black Monday was just the first stage of a severe bear market that will usher in a recession _ or worse _ in the nation's economy. At the other, some insist it was nothing more than an exaggerated `` correction'' that drove excessive enthusiasm out of the marketplace, setting the stage for new rallies in stock prices and helping to prevent a recession that might otherwise be in progress today. While there is n't yet, and may never be, a widely accepted consensus on what precisely caused the crash, a good many analysts have come to agree that it stemmed in large measure from a change in the credit policies of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> and central banks of other prominent industrialized countries. In this view, these powerful institutions created a financial boom in the mid-1980s by fostering the growth of a vast pool of `` liquidity,'' or money looking for a place to go to work. Starting in early 1987, they began to shut off the flow, prompted by fears of inflation and a long decline in the value of the dollar against leading foreign currencies. Economist <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Wojnilower </PERSON>, a managing director at the Wall Street firm of <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, said in a recent appraisal: `` As 1987 wore on, it became more and more evident _ so that ultimately even the stock markets had to accept the fact _ that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> monetary policy was on a course leading to an eventual recession.'' That recession did n't arrive on schedule, <PERSON> Wojnilower </PERSON> added, because restrictive monetary policies were immediately abandoned in the aftermath of the crash. He says a business slump is still in the offing, probably in 1989, `` but it need not be severe. The end of the world is not at hand.'' With all the studies, investigations and reports by blue-ribbon panels that have been done since the crash, major steps to reform and fortify the markets have come slowly or not at all. The presidential commission headed by <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Dillon </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Read </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> promoted the idea that the nation's financial markets _ the stock market and the futures market where contracts on stock indexes are traded _ could be set up and managed as `` one market.'' The <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> plan called for coordinating the regulation of the markets and installing `` circuit breakers'' that would prevent a crisis from erupting in one market and spreading to the other. Those who blame computer-driven program trading for contributing to the October debacle point out that such techniques are triggered by discrepancies in the prices of stock index futures and the underlying equities. But the two markets have long operated under significantly different rules and have resisted regulatory changes that might threaten their franchises. <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>'s super-regulatory proposal has been bogged down by haggling over who would be the super regulator. Although the <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> panel favored the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION>, the central bank appears reluctant to take on the job. The <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> is more willing to fill the void, but regulators of the futures markets have resisted the idea of turning over a measure of their authority to the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION>. To help sort out the competing interests, the White House has appointed yet another committee, comprised of representatives of the various regulatory agencies, which is expected to report still more recommendations later this spring. The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> has adopted one notable new rule _ a constraint known as a `` collar'' that bars use of its main order-processing system for one method of program trading should the Dow Jones industrial average rise or fall on any given day by as much as 50 points. In addition, the <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION> has announced a sharp increase in the amount of capital that must be held by its specialists, the brokers who act as meeting points for buy and sell orders on the trading floor. Separately, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dealers </ORGANIZATION> has moved to try to strengthen the over-the-counter market for unlisted stocks, which it oversees. By summer, <ORGANIZATION> NASD </ORGANIZATION> procedures are scheduled to be in effect to decrease the market's dependency on voice communication by telephone, and to punish dealers who back away from fast-moving markets without a special-case excuse. The aim of such measures is to increase the markets' strength and accessibility in times of stress, so that the machinery does n't break down altogether and turn an already bad situation into a disaster Still, many regulators and securities industry officials say it would be pointless and quite possibly dangerous to attempt to legislate away the threat of any future crashes. If the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> were standing by with its enormous resources as a buyer of last resort in times of crisis, presumably the stock market would be less susceptible, if not immune, to panics. But something like that would also cost the market what <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Hardiman </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> NASD </ORGANIZATION>, calls `` the discipline of risk.'' If investors believed they could rely indefinitely on an institution like the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> to support the market, they might well go on a speculative binge that would create stresses not even the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> could deal with. Under this line of reasoning, the quickest way to set the stage for the next market crash would be to create a system to assure everybody that it could never happen again.

 The strength of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economy since the Oct. 19 stock market crash has demolished the belief that history invariably repeats itself. Generations of schoolchildren learned that the stock market crashed in October 1929 and the nation then slid into a depression from which it did not fully recover until World War II. Last year's crash was even bigger than 1929's. Half a trillion dollars of stock wealth was wiped out in a single day as the Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks fell 508 points, a record 22.6 percent. Yet six months later, the unemployment rate is at a nine-year low and industries such as steel, paper and chemicals are straining to keep up with booming demand. In fact, many economists now believe the crash helped keep the economic expansion alive by throwing cold water on inflation fears and bringing about lower interest rates. Suddenly the idea of a crashing stock market does n't seem so frightening _ especially to the 80 percent of households that do n't own stock Of course, fearful chart watchers point out that even though the Dow average is rebounding now, it also rebounded after the 1929 crash. They note that while President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> is optimistic in April 1988, President <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoover </PERSON> was optimistic in April 1930. By extension, the pessimists conclude that history may yet repeat itself. Poverty, they say, may be just around the corner. The attempt to draw parallels falls short, however. `` People who argue that history will repeat itself simply do n't understand history,'' said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Day </PERSON>, an economist at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> History shows that stock indexes may repeat previous patterns for a few months but inevitably go off in different directions, Day said. The economy of 1988 is far healthier and more resistant to shocks than the economy of 1930 was. For example: _ The rise of service jobs means Americans are more insulated from the ups and downs of farming and manufacturing, two sectors that led the way into the Great Depression _ Unemployment insurance, Social Security and other programs protect Americans, and the economy as a whole, from sudden drops in income _ The 1929 crash came against the backdrop of recession Industrial production had fallen at an annual rate of 20 percent since August of that year. Prices and incomes fell, too. This time production, prices and incomes have all been rising. _ World trade spiraled downward in the late 1920s and early 1930s because of slumping economies and protectionism This time world trade is expanding and the crash helped dissuade <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> from enacting a replay of the infamous Smoot-Hawley tariff act of 1930. _ Finally, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Deal </LOCATION> regulatory reforms instituted in the 1930s, such as federal deposit insurance, helped keep Wall Street's fear from infecting the banking system this time The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION>, which bungled its job after the 1929 crash, acted quickly to quell panic. `` Money is not disappearing into mattresses,'' said <PERSON> Brent </PERSON> <PERSON> Erensel </PERSON>, senior banking analyst at <ORGANIZATION> Donaldson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lufkin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Jenrette </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. Consumer confidence rebounded to pre-crash levels within months Economists worried last fall that Wall Street was a canary in a coal mine, sending an early warning of disaster. Now many believe the signal was false. `` These sudden drops, caused by this kind of ... stampede behavior _ you just kind of ignore that. It does n't give you much information,'' said <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Brock </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wisconsin </ORGANIZATION> economist. To be sure, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economy is not glowingly healthy. Last year, 184 banks failed, the most since the Depression. But the closings were orderly, not triggered by bank runs. In the 1930s, panics forced thousands of banks to close annually. Depositors assume, correctly, that regulators will not allow major banks to fail, said <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahoney </PERSON>, an associate director at <ORGANIZATION> Moody </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. There are other problems: the trade deficit, the budget deficit, the Third World debt bomb. Unemployment and poverty persist in an underclass of disadvantaged minorities. But the problems, while worrisome, do n't point to a 1930s-style depression, most economists say. `` Right after the Monday massacre people said, ` Oh my God, here we go again,''' but now no one is quite certain why the crash occurred or what it means, <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Brock </PERSON> said. `` As one jokester said, ` If we could have another one of these, maybe we could settle this debate.'''

 The Japanese stock market's unrelenting climb to new heights since Black Monday has made the land of the rising sun and its booming economy the envy of every market struggling to regain lost momentum. Unlike the crash, when markets from <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION> plummeted in reaction to Wall Street's collapse, the recovery of world markets since Oct. 19 has been relatively uneven. Markets have followed the pace of their own economies, and investors who once roamed the globe in search of equities have returned to the backyard markets they know best. `` I do n't think I could describe any spillover effects,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Brusca </PERSON>, chief economist at <ORGANIZATION> Nikko </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` It's more the case that stock markets seem to be tracking economic growth internally. So far this year, major stock markets outside the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> are up about 13.5 percent, according to an index compiled by <ORGANIZATION> Morgan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stanley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, while the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> market is up about 4.5 percent. European markets have turned in a mixed performance since the crash. The <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION> exchange is up on takeover activity; <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s market is sluggish; and a slow-growing <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> economy is taking its toll on the Bourse. But if those markets show glimmers of life, the advance has been blinding in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, home of the world's biggest equities market. While the <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jones </ORGANIZATION> industrial average has sputtered to and fro beneath pre-crash levels, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s key market barometer has reached stunning all-time highs with ease. The key <ORGANIZATION> Nikkei </ORGANIZATION> 100-share index breezed its way into record territory in early April. `` The story this year really is mostly a story about <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Sladkus </PERSON>, a vice president at <ORGANIZATION> Morgan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stanley </ORGANIZATION>. But, he noted, the market's momentum is n't due to its magnetic attraction for investors outside the island nation. `` It's totally due to domestic considerations,'' <PERSON> Sladkus </PERSON> said. Spurred by a roaring financial boom, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s stock market is reaping the benefits of a surge in corporate profits, a sharp increase in consumption and tax reforms that are likely to prompt consumers to move their money out of savings accounts and into equities. While the quick about-face is n't causing Japanese investors to lose any sleep, some on the other side of the ocean watch with furrowed brows. `` There's concern that with the market going up so strongly and with the economy growing that maybe the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> is not going to be as accommodative,'' <PERSON> Brusca </PERSON> said, noting that some fear <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s central bank `` could take away one important underpinning of the market _ the liquidity that helped spur the growth'' in the first place. `` Nobody is quite comfortable that a country the size of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and with half the population of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has the biggest stock market, even though -LRB- the Japanese -RRB- seem to do everything right,'' said <PERSON> Byron </PERSON> <PERSON> Wien </PERSON>, managing director and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> investment strategist at <ORGANIZATION> Morgan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stanley </ORGANIZATION>. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times-Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> 100-share index remains about 25 percent below its level just prior to the crash. Despite the fact that the market has been extremely volatile, analysts are n't too concerned about the speed of its recovery. `` The equity market was overvalued before the crash,'' said <PERSON> Randal </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldsmith </PERSON>, a market strategist with the <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> investment firm <ORGANIZATION> James </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Capel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> `` There's no reason to go right back up to that level yet.'' The market has been supported by an increase in the number of companies buying back their own shares, heightened takeover activity, better-than-expected corporate profits and relief that the economy was n't hit harder by the crash. Thanks to the takeover battle for <ORGANIZATION> Societe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Generale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> de </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Belgique </ORGANIZATION>, the largest Belgian corporation, the <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION> Bourse has put in the best performance among the European exchanges. In <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, where the stock exchange shut down for four days following Black Monday, trading volume stalled and investor confidence had to be rebuilt from the ground up. But the market is enjoying some spillover enthusiasm from <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, since `` the Asian investment community is linked together,'' <PERSON> Brusca </PERSON> noted. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, on the other hand, is a `` dog, if you will; it's a real barker,'' <PERSON> Brusca </PERSON> said. `` They've been experiencing sluggish growth, their monetary policy remains restrictive, and their currency is appreciating, which makes it difficult for German firms to sell their products overseas for a profit,'' he said. Trading volume throughout the world has been relatively light, which analysts say is a sign of confusion among investors. To alleviate fears of the unknown, international investors went home. `` People were operating in markets overseas that they did n't understand that well, and so they brought their money home These markets may not be doing so well, but at least investors understand them,'' <PERSON> Brusca </PERSON> said.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> is investigating safety complaints from airlines about <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 747 and 767 widebody jets and has issued a safety inspection directive for one of the aerospace company's jetliner models. <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> officials revealed Monday that an `` airworthiness directive'' on the 747-200 was issued Friday because of reports that fuel leaking into cargo compartments. <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commercial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airplanes </ORGANIZATION> officials refused Monday to respond to the airline complaints or comment on the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> action, but said they would hold a news conference later. However, <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Condit </PERSON>, executive vice president of <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commercial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airplanes </ORGANIZATION>, was quoted in today's editions of The Wall Street Journal as saying letters from the airlines represent `` communications that go on between us and airlines all the time. That's how we make our products better.'' Airline, <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> officials have noted that none of the defects cited to date has been linked to a crash or other major damage, but the directive warned, `` Fuel in this -LRB- cargo -RRB- compartment could result in a fire and substantial damage.'' The directive said the leaks were caused by loose or broken bolts that attach fuel tanks to the wings and called for repairs `` before further flight.'' <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> officials said the order applied to 317 operating 747-200s. <PERSON> Nick </PERSON> <PERSON> Wantiez </PERSON> of the local <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> office said Monday the investigation also would cover airline complaints ranging from wrong parts to incorrectly installed firefighting systems. `` We are putting together a plan this week to deal with these complaints and to determine what actions must be taken to assure compliance with federal regulations,'' <PERSON> Wantiez </PERSON> said. He said the inspection order followed reports of incidents by <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lines </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Lufthansa </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> India </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Aerolineas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Argentinas </ORGANIZATION> and a leasing company, starting Nov. 21 with a <ORGANIZATION> JAL </ORGANIZATION> report in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> of a fuel leak involving a bold that had broken from corrosion. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Jimenez </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> confirmed Monday that letters citing problems in 767s and 747s had been received from <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lines </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> All </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nippon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>. Problems cited by <ORGANIZATION> All </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nippon </ORGANIZATION> included a wing flap disintegrating in flight on the first day of service, smoke from a misassembled power unit that caused an emergency landing, and problems in a fire extinguisher system. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, <LOCATION> American </LOCATION>'s senior vice president for operations, said his company's maintenance crews found three 767-200s with faulty pipelines that carry firefighting chemicals to the forward and rear cargo compartments. `` The pipes were misrouted,'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said. `` If you light them off for the forward belly system they go off in the rear.'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said that after being informed by American, <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> found one faulty system on its production line and All Nippon and JAL found several in their planes.

 For <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Locke </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> E.F. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>'s post-crash demise derailed a 13-year career at the once-proud investment giant, leaving him jobless <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> scrambled to start his own company after <PERSON> Hutton </PERSON>'s new parent <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> fired him <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Clevenger </PERSON> was among the luckier ones: <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> invited him to stay. <PERSON> Hutton </PERSON> was the biggest Wall Street casualty in the aftermath of the Oct. 19 collapse in stock prices. Already reeling from management struggles, excessive expenses, declining profits and the legacy of an embarassing check-kiting scandal, the crash sent the company into a desperate search for a buyer. The new <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> describes itself as one of the strongest and biggest brokerages. But the marriage has left at least 6,000 people out of work. `` I was concerned long before the crash that the end was near,'' <PERSON> Locke </PERSON> said in an interview. `` Nothing lasts forever. We'd had a bull market for five years. The compensation had gotten out of hand.'' <PERSON> Locke </PERSON>, former senior executive vice president and managing director of <PERSON> Hutton </PERSON>'s public finance unit, had at one time been in charge of more than 80 investment bankers and earned a $ 700,000 salary. When <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> acquired <PERSON> Hutton </PERSON> in December, <PERSON> Locke </PERSON> said he was at first invited to say, but quickly discovered there was no place for him in the merged operation. `` I felt redundant. We parted friends,'' he said. Now the 50-year-old veteran spends his time visiting potential job contacts and using a borrowed office and telephone to arrange interviews. He is considering moving to the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> and might start his own consulting firm. `` I do n't know what October 19th was, a signal or an accident,'' he said. `` But I think Wall Street faces much more consolidation.'' <PERSON> Locke </PERSON> said his only <PERSON> Hutton </PERSON> memento is an antique he and his wife bought, a carved-out pig from a butcher's shop with the inscription, `` <PERSON> Hutton </PERSON>'s For Pork.'' But <PERSON> Locke </PERSON> said he harbored no bitterness toward <PERSON> Hutton </PERSON>. `` I've been in this business too long to get angry,'' he said For <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON>, who had worked at <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION>'s parent <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> before he quit and went to <PERSON> Hutton </PERSON> four years ago as vice president in charge of its in-house financial video unit, there was a bitter irony in the acquisition. `` In a roundabout way I was hoist by my own petard,'' said <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON>, 41. `` Dad came back and sucked us up.'' <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> said he earned nearly $ 100,000 at <LOCATION> Hutton </LOCATION> producing an internal monthly news show, sales promotions and advertising. Like everybody else at <PERSON> Hutton </PERSON>, he was well aware of the company's problems but was n't prepared for the sudden finale `` The big shock was the speed with which it took place,'' he said of the merger announcement. `` Twelve days later we were fired.'' With a half-dozen other people in his department, <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> negotiated to acquire <PERSON> Hutton </PERSON>'s video production facilities, housed in a second-floor office building in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>'s wholesale merchandise district north of Wall Street. <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> started <ORGANIZATION> Metro </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Production </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, which has since received video production assignments from several financial service companies. Dressed in casual clothes behind a simple black desk in his office, <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> was philosophical about the sudden change and said he expected to do `` as well, if not better.'' Nevertheless, he said, `` Let's face it. When I saw the movie ` Broadcast News,' I loved the line where the fired executive told the boss, ` I hope you die real soon.''' For <PERSON> Clevenger </PERSON>, who started with <PERSON> Hutton </PERSON> in 1969, the <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> acquisition injected stability and relief. As a first vice president in <PERSON> Hutton </PERSON>'s consulting services unit in <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Clevenger </PERSON> had long been worried because of client concerns about <PERSON> Hutton </PERSON>'s health. `` I was pleased that the merger happened,'' said the 42-year-old father of two. He would n't disclose his salary, but as one of the senior people in <PERSON> Hutton </PERSON>'s nationwide network, he was among the highest paid. Although his post-crash business is down 20 percent, <PERSON> Clevenger </PERSON> said, `` I'm guessing that when the year's over, I'll be in approximately the same position with the combined firm.'' Nevertheless, he said, he had some regrets about <PERSON> Hutton </PERSON>'s collapse `` I'm remorseful because of what it did to a group of people that I relate to, particularly the 600 or 700 people who are part of our division. Some of the closeness has gone because some of these people have left,'' he said.

 When recruiters for accounting giant <ORGANIZATION> Touche </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ross </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> visited graduate business schools earlier this year, students scrambled to get interviews. At the same time, the venerable investment banking firm <ORGANIZATION> Goldman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sachs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> had trouble finding good candidates. The contrast illustrates what students, school officials and campus recruiters agree is a disillusionment with Wall Street careers in the aftermath of the October stock market crash and a corresponding surge of interest in high-paying consulting and accounting professions. `` We found here that the presentations investment banks made were not attended well at all,'' said <PERSON> Joyce </PERSON> <PERSON> Watts </PERSON>, director of career counseling and placement at <ORGANIZATION> Northwestern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>'s J.L. <ORGANIZATION> Kellogg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Graduate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION>. `` That's very different than in the last five years, when you could hardly get in the door of a presentation.'' Graduate business students participating in a recent conference at Northwestern said that consulting positions, which offer starting salaries ranging from $ 50,000 to $ 100,000, are a lot more attractive than investment banking careers now because of the employment uncertainty raised by the crash. `` A good part of my class had pegged hopes on Wall Street,'' said <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Sheridan </PERSON>, a 28-year-old <ORGANIZATION> Cornell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> business student at the conference. `` You see a lot of chameleons out there. Suddenly they're all into consulting.'' Several schools have projected sharp reductions in the number of students who will go into investment banking this year. At <PERSON> Kellogg </PERSON>, for example, only about 12 percent will accept Wall Street offers, down from 17 percent last year. <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> expects about 15 percent, down from 28 percent, and <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Wharton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> expects about 15 percent, down from 25 percent. Wall Street firms themselves have been curtailing campus recruitment drives this year, partly because they are undergoing their own post-crash retrenchment. But many have found the pool of MBA talent has shrunk. `` This year we've had more people turn down jobs than in the past five years,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorter </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Goldman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sachs </ORGANIZATION> partner who spoke at the Northwestern conference. <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON>, manager of professional recruiting at <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Capital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Markets </ORGANIZATION>, said although his firm hunted for fewer MBAs this year, `` student interest was down on campus, I have to be very direct with you about that.''

 <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, the epicenter of last October's stock market quake, remains jumpy at any aftershocks and watches warily for warning signs of future trouble `` So far, so good,'' is the opinion of <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ehrenhalt </PERSON>, the regional commissioner of the federal <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Statistics </ORGANIZATION>. `` The economy has held up better than most expected, but we still have n't got the situation fully in focus.'' Among the fuzzy images, six months later: _ The city, whose financial worries faded during the bull market, has scaled back its plans for growth The goal of a 30,000-member police department is on hold, two firehouses are closed, and museums and libraries found their budgets cut. _ The real estate market, though still inflated by standards of most <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> cities, has lost some steam, with office vacancy rates up, several construction projects on hold and condos no longer guaranteed to skyrocket in value _ Unemployment figures remain stable overall, but layoffs in the financial sector may show up in the statistics later as severance pay runs out for some and as businesses that depend on Wall Street are forced to follow suit The city adopted a cautious stance almost immediately after the crash. Within 10 days, Mayor <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> had ordered a 90-day hiring freeze. `` We needed the three months to evaluate what the crash meant,'' said <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Shorris </PERSON>, deputy director of the city Office of Management and Budget. The city recalculated its projections for fiscal 1989 _ July 1 to June 30, 1989 _ and figured its tax revenues would be about $ 270 million less than expected. `` A lot of people were doomsayers, taking terrible, grim positions'' after the crash, <PERSON> Shorris </PERSON> said. `` In context, $ 270 million out of a tax base of $ 14 billion is hardly a major change. But there was a reduction of growth.'' The slowdown in the local economy will force the city to keep a tight rein on spending. Plans to expand the <ORGANIZATION> Sanitation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> were cut by 260 positions. The Department of Cultural Affairs saw its fiscal 1989 budget cut by $ 5.6 million; libraries will get $ 7.7 million less than originally expected, which will probably result in shorter hours and other cuts in services. Yet <PERSON> Shorris </PERSON> said the true effect of the crash shows up not so much in the data about the city that pours into his office, but in conversations and attitudes across the nation. `` More than the crash itself, it was reevaluation of nation's economy that was the most important byproduct,'' <PERSON> Shorris </PERSON> said `` That has a very important effect on us. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> has been more affected than almost any other city or state because of the high concentration of security and finance activity.'' One obvious casualty of the crash was a two-tower office complex planned for the southwest corner of Central Park, with the investment firm <ORGANIZATION> Salomon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION> as the prime tenant. Though the firm gave a variety of reasons for pulling out of the project, the crash and subsequent cutbacks contributed. That also hurt the city, which was counting on selling the property for $ 455 million, including $ 40 million in subway improvements. `` There's really been a reassessment of new construction. Several projects have been put on hold as a result of Black Monday,'' said <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Lynford </PERSON>, a real estate market analyst and publisher of an industry newsletter. The office vacancy rate was at 9 -LCB- percent in October and may be in the 14 percent range by the end of this year, <PERSON> Lynford </PERSON> said, noting that one percentage point represents 3.5 million square feet _ or more than half of one of the World Trade Center towers. In the residential market, he said, `` Unless you're talking about the premier residential units in the city, there has been and will be a comparatively more sluggish market than it has been the last couple of years, with slower rates of appreciation.'' Much of the shifting in the real estate market, both office and residential, can be traced to job cuts in the financial services industry, he said. From 1982 to 1987, 25 percent of the city's job growth was in financial services. `` <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> is making a new transition into an economic environment characterized by uncertainty, risk and vulnerability in its dependence for growth on Wall Street and the financial industry,'' said <PERSON> Ehrenhalt </PERSON>. `` We're not out of the woods yet.''

 The stock market was mixed in light trading today as the market its digested recent gains and investors waited for fresh economic data to be released later in the week. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was up 2.32 at 2,098.31 by mid-afternoon. Losers slightly outnumbered gainers by about 10 to 9 in the overall tally of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 722 down, 681 up and 519 unchanged. Volume on the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> came to 95.48 million shares at 2 p.m. on Wall Street. `` The volume is very light, and what it shows is that there's no enthusiasm,'' said <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Daino </PERSON>, a technical analyst at <ORGANIZATION> Smith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Barney </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Harris </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Upham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. Analysts were not surprised that the market was little changed, noting that the impressive 102.13-point rise the <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION> posted last week had to be digested While the market appeared to be staying put throughout the session, most analysts agreed there are positive underpinnings for equities. `` -LRB- The market -RRB- went up a long way, and we expect it to retrench,'' said <PERSON> Hidegarde </PERSON> <PERSON> Zagorski </PERSON>, vice president of <ORGANIZATION> Prudential-Bache </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, but `` once the selling is over, it will move into higher ground.'' Meanwhile, many investors remain on the sidelines as they await the release of new economic data. While they are certain to focus on February's merchandise trade report due out on Thursday, the release of retail sales figures and a meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Seven </ORGANIZATION> major industrial countries, both scheduled for Wednesday, are likely to attract attention. `` A lot of people are going to play it close to the vest until they see some direction from the numbers coming out,'' said <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Vandenberg </PERSON>, a vice president at <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. Analysts also noted that investors are once again confronting what has become a psychological barrier at the 2,100-level on the Dow Indeed, the key market barometer touched 2,101 shortly after noon but then eased back. `` The Dow has bumped its head against that level so many times, so there is some hesitation'' when it approaches the mark, <PERSON> Zagorski </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Honda </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> was the shining star in an otherwise dull auto sector, rising 3 to 146 -LCB-.

<HEAD>Officials Agree on Restructuring Plan to Make Company More

<TEXT>
 Government participants in <ORGANIZATION> Airbus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industrie </ORGANIZATION> approved guidelines Tuesday to overhaul management of the European aircraft consortium and make it more accountable financially. The approval came against a background of intense competition between <ORGANIZATION> Airbus </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aircraft makers, who complain that the company sells planes more cheaply because of unfair government aid. <ORGANIZATION> Airbus </ORGANIZATION> denies the accusations but has been under increased internal pressure to become more efficient. British Trade and Industry Minister <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Clarke </PERSON>, Spanish Industry Minister <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Croissier </PERSON>, German Economy Ministry State Secretary <PERSON> Erich </PERSON> <PERSON> Riedl </PERSON> and French Transport Minister <PERSON> Jacques </PERSON> <PERSON> Douffiagues </PERSON> approved the guidelines, contained in a report presented by four consultants, one from each country, calling for fundamental management changes. <PERSON> Clarke </PERSON> told a news conference the ministers reached what he called surprisingly speedy agreement on the need for a management restructuring aimed at cutting costs, clarifying costs and expenses, accelerating decision-making and running the operation `` on clear commercial lines.'' The report asserts that despite an increase in production and sales, <ORGANIZATION> Airbus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industrie </ORGANIZATION> had failed to reduce costs and increase efficiency. Based in <LOCATION> Toulouse </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Airbus </ORGANIZATION> was created in 1970 by the French firm <ORGANIZATION> Aerospatiale </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aerospace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Messerschmitt-Boelkow-Blohm </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> GmbH </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Construcciones </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronauticas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> S.A. </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> CASA </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- of <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>, with the aid of the governments of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Aerospatiale </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> MBB </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> GmbH </ORGANIZATION> each own 37.9 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Airbus </ORGANIZATION>, while <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aerospace </ORGANIZATION> owns 20 percent and CASA 4.2 percent. Combined assets of the consortium exceed $ 12 billion. <PERSON> Riedl </PERSON> called the general agreement Tueday among the officials `` a giant step forward.'' `` <ORGANIZATION> Airbus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industrie </ORGANIZATION>'s pioneer stage is now something we've definitely left behind Airbus has come of age,'' he said. The officials called for <ORGANIZATION> Airbus </ORGANIZATION> and its industrial partners to present detailed plans of action to implement the recommendations at a meeting May 5 in <LOCATION> Hannover </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Croissier </PERSON> said the officials did not discuss <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials' accusations of unfair government subsidies to <ORGANIZATION> Airbus </ORGANIZATION> in the Tuesday meeting, but said recent talks between <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> officials and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade officials had led to a better climate <PERSON> Clarke </PERSON> said the four governments aimed to revamp <ORGANIZATION> Airbus </ORGANIZATION>' management structure `` so that government support is reduced. <ORGANIZATION> Airbus </ORGANIZATION> has received orders for more than 1,000 aircraft, including from five of the top 10 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> airlines, and carved out an estimated 20 percent share of the world jetliner business, competing against <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> builders <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> McDonnell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which dominate the industry. The treasuries of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> financed development of two new Airbus models, but now the governments believe it is time the consortium begins to function like a public company. <PERSON> Clarke </PERSON> said the importance of the accord to overhaul <ORGANIZATION> Airbus </ORGANIZATION> management structure is that `` Airbus will have to become a project economically feasible on its own.'' Croissier called <ORGANIZATION> Airbus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industrie </ORGANIZATION> `` by far the most succesful European industrial cooperation project.'' The so-called `` Four Wise Men's report'' the officials approved Tuesday called for turning the <ORGANIZATION> Airbus </ORGANIZATION> consortium into a public limited company by 1992; revamping the supervisory board to increase policy control; and creating a financial director post to account for program costs, profits and losses.

 <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> has proposed a slate of five executives headed by Chairman <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Campeau </PERSON> to become directors of <ORGANIZATION> Federated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> once <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> takes over <PERSON> Federated </PERSON>. <PERSON> Federated </PERSON>, under its merger agreement with the Canadian company, agreed to obtain the resignation of all but three of its current 17 directors once <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION>'s tender offer for all of <PERSON> Federated </PERSON>'s stock is completed. <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION>'s offer to pay all <PERSON> Federated </PERSON> stockholders $ 73.50 a share is to expire at 5 p.m. April 20, but may be extended to May 12. The director changes would give <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> control of five of the eight seats remaining on the revamped <PERSON> Federated </PERSON> board. <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> said its slate of directors would act to complete the merger with <PERSON> Federated </PERSON> as soon as possible following completion of the tender offer. Besides <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION>, 63, founder of the Toronto-based development company, the other <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> nominees are: <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Roddy </PERSON>, 45, <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s president and chief operating officer; <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Tysoe </PERSON>, 45, <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> senior vice president for corporate development; <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Morosky </PERSON>, 46, president of <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Allied </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> who will become chairman and chief executive of <PERSON> Federated </PERSON> and Allied; and <PERSON> Carolyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Buck </PERSON> <PERSON> Luce </PERSON>, 35, senior vice president of <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Allied </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION>. A Federated representative said no decision on which of the current directors will resign would be made until <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> takes control of the company. At least two of the three <PERSON> Federated </PERSON> directors who remain on the board will be picked from <PERSON> Federated </PERSON>'s non-management directors, according to <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION>'s tender offer document sent to shareholders. <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION>'s offering to shareholders also disclosed that on April 1, when <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Federated </PERSON> reached the merger agreement, <PERSON> Federated </PERSON> representatives estimated the company had lost $ 20 million before taxes during February. <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> said that was higher than the $ 10 million to $ 15 million loss <PERSON> Federated </PERSON> projected to <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> on Feb. 28 when they were negotiating a merger before <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> R.H. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Macy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> made a bid for <PERSON> Federated </PERSON>. <PERSON> Federated </PERSON> also projected that income before taxes for March and April would be between $ 35 million and $ 76 million, <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> said.

<TEXT>
 Shareholders of <ORGANIZATION> Societe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Generale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> de </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Belgique </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> SA </ORGANIZATION> meet Thursday to seal the fate of the company that is older than <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION> and controls a third of its economy. The meeting also will decide the fate of the 3-month-old hostile bid of Italian industrialist-financier <ORGANIZATION> Carlo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> De </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Benedetti </ORGANIZATION>, which has bogged down in a swamp of legal, political and managerial conflicts. <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Benedetti </PERSON>'s offer rocked the company, long home to the blue-blooded cream of <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>'s business leaders and one in which Belgian royalty and the <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> are said to have shares. <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Benedetti </PERSON>, head of <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Olivetti </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> SpA </ORGANIZATION>, claims he and his allies own as much as 49 percent of shares in 166-year-old <ORGANIZATION> Societe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Generale </ORGANIZATION>. His bid has spawned a rival alliance led by <ORGANIZATION> Cie. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financiere </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> de </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Suez </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Groupe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> AG </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>'s biggest insurer, that claims a 50.7 percent stake. After months of conflicting statements and claims, the extraordinary shareholders meeting which <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Benedetti </PERSON> called must show who owns what exactly. Analysts say the meeting may turn into a peace conference or a showdown. `` Anything is possible,'' said <PERSON> Maurice </PERSON> <PERSON> Lippens </PERSON>, head of <ORGANIZATION> Groupe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> AG </ORGANIZATION>. Some 1,000 shareholders and 200 journalists are to attend the meeting in a specially built tent at the company's headoffice. <PERSON> Lippens </PERSON> has said <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Benedetti </PERSON> must agree to share in management of <ORGANIZATION> Societe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Generale </ORGANIZATION>, not run it. But <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Benedetti </PERSON> has said he seeks a free hand in <ORGANIZATION> Societe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Generale </ORGANIZATION> which has stakes in some 1,300 companies around the globe active in just about every field of industrial endeavor. He wants to turn the company into a pan-European holding before 1992 when the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> is to remove borders within the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> and, with it, a thicket of regulatory restrictions. His search for control is entirely in character. Early in his career, <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Benedetti </PERSON>, 53, left the board of <ORGANIZATION> Fiat </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> SpA </ORGANIZATION> when it was too slow in adopting his ideas for change. He went to <ORGANIZATION> Olivetti </ORGANIZATION> whose fortunes he turned around after taking control of the Italian office automation giant. The battle for <ORGANIZATION> Societe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Generale </ORGANIZATION> has drawn companies from eight nations into the fray in a hodge-podge of coalitions. <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Suez </ORGANIZATION> has a stake of 30 percent of the shares. Its main partner is <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Groupe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> AG </ORGANIZATION> which only has a share of 3.78 percent. In all, the AG-Suez camp totals a dozen or so Belgian, French, <LOCATION> Luxembourg </LOCATION> and Swiss firms. <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Benedetti </PERSON>'s allies include <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION> of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and other <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>, Swiss and Australian finance companies. He has created a holding company for some of the shares in his stable to attract major European companies. The Swiss food giant <ORGANIZATION> Nestle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> SA </ORGANIZATION> has agreed to buy into it and <ORGANIZATION> Philips </ORGANIZATION>, the Dutch communications and electronics company, may follow suit. The confrontation over <ORGANIZATION> Societe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Generale </ORGANIZATION> is more than just counting heads. For one thing, the target was long considered untouchable. <ORGANIZATION> Societe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Generale </ORGANIZATION> was founded 1822 by <PERSON> King </PERSON> <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> I </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION>, eight years before <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION> became independent of Dutch rule and for years was <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>'s central bank. Today, its interests extend to mining, energy, financial services, chemicals and engineering and its estimated worth is $ 3 billion. <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Benedetti </PERSON>'s bid led <ORGANIZATION> Societe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Generale </ORGANIZATION> to isse 12 million new shares. This has sparked several court cases which will likely take years to produce a final settlement and adding confusion to a takeover bid already riddled with complex alliances. <PERSON> Andre </PERSON> <PERSON> Leysen </PERSON>, head of <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Gevaert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, a one-time rival but now an ally of <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Benedetti </PERSON>, has called the saga `` ` <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>,' but without women,'' referring to the popular American television series.

 <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> was granted a patent for a genetically altered mouse today, the first time a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> patent has been issued for an animal. The laboratory mice were altered to make them more susceptible to cancer, and have been in use in experiments at <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> since 1984, said <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Lilliam </PERSON> <PERSON> Blacker </PERSON>. Patent Commissioner <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Quigg </PERSON> said using the animal will simplify cancer research and make it easier to test both cancer-causing substances and chemicals that fight cancer. The action drew fire from <PERSON> Jeremy </PERSON> <PERSON> Rifkin </PERSON>, who heads a coalition of groups opposed to genetic engineering. He termed the action a usurpation of power by the <ORGANIZATION> Patent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>, noting that there have been discussions in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> of imposing a moratorium on such patents until ethical questions can be worked out. <PERSON> Quigg </PERSON>, however, said that the patent application, which was filed in 1984, met the legal criteria for a patent, and so one was issued. Ethical questions, he said, need to be settled in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the medical laboratories, not the Patent Office. While this was the first patent on an animal, plants and forms of bacteria have been patented previously. The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in 1980 ruled that man-made life organisms could be patented, but the <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> patent is the first to protect a genetic change in a higher life form. The patent was issued to <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, with the inventors listed as <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Leder </PERSON> and <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON>. <PERSON> Quigg </PERSON> said his office has 21 other applications for animal patents pending. Details could not be disclosed, however, he said. He said that virtually any changed animal could be patented, except humans. Patents allow the inventor the exclusive right to use a product for 17 years, although in practice the patent holder usually licenses use of the product for a fee. `` This opens the floodgates for a whole range of patents, from fish to house pets,'' said <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Doyle </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Policy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, which supports a moratorium on animal patents. But <PERSON> Geoffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Karny </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> patent attorney, said the action was `` not a radical departure from existing policy.'' `` Granting a patent on animals is an entirely logical application of existing patent law principles, and in many respects is nothing different from what society has been doing with regard to the commercial ownership of animals for thousands of years.''

 Share prices ended slightly lower in thin, featureless trading Tuesday, as investors awaited news from a meeting of monetary officials of the Group of Seven major industrialized nations. The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index was down 5.2 points, or 0.3 percent, at 1,805.3 at the close. Volume was scant at 364.7 million shares, down from 405.4 million on Monday. Shares traded in positive territory for much of the day but fell off in the afternoon on lack of buying interest. Prices also were weakened by market rumors, later denied, that <ORGANIZATION> Tesco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION>, a major British supermarket chain, would launch a new share issue Wednesday when it reports its 1987 earnings. Recently announced share issues have depressed share values. Share prices got little help from the British pound's continued retreat against both the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar and the West German mark, which boosted shares Monday. One dealer said, `` People are awaiting more news on the <ORGANIZATION> G-7 </ORGANIZATION> meeting,'' to take place Wednesday in conjunction with a meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monetary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. There was little corporate news to move the market. Among the 100-share index stocks, 58 were lower, 14 were unchanged and 28 showed gains.

<HEAD>Trump Rejects Griffin's Planned $105 Million Tender Offer for
Resorts</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Entertainer-businessman <PERSON> Merv </PERSON> <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON> stepped up the pressure Tuesday in his attempt to gain control of <ORGANIZATION> Resorts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, announcing he will make a $ 105 million tender offer for a majority of the company's stock. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> investor <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>, who controls 88 percent of the hotel-casino operator's voting power, rejected the offer out of hand, calling it `` a feeble and futile attempt to recast his prior offers to further confuse the marketplace.'' The $ 36-per-share offer to stockholders, to be initiated within the next five days, follows <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON>'s March 30 offer to management to acquire all of Resorts' Class A common shares. The earlier offer also is for $ 36 a share. `` Our new tender offer would effectively give Resorts' Class A shareholders the opportunity to vote on <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON>'s March 30 bid now,'' said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Nigris </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Griffin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co </ORGANIZATION>. The offer would carry the condition that at least 2.9 million shares be offered, a majority of the 5.7 million shares of Class A. Other conditions are that Resorts' board approve the merger and that it agree to sell <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON> 1.2 million newly issued shares of Class B stock for $ 36 a share. The Class B stock carries 100 votes per share while the Class A carries one vote per share. The last condition, also part of <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON>'s original offer, would require the company to issue additional Class B stock and would give him more voting strength than <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>. <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> owns 95 percent of the 572,000 Class B shares that presently exist. In his response, <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> again made clear he has no intention of sharing control of the company with <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON>, the former talk show host who has built a private entertainment and real estate empire. `` Mr. <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> explained that Mr. <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON>'s latest offer contained nothing new and is still contingent upn Mr. <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>'s aproval, an approval which will never be granted,'' his news release said. A special committee of Resorts' management met with a <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON> representative Friday to discuss his efforts to buy the company, but resolved nothing, said <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> <PERSON> Freeman </PERSON>, executive vice president of the Trump organization and a director of Resorts.

 The stock market advanced to a post-crash high today in a late wave of buying spurred by computerized trading, a firmer dollar and rebounding bond prices. The Dow Jones industrial average surged to close firmly above the 2,100 mark for the first time since the market collapsed almost six months ago. Analysts noted the Dow average had flirted with the psychological barrier on several recent occasions, but investors shed their inhibitions when the key market barometer held above that level in mid-afternoon. Stock prices were mixed earlier in the session and the market appeared to lack direction despite its sound underpinnings. Many investors sat on the sidelines awaiting fresh economic data due out later this week. Those who were waiting for new statistics from the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, scheduled to release February's merchandise trade data on Thursday, missed the market's latest uptick, analysts said. `` A lot of people are going to play it close to the vest until they see some direction from the numbers coming out,'' said <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Vandenberg </PERSON>, a vice president at <ORGANIZATION> Smith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Barney </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Harris </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Upham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>.

 <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Paper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday its first-quarter profit jumped 76.7 percent as revenue rose 27.8 percent, reflecting strong demand for all of its major products. The company said it earned $ 159 million, or $ 1.38 a share, in the first three months of 1988 compared with $ 90 million, or 82 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue for the first quarter rose to $ 2.3 billion from $ 1.8 billion in 1987. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Georges </PERSON>, chairman and chief executive, said prices for most of the company's products are `` holding firm or increasing.'' `` Demand across our major products lines _ white papers, coated papers, containerboard, bleached board, pulp and lumber _ remains strong,'' he said. He said the sales increase also reflected the benefits of recent acquisitions, and that earnings should continue to improve from last year if the economy remains strong.

 The chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Batus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> told the nation's third largest home and auto insurer Tuesday his company is ready to open friendly merger talks and boost its $ 4.35 billion takeover offer. <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Sheehy </PERSON> made the proposal in a letter sent to representatives of the <ORGANIZATION> Farmers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, which is based in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. On Monday, <ORGANIZATION> Farmers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> had indicated that it is willing to open talks with Batus under certain conditions. In over-the-counter trading, <ORGANIZATION> Farmers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> edged up 12 -LCB- cents a share to close at $ 65 a share. <PERSON> Sheehy </PERSON> said the Louisville-based <ORGANIZATION> Batus </ORGANIZATION>, a subsidiary of the British retailing, tobacco and financial services concern <ORGANIZATION> BAT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION>, was prepared to pay more than its current bid of $ 63 per share `` in a friendly negotiated transaction.'' <ORGANIZATION> Farmers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> had about 69.7 million shares of common stock outstanding as of April 1. <ORGANIZATION> Batus </ORGANIZATION> already owns 696,000 shares of Farmers stock, putting the value of its offer for the stock it does not own at $ 4.35 billion. <PERSON> Sheehy </PERSON> also said <ORGANIZATION> Batus </ORGANIZATION> would like to receive the same confidential information that Farmers had made available to other parties. <PERSON> Sheehy </PERSON> asked, however, that the confidentiality agreement be modified to ensure `` that there would be no unreasonable restrictions on the freedom of <ORGANIZATION> Batus </ORGANIZATION> to pursue its offer if negotiations failed, and that a fully level playing field would be established between <ORGANIZATION> Batus </ORGANIZATION> and any other potential acquirer.'' <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Welch </PERSON>, director of corporate investments for Farmers, said `` the next step will be for our attorneys to look over their request for a modification of the agreement. Then, we will respond to them but I do n't know when that will be.'' Farmers has scheduled its annual meeting for May 20. The company has been resisting overtures from <ORGANIZATION> Batus </ORGANIZATION>' overtures but altered its position Monday in a letter from <PERSON> Leo </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Denlea </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, chairman and chief executive officer. <PERSON> Denlea </PERSON> said the board of directors would consider a bid from Batus only if `` you are prepared to state unequivocally that <ORGANIZATION> Batus </ORGANIZATION> is, in fact, prepared to offer a higher price and, if so, what that price is. I am requesting hereby that you advise us without delay of any higher offer you are prepared to make.'' <PERSON> Denlea </PERSON>'s letter also offered to share confidential information disclosed to other potential suitors if <ORGANIZATION> Batus </ORGANIZATION> agreed to confidentiality guidelines. `` You should be aware that at this point, Farmers' board of directors has made no decision to pursue a sale of the company,'' <PERSON> Denlea </PERSON> wrote. `` That possibility is, as you may expect, under continuous review. Depending on your response to the request made herein, and other circumstances, the board of directors may or may not revise its decision.'' <ORGANIZATION> Batus </ORGANIZATION>, with businesses in retail sales, tobacco and paper goods, made an unsolicited $ 63-a-share offer for Farmers on March 3. Last week, <PERSON> Sheehy </PERSON> said the company would consider increasing its offer if Farmers management would agree to negotiate. BAT has been seeking a foothold in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> financial services market for some time.

<HEAD>Dollar Steadies in Quiet Trading; Gold Rises</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The dollar rose in quiet trading Tuesday as foreign exchange markets waited for a key finance ministers' meeting and the release of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade deficit figures Gold prices were mixed. <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> quoted a late bid of $ 450.20 for a troy ounce of gold, down 50 cents from $ 450.70 Monday. Traders said there was little foreign exchange activity in advance of Wednesday's meeting of finance ministers from the seven major industrialized countries and the release of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade figures for February on Thursday. In the meantime, the dollar was `` holding up very well, going nowhere,'' said <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolicki </PERSON>, a trader with <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. The finance ministers are expected to discuss the dollar. West German Finance Minister <PERSON> Gerhard </PERSON> <PERSON> Stoltenberg </PERSON> has said they are likely to reaffirm December's agreement on economic-policy cooperation and the stabilization of exchange rates. The trade figures are considered key to the dollar's direction because the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration has supported a lower dollar as a way to cut the trade deficit. When the dollar is down, imports are more expensive, but <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> goods become cheaper overseas. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Holland </PERSON>, a trader at <ORGANIZATION> Discount </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, said the dollar also was boosted partly by technical factors, but also spurted upward on the news that a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> marine had been shot and killed in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. Traders consider the dollar a safe haven during times of political uncertainty. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, the British pound declined to $ 1.8515 from $ 1.8560 late Monday. In later <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> trading, the pound fell to $ 1.8468 from $ 1.86075. Other late dollar rates in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, compared with late Monday's prices, included: 1.68945 West German marks, up from 1.68115; 1.39875 Swiss francs, up from 1.3914; 5.7255 French francs, up from 5.71375; 1,275.375 Italian lire, up from 1,246.45; and 1.23705 Canadian dollars, down from 1.24015 Other late dollar rates in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, compared with late Monday's rates, included: 1.6853 West German marks, down from 1.6855; 1.3967 Swiss francs, up from 1.3953; 5.7165 French francs, up from 5.7145; 1.8890 Dutch guilders, down from 1.8910; 1,249.75 Italian lire, up from 1,249.50; and 1.2370 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2390 In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, the dollar rose to a closing 126.50 Japanese yen from 125.71 yen at Monday's close. Later, in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, the dollar was quoted at 126.49 yen, and in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, it rose to 126.685 yen from 126.175 yen. The price of gold bullion fell on the <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, where it closed at $ 450.90 a troy ounce, compared with $ 452.80 late Monday. Gold rose in thin trading in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> to a late bid price of $ 451 an ounce, up from a bid of $ 449.50 late Monday. In <LOCATION> Zurich </LOCATION>, gold also rose to $ 451 an ounce, up from $ 449 bid late Monday.

 The stock market hit a post-crash high Tuesday in its sixth straight advance, helped by a late wave of computerized buying. The Dow Jones industrial average surged to close firmly above the 2,100 mark for the first time since the stock market collapsed almost six months ago. Computer-triggered buy programs, a firmer dollar and rebounding bond prices all were credited with spurring the advance. The Dow average of 30 industrials jumped 14.09 points to 2,110.08, bringing its gain in the week-old rally to a total of about 130 points. Broader market gauges also moved upward. Gaining issues outnumbered losers by about 7 to 5 on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, with 879 up, 621 down and 471 unchanged. <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> volume totaled 140.40 million shares, against 146.37 million shares in the previous session. The <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION>'s composite index gained 0.72 to 153.19. Analysts noted that volume remained extremely light, initially indicating a lack of investor enthusiasm but then serving to accentuate the move upward once buyers stepped in. Stocks were mixed early in the session, and the market appeared to lack direction. The Dow average tentatively touched 2,100 around noon but quickly retreated. It was not until the key market barometer held above that level in mid-afternoon that investors discarded their inhibitions over equities. `` When the Dow went above 2,100 decisively, it attracted new buyers,'' said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Metz </PERSON>, a vice president and technical analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Oppenheimer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co </ORGANIZATION>. The 2,100 mark had become somewhat of a psychological barrier. The Dow average flirted with that level on several recent occasions, but investors seemed reluctant to make it stick. `` A lot of market watchers are getting nervous that they missed something on the upside,'' <PERSON> Metz </PERSON> said referring to the many investors who sat on the sidelines awaiting fresh economic data due out later this week. `` A lot of people have missed this move,'' he said. Some inactive investors hoped the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s release of February's merchandise trade data on Thursday would lend clues to the state of the economy. Many were playing it `` close to the vest until they see some direction from the numbers coming out,'' said <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Vandenberg </PERSON>, a vice president at <ORGANIZATION> Smith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Barney </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Harris </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Upham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Co. Besides the trade figures, retail sales figures were due out Wednesday, the same day the so-called <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Seven </ORGANIZATION> industrialized nations was set to hold a meeting that could have implications for the dollar. Among actively traded issues, <ORGANIZATION> Honda </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> was the exception in an otherwise lackluster auto sector, jumping 4 to 147 -LCB-. Aircraft issues were mixed. <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> was unchanged at 47 -RRB-. The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> said it would conduct an investigation into alleged defects in the some of the company's wide-body jets Electronic issues were mostly higher, with <ORGANIZATION> Honeywell </ORGANIZATION> up 1 -RRB- to 70; <ORGANIZATION> Kyocera </ORGANIZATION> up 2 \ to 90, and <PERSON> Matsushita </PERSON> up 3 -RRB- to 226 Oil stocks were widely higher, with <ORGANIZATION> Chevron </ORGANIZATION> up 1 -LCB- to 50 -RCB-, <ORGANIZATION> Mobil </ORGANIZATION> up 1 -LRB- to 49 -LRB- and <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Richfield </LOCATION> up 1 -LRB- to 90 -RRB-. Oil prices hit a four-month high in the second day of a rally inspired by <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> efforts to rein in supplies. As measured by <ORGANIZATION> Wilshire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION>' index of more than 5,000 actively traded stocks, the market increased $ 12.47 billion, or 0.47 percent, in value. Nationwide turnover in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter market, totaled 171.75 million shares. <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Poor's index of 400 industrials rose 1.45 to 316.16, and <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; P's 500-stock composite index was up 1.21 to 271.37.

 A former top salesman for <ORGANIZATION> US </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sprint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> told stockholders of one of the company's parent corporations Tuesday that <ORGANIZATION> US </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sprint </ORGANIZATION> is rife with mismanagement and he should become its president. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Walton </PERSON>, who last year received a $ 1.74 million settlement from <ORGANIZATION> US </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sprint </ORGANIZATION> over unpaid commissions, said <ORGANIZATION> US </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sprint </ORGANIZATION>'s management is `` totally out of touch'' with the telecommunications industry. `` Management's thinking is years behind the times,'' <PERSON> Walton </PERSON> said in an interview following the annual meeting of <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telecommunications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Westwood </LOCATION>, a suburb of <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telecom </ORGANIZATION> is joint owner of <ORGANIZATION> US </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sprint </ORGANIZATION> with <ORGANIZATION> GTE </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Stamford </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Walton </PERSON>, a 32-year-old former school teacher from <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION>, has campaigned from college campuses to Wall Street in an attempt to oust <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Snedaker </PERSON> as president of <ORGANIZATION> US </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sprint </ORGANIZATION> He's also calling attention to billing problems that have plagued the company since its formation in 1986. Because <ORGANIZATION> US </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sprint </ORGANIZATION>'s president is not elected but is chosen by a six-member partnership committee of <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telecom </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> GTE </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Walton </PERSON> wants shareholders to pressure company officials to put him in charge. <PERSON> Walton </PERSON> got a cool reception from the approximately 200 people attending the meeting. `` I think he means well but <ORGANIZATION> Sprint </ORGANIZATION> is showing signs of coming around,'' said <PERSON> Marvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Bell </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Lenexa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kan. </LOCATION>, a shareholder. `` What he's saying really is n't an issue any more.'' <LOCATION> US </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sprint </LOCATION>, based in <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo. </LOCATION>, is the nation's third-largest long-distance telephone company behind <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telegraph </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> MCI </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> US </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sprint </ORGANIZATION> lost $ 1.1 billion last year on revenues of $ 3.1 billion. Analysts have predicted that the company would lose from $ 115 million to $ 140 million in the quarter that ended March 31. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Esrey </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telecom </ORGANIZATION>'s president and chief executive officer, conceded Tuesday that <ORGANIZATION> US </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sprint </ORGANIZATION>'s losses for the first quarter of 1988 likely would be more than the $ 116 million loss in the last quarter of 1987. <LOCATION> US </LOCATION> Sprint probably wo n't turn a profit in 1988 but its losses should decline in 1988, <PERSON> Esrey </PERSON> said. He told stockholders that <ORGANIZATION> US </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sprint </ORGANIZATION>'s fiber-optic long-distance telephone network and other technological advancements would boost its share of the market and help trim losses. <PERSON> Esrey </PERSON> also said the billing problems _ some customers were n't billed for months or have been charged for calls they did n't make _ have been cleared up However, <PERSON> Walton </PERSON>, who was fired in July 1986 after sending a letter to <PERSON> Esrey </PERSON> complaining about customer service and not receiving commissions on some of the 600,000 Sprint accounts he had signed up, challenged <PERSON> Esrey </PERSON>'s remarks. `` Everywhere I go, people come up to me and tell me horror stories about <ORGANIZATION> US </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sprint </ORGANIZATION>,'' he said. `` Their service has n't been connected, they do n't receive bills, they're billed for calls they do n't make or a collection agency is after them because of company-caused errors. There's just no excuse.'' <PERSON> Esrey </PERSON> declined to comment on <PERSON> Walton </PERSON>'s charges, but agreed with <PERSON> Walton </PERSON> that the price of the company's stock should be higher. <PERSON> Walton </PERSON> said he also will appear at <ORGANIZATION> GTE </ORGANIZATION>'s stockholders' meeting April 20. <PERSON> Walton </PERSON> and his supporters have handed out T-shirts, buttons and bumper stickers promoting his candidacy, which he expects to cost $ 60,000. `` It's clear that they do n't know the best ways of running the company,'' he said. `` I'm willing to roll up my sleeves and work 18-hour days, seven days a week, like I once did for this company. We need a change in management, change in direction and an entrepreneurial approach.''

<HEAD>Pork Belly Futures Plummet; High Supply Levels Cited</HEAD>

 Oil prices surged for the second straight day Tuesday on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, closing above the $ 18-a-barrel barrier for the first time in four months. In other markets, frozen pork bellies plunged the limit allowed for daily trading on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>; livestock futures fell; copper futures fell sharply and precious metals retreated slightly; grains and soybeans were mixed; and stock-index futures moved higher. Crude futures were supported by unconfirmed rumors that the trans-Panama pipeline would be shut down and by the <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exporting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Countries </ORGANIZATION>' recent moves to reduce world oil output, analysts said. West Texas Intermediate crude oil, up a sharp $ 1.01 a barrel on Monday, settled 19 cents to 20 cents higher with May at $ 18.09 a barrel. It was the first time oil for the near-month contract closed over $ 18 since a Dec. 11 close of $ 18.31. Heating oil was 1.03 cents to 1.32 cents higher with May at 48.91 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was .75 cent to 1.12 cents higher with May at 52.07 cents a gallon. Frozen pork belly futures plunged on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, in a selloff sparked by a continuing unusually high amount of bellies in cold storage. Large amounts of pork bellies have been moved into cold storage due to weak demand by bacon producers, and pessimistic traders expected a report issued after Tuesday's close to show the trend continuing, analysts said. The <ORGANIZATION> Merc </ORGANIZATION>'s weekly report on out-of-town storage showed more than 68 million pounds of pork bellies stored in freezers outside of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> compared with about 21.9 million pounds a year ago. The figure represented an increase of about 2 million pounds during the past week. Traders, expecting an increase of 2.5 million to 3.2 million pounds, had bid the contracts for May and July delivery down the daily limit of 2 cents a pound. Selling in pork bellies spread to hog futures, which finished significantly lower. Cattle futures slumped in response to slack demand on cash markets, analysts said. Live cattle settled .52 cent to 1.25 cents lower with the contract for delivery in April at 74.75 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .65 cent to 1.20 cents lower with April at 80.02 cents a pound; hogs were .20 cent to .75 cent lower with April at 54.65 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were 1 cent to 2 cents lower with May at 53.02 cents a pound. Copper prices fell for a second straight day on <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, with all contracts settling below $ 1 a pound for the first time since March 8 The contract for May delivery plunged 4.55 cents, settling at 95.65 cents a pound. Gold and silver futures retreated slightly, responding to the stronger dollar, said <PERSON> Bette </PERSON> <PERSON> Raptopoulos </PERSON>, a metals analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Prudential-Bache </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Gold settled $ 1 to $ 1.90 lower with June at $ 453.70 a troy ounce and May silver fell 4.5 cents to at $ 6.425 a troy ounce. Soybean futures closed lower on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> as profit-taking erased some of last week's sharp gains. Corn futures retreated in sympathy with soybeans, while wheat rose on reports that <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> were seeking to buy <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> wheat under the government's subsidized export sales program, said <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> <PERSON> Karlin </PERSON>, a research analyst for <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. Wheat settled unchanged to 2 -RCB- cents higher with May at $ 3.20 \ a bushel; corn was 1 -LCB- cents lower to \ cent higher with May at $ 2.06 \ a bushel; oats were \ cent to 1 -LCB- cents lower with May at $ 1.66 -LCB- a bushel; soybeans were 1 -LCB- cents to 3 -LCB- cents lower with May at $ 6.79 \ Stock-index futures advanced on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, where the contract for June delivery of the <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Poor's 500 index settled 1.35 points higher at 272.55.

 The fiscal 1989 budget hides the true size of the federal deficit because it factors in huge surpluses from the Social Security system and other programs, senators said Tuesday while considering the $ 1.1 trillion spending plan. By an 85-8 vote, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> gave preliminary approval to an amendment to the budget urging the lawmakers to discount the surpluses amassed by two funds set aside for highway and aviation projects when calculating the federal deficit. The two funds have a combined projected surplus of $ 2 billion for next year. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> budget blueprint officially predicts the deficit problem is easing. But under an amendment offered by Sen. <PERSON> Lawton </PERSON> <PERSON> Chiles </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Fla </LOCATION>., chairman of the budget committee, the mammoth surplus the Social Security program accumulates each year would no longer be counted when figuring the federal deficit That amendment could be voted on as early as Wednesday. `` The deficit is heading up, not down,'' said <PERSON> Chiles </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> budget, which <PERSON> Chiles </PERSON> helped write, predicts the red ink will shrink to $ 136 billion in the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1, a drop of more than $ 10 billion from the amount anticipated in the current fiscal year. However, that counts a $ 46 billion surplus in Social Security, which is expected to grow even larger through the beginning of the next century. The funds then would be expended when the Baby Boom generation reaches retirement age. Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Heinz </PERSON>, R-Pa., said that even if the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and president meet their promise under the Gramm-Rudman law for a balanced budget by fiscal 1993, the deficit that year actually would be more than $ 100 billion if the Social Security surplus is n't counted Sen. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>, R-Wash., said he thought the amendment was an inadequate gesture and that major revisions of the federal accounting system were needed, not just non-binding legislative language There was less debate about the substance of the budget, which would carry out the mandate of last fall's deficit-reduction agreement between President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and congressional leaders. The spending plan, like the agreement, calls for $ 294 billion in military spending, $ 16.1 billion for foreign assistance and $ 169.2 billion for domestic agencies, outside of entitlements and other programs set by automatic formulas. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> plan features a 27 percent increase in spending on the space program and big boosts in AIDS research, both requested by <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. Education would receive $ 1.2 billion, a 7.4 percent boost. Like the president's plan, the budget does n't call for new taxes beyond the $ 14 billion for fiscal 1988 which was enacted last December. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> plan also calls for: _ A 4.3 percent pay increase for the military and 2 percent for civilian federal workers <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> had requested the different pay boosts, but the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> voted for 3 percent across the board. _ $ 500 million for more farm commodities for the poor, to replace exhausted surplus stocks. _ Expansion of Medicaid health program and enactment of Medicare catastrophic illness insurance, assuming fees raised to pay for them _ An 11 percent increase for <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> for its research programs and a 25 percent increase in <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> nuclear physics program, toward development of the superconducting super collider project _ A 3 percent cut in rural housing assistance, along with reductions in elderly housing and community and regional development _ Aviation safety increase of 19 percent from $ 5.5 billion this year, to hire 900 more air traffic controllers and modernize the system The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> budget, approved last month, also follows the overall budget guidelines of last fall but it differs in detail from the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> plan. For example, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> voted to spend more on aid to local communities and less on space than the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> plan. The two chambers must agree on a single spending plan, after which it serves as a guide for regular fiscal legislation. The budget is a congressional resolution that does not require the president's signature. The official deadline for completing the budget is Friday. Although <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> is unlikely to meet that target, this year's budget action is coming at the earliest dates in years

 <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Point-Pepperell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> reported Tuesday its net income declined 2.1 percent in its second quarter, although income from continuing operations rose 22.4 percent. The West Point-based company, which is involved in a billion-dollar bidding war for rival textile giant <ORGANIZATION> J.P. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stevens </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, reported net income of $ 15.3 million, or 51 cents per share, in the quarter ended March 26. That compared with a profit of $ 15.6 million, or 53 cents per share, in the same quarter last year. Sales for the quarter totaled $ 459.9 million, up 12 percent from $ 410.4 million in the year-earlier quarter. Income from continuing operations rose to $ 18.6 million from $ 15.2 million a year earlier. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lanier </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr </PERSON>, chairman and chief executive officer, stated the rise in operating earnings stemmed from solid sales increases in knit apparel fabrics and in the company's bed and bath lines and from lower tax rates in 1988. <PERSON> Lanier </PERSON> said the company had an after-tax charge of $ 3.3 million against a gain on the sale of discontinued carpet operations. West Point sold substantially all of its assets of its carpet and rug division last November to <ORGANIZATION> Shaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. For the first six months of its fiscal year, <ORGANIZATION> Pepperell </ORGANIZATION> reported net income of $ 40.9 million, up 11.8 percent from the previous period's $ 36.6 million Per-share earnings rose to $ 1.34 from $ 1.25 in the previous quarter.

<HEAD>Greenspan: Banking Reserves Must Be Increased To Handle Global
Market</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The hazards of deregulated banking on a global scale demand that banks increase their reserves, <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> said Tuesday. <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> said the need for bigger bank reserves was underscored last year when major banks took big losses because of reserves set aside to cover bad loans to <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. For some banks, those moves erased most of a decade's worth of growth in their capital reserves. Such losses might be digested by healthy banks in a stable domestic economy, <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> said. But the volatile nature of international lending and increasing bank involvement in real estate, insurance and securities brokering demanded a bigger safety net, he told the <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supervisors </ORGANIZATION>. Last December, federal banking officials and supervisory officials from the 10 largest industrialized nations jointly proposed establishing uniform international capital requirements. The plan would set an internationally accepted minimum equity capital requirement and a menu of acceptable non-traditional assets that could supplement a bank's equity base. <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> said the plan should be viewed as a crude first step in focusing attention on the need for additional reserves. `` Some revisions may be required over time, but it provides an important base to allow bank organizations to adapt in years ahead,'' <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Western Union To Cut More Than 1,800 Workers In Restructuring</HEAD>
<DATELINE>UPPER SADDLE RIVER, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Western </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> will lay off about 1,800 workers, some 25 percent of its work force, by the end of this year as part of its financial restructuring, the company said Tuesday. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Amman </PERSON>, president and chief executive officer, also said the company had established five separate business units under the restructuring. <ORGANIZATION> Western </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>'s restructuring plan, completed Dec. 30, included the $ 178 million acquisition of <ORGANIZATION> ITT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, an exchange of debt for stock and the borrowing of about $ 500 million through the sale of high-interest debentures. The plan was aimed at helping keep the communications company afloat after years of major financial losses. Western Union officials have said that without the restructuring the company would have had to file for bankruptcy protection. The layoffs will affect workers in all parts of the combined company, spokesman <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> <PERSON> Bechtel </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> Amman </LOCATION> said in a news release that the creation of separate business units, to operate on a stand-alone basis, and the integration of <ORGANIZATION> ITT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> into <ORGANIZATION> Western </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> `` are the first steps in implementing our strategic plan to make the company more profitable.'' The business largest unit, business communications services, oversees the company's international and domestic telex and electronic mail service. Money transfer services and mailgram and telegram message services are handled by another division. The consumer communications and financial services unit will coordinate the nationwide network of 11,000 <ORGANIZATION> Western </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> agents and the company's centralized telephone bureaus A third division, priority mail services, is responsible for commercial mailgram messages, priority letters and computer letters to business and special interest groups. Western Union's advanced transmission systems supervises construction and operation of local and regional fiber optic transmission facilities for corporate customers and other communications carriers. The fifth unit is responsible for national marketing of <ORGANIZATION> Western </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>'s long distance and leased transmission servicees, along with the company's international leased line business and satellite service. <ORGANIZATION> Western </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> earned $ 88.1 million in 1987 on revenue of $ 802 million, <ORGANIZATION> Bechtel </ORGANIZATION> said.
