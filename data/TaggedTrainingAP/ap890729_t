<TEXT>
 Gov. <PERSON> Cecil </PERSON> <PERSON> Andrus </PERSON> declared a state of extreme emergency Friday, putting military reinforcements on call to help the battle against hundreds of forest fires burning out of control. The emergency proclamation, which allows the state to use the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION>, will last for 30 days or until the fire danger subsides. The <ORGANIZATION> Boise </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Interagency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> estimated about 3,000 people were working as firefighters or support personnel to battle 15,000 acres of <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> fires. The weather cooperated in northern <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> with high humidity that slowed the flames, while the opposite was true for the <ORGANIZATION> Boise </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION>. `` The humidity dropped considerably,'' said <PERSON> Lynette </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Boise </LOCATION> forest spokeswoman. `` When the air dried out, the fires got up and ran.'' A lightning storm earlier this week covered central <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> with 500 fires, some limited to just a burning tree. Firefighters concentrated on the larger blazes, while parachuting smokejumpers or helicopter-borne crews tackled the small ones. The containment of small fires and shuffling of crews Friday left it difficult to assess total acreage burned or manpower on the fire lines. The top-priority fire in the state was the 1,500-acre <LOCATION> Fleming </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Creek </LOCATION> blaze near Banks, north of <LOCATION> Boise </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Pam </PERSON> <PERSON> Gardner </PERSON>, fire information officer for the <PERSON> Payette </PERSON> forest north of <LOCATION> Boise </LOCATION>. It burned on state and <LOCATION> Boise </LOCATION> forest land. The second fire of concern was the 600-acre Dollar Creek fire near the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fork </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> the </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salmon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> east of <ORGANIZATION> Cascade </ORGANIZATION> because of the chance its destruction of ground cover could lead to erosion into the river. Fire bosses in the <ORGANIZATION> Boise </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Land </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> focused on the 6,500-acre <LOCATION> Deer </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Creek </LOCATION> blaze near <LOCATION> Mann </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Creek </LOCATION> north of <LOCATION> Weiser </LOCATION>, which had tripled in size since Thursday and was burning in critical sharptail grouse habitat. In the <ORGANIZATION> Payette </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION>, about 500 firefighters from all over the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> had contained 70 of 130 fires and the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> erected a temporary tower at the McCall airport to monitor the scores of retardant bombers and smoke jumper planes in the region.

 A federal judge ruled Friday that polygamist clan leader <PERSON> Addam </PERSON> <PERSON> Swapp </PERSON> can appeal his conviction for the bombing of a Mormon chapel, despite his attorney's failure to meet a filing deadline. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Jenkins </PERSON> gave defense attorney <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Bucher </PERSON> an extension for `` excusable neglect'' in filing the appeal in the <ORGANIZATION> 10th </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> a few days late last summer. Meanwhile, federal prosectors said they will appeal <PERSON> Jenkins </PERSON>' sentencing of Swapp and two of his three co-defendants in the Jan. 16, 1988, bombing and a subsequent standoff with authorities that ended in a fatal shootout The violence at the clan's compound ended a standoff with state and federal officials. Corrections Lt. <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> House </PERSON> was killed and <PERSON> Swapp </PERSON> was wounded in the exchange. The impasse had begun 13 days earlier, when <PERSON> Swapp </PERSON> bombed a Mormon chapel near the farm. <PERSON> Bucher </PERSON> filed the appeal after <PERSON> Jenkins </PERSON> sentenced the four last July, but the <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> appellate court returned the matter to <PERSON> Jenkins </PERSON> so he could make a ruling on the late filing. <PERSON> Swapp </PERSON>, his brother <PERSON> Jonathan </PERSON>, his mother-in-law <PERSON> Vickie </PERSON> <PERSON> Singer </PERSON> and her son, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Singer </PERSON>, were convicted of 20 counts of bombing, attempted murder and use of firearms. <PERSON> Jenkins </PERSON>, defying federal mandatory sentencing guidelines governing bombings and firearms which are much stiffer, originally sentenced <PERSON> Swapp </PERSON> to 15 years in prison, Mrs. Singer to five years, and <PERSON> Jonathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Swapp </PERSON> and Singer to 10 years each. Prosecutors, however, appealed the sentences and the 10th Circuit returned the case to <PERSON> Jenkins </PERSON>, who added token additions to the terms of the Swapp brothers and Mrs. Singer. He added no time to Singer's term. Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Lambert </PERSON> said the new appeal would ask for five-year `` firearm enhancement'' terms for Singer and the Swapps, but no additional time for Mrs. Singer, 47, who has dropped her own appeal. The Swapp brothers and Singer also were convicted of state homicide charges in <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>'s death.

<TEXT>
 It's nearly dinner time, the baby is crying and <PERSON> Mister </PERSON> <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON> comes on in five minutes. What's a parent to do? Two <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> entrepreneurs hope the answer is the tot-sized TV dinner. Pop it in the microwave and presto: cod with creamed peas and squash. `` Babies love it and so do grown-ups. It tastes like real food,'' said <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Dootson </PERSON> <PERSON> Pigott </PERSON>, vice president of the <ORGANIZATION> Starting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Right </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and the mother of a 7-year-old. She and company President <PERSON> Cameon </PERSON> <PERSON> Ivarsson </PERSON> said the idea behind the frozen dinners is to start toddlers at 4 months with a balanced and nutritional diet, without exhausting their mothers in the process. The frozen minimeals are being produced and packaged in a <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> specialty-food factory while the entrepreneurs await specially adapted machinery. The meals, being test-marketed in Seattle-area groceries, contain items from the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Northwest </LOCATION> ranging from cod to vegetables. The only additive is a little water for consistency, Ms. <PERSON> Pigott </PERSON> said. The company is starting with four menus in three textures, from smooth to chunky with offerings such as semolina pasta and brown rice, Ms. <PERSON> Pigott </PERSON> said. There is also a vegetarian menu. Each bowl has a cartoon beneath the food to help encourage kids to finish the food so they can see the picture. In each tub, the foods are separate to allow mothers to introduce each item separately to the child. `` It's exactly as if a mom made her own baby food. ... We're not doing weird things, we're doing plain, simple things,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Ivarsson </PERSON>, a Swiss-trained neurophysiologist. In <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>, she fed two boys, now 5 and 8, her homemade baby food. She spent every other weekend cooking and freezing 40 mini-TV dinners. When she moved to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and gave birth to <PERSON> Margaux </PERSON>, now 15 months old, Ms. <PERSON> Ivarsson </PERSON> `` decided to do what every American mother does'' and bought a jar of commercial baby food. The strained carrots, she said, were flavorless. <PERSON> Margaux </PERSON> was n't enthusiastic about the food either, she said So, Ms. <PERSON> Ivarsson </PERSON> formed Starting Right with Ms. <PERSON> Pigott </PERSON>, who has a degree in finance and once owned and operated a restaurant. Doctor friends gave advice about nutrition, and Ms. <PERSON> Ivarsson </PERSON>'s husband, who runs a restaurant helped with business tips If the frozen dinners catch on, the company plans to incorporate regional foods, depending on where the meals are distributed, so babies start out eating foods they'll be served as they grow up. Suggested retail prices range from about $ 1.35 to $ 1.49. Ms. <PERSON> Pigot </PERSON> and Ms. <PERSON> Ivarsson </PERSON> said they're trying to help women who get involved in the business. The board members are women and the majority of the company stockholders are women. `` I do n't know if you'd call it feminist, but our philosophy was that if we have the opportunity to help women, good,'' Ms. <PERSON> Pigott </PERSON> said. The company faces tough competition from other baby food manufacturers, particularly the Fremont, Mich.-based <ORGANIZATION> Gerber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Product </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, which controls 70 percent of the baby food market, said <PERSON> Gerber </PERSON> spokeswoman <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Ivens </PERSON>. <PERSON> Gerber </PERSON>'s baby foods have no additives except water for making puree, Ms. <PERSON> Ivens </PERSON> said. Only the desserts have sugar added and some of the fruits have added vitamin C, she said.

<TEXT>
 A man was found guilty of first-degree murder Friday in the killing of a church volunteer, more than two years after he was captured in the longest manhunt in <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> history. The jury deliberated for 2 -LCB- hours before returning the verdict against <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, 35, in <ORGANIZATION> Phelps </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. The penalty phase of the two-week trial is scheduled to begin at 9:30 a.m. Saturday, and the state is asking for the death penalty. The jury can recommend either death or life imprisonment. <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> Finnical </PERSON>, an assistant attorney general and the lead prosecutor in the case, said testimony from ballistics experts showed the gun <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> had when he was arrested in <LOCATION> Ada </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Okla. </LOCATION>, was the one that killed caretaker <PERSON> Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Long </PERSON> in a Doolittle church on April 1, 1987. `` Circumstantial evidence conclusively _ conclusively _ proves <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> murdered this man,'' <PERSON> Finnical </PERSON> told the jury. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> Brad </PERSON> <PERSON> Kessler </PERSON>, had questioned the validity of the ballistics results. `` What you have here is the state grasping at straws. They have to put someone in the church,'' <PERSON> Kessler </PERSON> said. At the time Long was killed, <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> was the subject of a massive manhunt after a man matching his description fled from a <LOCATION> Rolla </LOCATION> motel room a few days earlier. A police officer was wounded in that incident.

 More than 1,100 descendants of a little bay horse foaled 200 years ago trotted, danced or even popped out of a cake in honor of their breed. <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> breeder <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dayton </PERSON> <PERSON> Sumner </PERSON>, manager of the 50th annual <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> England </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morgan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Horse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Show </ORGANIZATION>, said the six-day spectacle was a sort of homecoming for the first uniquely American breed of horse. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Morgans </ORGANIZATION> appeal is as universal as his versatility,'' said <PERSON> Laura </PERSON> <PERSON> Frizzel </PERSON> of <PERSON> Davison </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, awarding a citation and bottle of champagne to a group of enthusiasts in straw hats and jeans who hitched a trio of high-stepping <ORGANIZATION> Morgans </ORGANIZATION> to a hay wagon and joined the fancy carriage parade through downtown Thursday evening. First prize went to <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> millionaire <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> E.I </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Dupont </ORGANIZATION> and his wife in an ornate antique hunting carriage, drawn by four coal black Morgans. As they rolled smoothly down Main Street one of the three grooms in top hat and tails sounded a cheery flourish on an long, brass hunting horn. Morgans, who are equally at home in hunt clubs, isolated cattle ranches or helping the police maintain order on city streets, reflect the all-around characteristics that endeared them to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> farmers. They wanted and got a horse strong enough to pull a plow, small enough to require little maintenance, and fast enough to ride. A bronze plaque on a granite boulder along a street in suburban <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springfield </LOCATION> a few miles down the <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> marks the beginning of what the inscription simply calls `` that useful breed'' in 1789.

His lineage is unclear, but some <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON> historians believe he may have been sired by a Tory colonel's part-Arabian, part-English thoroughbred stallion `` liberated'' during the Revolutionary War by farmers in retaliation for raids on their livestock.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Newspaper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guild </ORGANIZATION> have reached a tentative five-year contract, three years after the last agreement expired, the newspaper reported Saturday. The contract covers 1,420 newsroom employees and white-collar workers. Management declared negotiations at an impasse two years ago. Members of the <ORGANIZATION> Washington-Baltimore </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Newspaper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guild </ORGANIZATION> will vote on the agreement Monday. The union bargaining committee has recommended ratification. The <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> said the contract would increase weekly salaries between 4 percent and 6 percent, with lower-paid workers receiving a higher percentage increase along with an improvement in minimum-salary scales. Employees who make more than $ 50,000 a year, which includes most of the paper's news and editorial workers, will have increases of about $ 42.50 per week during the first three years of the contract, with similar increases expected in the final two years, the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> said. The agreement also calls for improvements in pension and disability-insurance plans and better medical and dental coverage. It provides several provisions for resolving worker-management disputes and a no-strike, no-lockout clause. The worker-management clause is believed to be the first such clause in the 51 years the Guild has bargained on behalf of <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> employees. The contract covers newsroom, accounting, advertising, circulation and data-processing employees, as well as some workers in other business departments.

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, facing battles with <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on several fronts, says he's standing firm on his military spending plan but is willing to compromise on his proposal to cut the capital gains tax. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> insisted Friday that he will be able to have his way with the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> on his defense package even after the House this week shredded it, slashing key components such as Star Wars, the stealth bomber, mobile MX missile and Midgetman missile. `` I am disappointed that the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> did what they did,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told a news conference, noting that the chamber restored money for some programs he wants to cut. `` Yesterday was not the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>'s most memorable moment, but we're going to keep fighting on for what we believe in. But <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he's willing to look at alternatives on his proposal to cut the 33 percent maximum capital-gains rate to 15 percent. `` If there's some compromise that can spur investment, spur jobs, increase employment _ the cause of new jobs starting up _ I'd be interested in it,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said `` I do n't think I should ever say it's got to be done just this way in terms of the bills up there in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Means </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> right now.'' On another topic, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> decried news leaks in the espionage investigation of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> diplomat <PERSON> Felix </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bloch </PERSON>. `` I do n't want to go into it while it is under investigation,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said when asked about specifics. `` I am very concerned about premature discussion and disclosure _ that means leaks _ on this matter, because I think you can jeopardize the case itself and perhaps the man's ability to get a fair hearing.'' No charges have been filed against <PERSON> Bloch </PERSON>, but the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> revoked his diplomatic passport and put him on paid leave June 22. He is under heavy <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> surveillance. Regarding the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>'s slash of $ 1.8 billion from his $ 4.9 billion military spending request, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> reaffirmed his commitment to his `` solid strategic program.'' He said he will fight to win <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> support to counter the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> measure, and that he needs everything he's proposing to strengthen his arms control position in talks with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also said: _ He's confident his multibillion-dollar bailout plan for the savings and loan industry will prevail, despite a <ORGANIZATION> House-Senate </ORGANIZATION> conference agreement this week that rejected a key funding mechanism on which he has insisted _ Attacks on his nominee to head the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s civil rights division, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON>, are `` pure gut politics. He said he staunchly supports <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON>, who critics say is unqualified. _ He still wants a constitutional amendment to ban burning of the American flag, but did n't answer directly when asked if he would settle for a Democratic-sponsored effort, passed this week by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, to outlaw flag burning through a statute rather than amending the Constitution `` I will see what comes down here, but I will continue to push for the approach that I think is the best, given the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> decision,'' he said. _ He did not condone the kidnapping of a Shiite Moslem leader by <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> commandos in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> and does n't know if it may lead to freedom for an American hostage _ He was frustrated over the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> inability to get Panamanian ruler <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> out of power _ He would not respond to harsh criticisms leveled by outgoing Customs Commissioner <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> von </PERSON> <PERSON> Raab </PERSON>, who said he saw a lack of commitment or interest in the departments of State and <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> on fighting the drug war <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said the real question is, `` How do we do better.?

 Radio is being ill-served by `` voodoo priests'' at the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> who seem to think just about anyone should be able to own a station, a broadcasting lobbyist says. A deregulation-minded <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> has been kind to broadcasters in many ways during the 1980s, but has sometimes gone too far in its rush to impose a free-market ethic, said <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> O. </PERSON> <PERSON> Fritts </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasters </ORGANIZATION>. `` If there were a modern-day <PERSON> Rip </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Winkle </PERSON> broadcaster who had gone to sleep in 1980 and reawakened this year, he would scarcely believe the changes,'' <PERSON> Fritts </PERSON> said in remarks prepared for delivery today at the <ORGANIZATION> Idaho </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasters </ORGANIZATION> meeting in <LOCATION> Sun </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>. `` The entire communications landscape has changed,'' he said. `` Deregulation has come faster and gone farther than our industry ever asked or dreamed of.'' Under <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Fowler </PERSON> and his predecessor, <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON>, the Fairness Doctrine has been lifted and broadcasters received favorable improvements in the license-renewal process. <PERSON> Fritts </PERSON> said broadcasters were grateful for those victories, but that the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> has caused other headaches. Noting that the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> loosened rules for acquiring radio station licenses, <PERSON> Fritts </PERSON> said it appeared the commission had `` become so obsessed with regulation by marketplace economic theory that it seemingly is interested in providing every man, woman and child with their own radio station.'' `` Ole Rip would be surprised that the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> has no apparent concern for preserving the system of local service by financially healthy stations that has served the American public so well for the past 70 years,'' he said. `` Our awakening broadcaster would think his world was being ruled by voodoo priests. `` As a result of the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION>'s Alice-in-Wonderland allocations policies, it is faced with a growing backlog of applications for new facilities and minor station modifications. <PERSON> Fritts </PERSON> said an <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> official acknowledged recently that a new ruling allowing increased power for small FM stations may increase the application backlog from six months to 18 months.

 A former <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> official says he made recommendations that `` ultimately benefited'' people with whom he now works, and a congressman is calling for a <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> investigation. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Monticciolo </PERSON>, former <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> regional administrator for the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION>, was grilled Friday by members of a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee investigating allegations of wrongdoing at <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION>. He denied any wrongdoing during his seven-year <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> tenure, but was harshly questioned by Rep. <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Shays </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Conn </LOCATION>., about a 1984 memo in which <PERSON> Monticciolo </PERSON> had made recommendations about a company he later joined `` I made recommendations to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> that ultimately benefited people who are now partners of mine,'' <PERSON> Monticciolo </PERSON> said, adding that the final decision came from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. `` I'm going to have people look at what you've done because there was a quid pro quo,'' <PERSON> Shays </PERSON> said. `` I'm hopeful and I would expect that the attorney general's office will look into what you've done because you've cashed in.'' Monticciolo is chief executive of <ORGANIZATION> Eagle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Capital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, a real estate development company with contracts in <LOCATION> Rockland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>. Some of the partners were involved in a controversial 1983 deal in which they bought seven <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> properties in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> valued at $ 10.5 million price but put up only $ 550,000. The developers later sold the property, making a reported $ 17 million profit. <PERSON> Monticciolo </PERSON> said he had made recommendations to <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> that benefited the developers, who later hired him for a $ 125,000-a-year job and made him a 15 percent partner for no up-front cash. At one point, <PERSON> Monticciolo </PERSON> told the panel that <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION>'s Section 8 moderate rehabilitation program was `` 50 percent political,'' with half the money going to developers who were <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> contributors or well-connected to the administration. <PERSON> Monticciolo </PERSON> also said he had never recommended a project for that program, which has been suspended.

It was the third time <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> had asked for an extension. Subcommittee Chairman <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Lantos </PERSON>, D-Calif., said the panel would vote Wednesday on issuing a subpoena for <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> to appear Sept. 27 and to produce `` all relevant documents and records.

<HEAD>Dole Offers Compromise All-Crops Disaster Relief Proposal</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BARRY MASSEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 After a week of partisan bickering, farm-state senators are inching toward compromise on legislation to provide federal payments to producers suffering crop losses from drought and other weather-related damage. Senate Republican Leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> dropped his opposition Friday to an across-the-board disaster relief package and offered a proposal that a Democratic leader said could clear the way for a bipartisan agreement. `` Sen. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>'s flexibility will lead to an agreement on a final package that treats all farmers fairly,'' Sen. <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Leahy </PERSON>, D-Vt., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said in a statement `` We are moving toward common ground that fairly covers all demonstrated crop losses within reasonable spending levels.'' <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> had been leading opposition to a Democratic-sponsored measure providing $ 955 million to cover weather-related crop losses. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>'s proposal, estimated to cost $ 891 million, would provide more assistance to farmers of the major grains who bought federal crop insurance and less to the hundreds of other commodities _ the so-called non-program crops _ because they are not covered by federal subsidy and price support programs. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration has said about $ 870 million in agricultural budget savings could be used for farm disaster relief. So far, the dispute in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> has been over what crops should qualify for federal payments. But pressure is building on lawmakers to take action. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> is scheduled to recess Aug. 5 for a month-long vacation, and most farm-state members do n't want to return home without having sent an aid bill to the White House. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> has complained that the Democratic measure, approved by the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> on a party-line vote earlier in the week, was potentially too expensive because it covered more than 500 crops. But he moved closer to the Democratic package Friday with his compromise proposal. Faring best under <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>'s proposal would be producers of wheat, cotton, rice, corn and other crops participating in federal commodity programs and those who bought federal crop insurance. They would be eligible for assistance on losses above 35 percent, with payments covering 65 percent of their lost income. Farmers without crop insurance, but enrolled in the federal farm programs, would have to suffer losses of at least 40 percent, under <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>'s plan. Peanuts, tobacco and sugar beet growers would be covered by the same provision. Soybean and sunflower farmers would be eligible for assistance if they suffered losses above 45 percent. Most crops not covered by government commodity programs, everything from peaches and cherries to dry edible beans and potatoes, must suffer losses exceeding 50 percent and would then receive payments covering 50 percent of the producer's lost income. The same 50-50 formula would apply to farmers who are not enrolled in federal commodity programs but grow wheat, corn, grain sorghum and other so-called program crops. Under the Democratic package, farmers with crops enrolled in government commodity programs would qualify for assistance if they suffered 40 percent losses. Farmers of other crops would have to show a 45 percent loss. The measure provided 65 percent payments for both. A $ 1 billion disaster relief bill passed by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> last month would require a minimum loss of 35 percent for any crop to receive assistance.

 A top military adviser to Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> says the B-2 stealth bomber wo n't give the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> an edge over the Soviets. `` For every action in life there is a reaction,'' Soviet Marshal <PERSON> Sergei </PERSON> <PERSON> Akhromeyev </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> on Friday. `` So if the creation, development and deployment of the B-2 is an action, in one way or another there will be some sort of reaction from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>.''

<HEAD>Holy Censorship! Film Board Bans Children Under 12 From Seeing Batman</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 `` Batman'' is winging its way to <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, but youngsters under 12 will have to stick to comic books to catch the Caped Crusader. The national film board says the popular movie is unsuitable for little kids. The British <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Film </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Classification </ORGANIZATION> applied its new `` 12'' category to the movie that opens Aug. 11 in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, with <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Keaton </PERSON> playing the title role and <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Nicholson </PERSON> starring as his evil nemesis, the Joker. The category bars youngsters under 12 from a film no matter what parents decide. In the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, the comparable PG-13 is only an advisory guideline for parents, while the R rating restricts minors from seeing a particular movie. A spokesman for filmmaker <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION> said the British decision was `` quite in keeping with the nature of the film. It is for the producers to decide what kind of film they wish to make and what they have come up with is not like the old comic strip television series from the'60s. This <PERSON> Batman </PERSON> comes out at night.'' A film board spokesman, speaking on condition of anonymity in keeping with British practice, said the new designation was created because the old `` 15'' classification wound up keeping children between the ages of 12 and 14 out of movies that may be suitable for them. Early Times, a children's newspaper, said: `` We are concerned that many children under 12, in the light of the hype and publicity over <PERSON> Batman </PERSON>, will be bitterly disappointed over the rating of this film as 12 Certificate particularly as the impression has been created that it is a summer family film.''

<HEAD>Judge Says Wildlife Case Strong, Orders Administration to Explain</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration has four days to explain why it suspended rules designed to protect endangered species of sea turtles after protests by shrimp fishermen in <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Court Judge <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Hogan </PERSON> on Friday refused to grant an order sought by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> to require the government immediately to enforce the suspended regulations for Gulf Coast shrimp fishermen. But <PERSON> Hogan </PERSON> called the federation's case `` a strong one'' and said the government has until Tuesday to detail under what legal authority Secretary of Commerce <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Mosbacher </PERSON> suspended the regulations. <PERSON> Hogan </PERSON> scheduled another hearing for Thursday. <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> lawyer <PERSON> Michelle </PERSON> <PERSON> Kuruc </PERSON> said at a hearing that the basis for <PERSON> Mosbacher </PERSON>'s action was that public safety was endangered by the protests. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Irvin </PERSON>, a wildlife federation lawyer, said he was disappointed that the judge had denied the order, but was encouraged by his comments that the wildlife group had a strong case. The rules suspended Monday would have required the use of devices that keep sea turtles from becoming entangled in trawlers' nets Instead, <PERSON> Mosbacher </PERSON> said shrimpers in 45 days would have to obey still another set of rules requiring them to lift their nets every 90 minutes or sooner so turtles can escape. Turtles can live that long if trapped, according to members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> supporting the shrimpers. Before the court hearing, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Audubon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> and the Defenders of Wildlife called for a nationwide boycott of shrimp to protest the fishermen's tactics. The suit, filed Tuesday, said <PERSON> Mosbacher </PERSON> was inflicting irreparable harm on five species of sea turtles that are listed as threatened or endangered. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fisheries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> estimates that 11,000 turtles die each year in shrimpers' nets. Last weekend, angry shrimpers used their boats to block ship channels along the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> coasts. Gunfire was reported in both states and four shrimpers were arrested in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. Two recreational boaters were hospitalized briefly for minor injuries after trying to run the blockade Saturday in <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Airline Smoking Ban Permanent Under Committee-Passed Bill</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BRISCOE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A ban on smoking aboard airline flights of two hours or less would become permanent under a bill sent to the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> floor, but anti-smoking forces say they expect tougher restrictions in the final bill. Tobacco industry lobbyists ended up pushing for the permanent ban Friday after a 25-25 vote on a ban that would have covered all domestic flights indicated growing congressional support for proposals to broaden the airline smoking ban. The tie vote defeated the wider ban, but it was the closest a congressional vote has come to outlawing all smoking on airliners. The bill, passed on a voice vote by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Works </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, is one of several proposals to extend or expand the 1987 temporary smoking ban on flights of two hours or less. That ban expires in April. Opponents made tongue-in-cheek suggestions that liquor, cheap cologne and crying babies could also be banned because they offend some people. Rep. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Clinger </PERSON>, R-Pa., who supported the permanent ban but opposed all proposals that would affect flights over two hours, joked that the committee might vote to `` install cheap cologne detectors and put crying babies in the hold. Rep. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Oberstar </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Minn </LOCATION>., who pushed for a total smoking ban, said the committee's defeat of attempts to apply the ban to longer flights reflects strong lobbying by the tobacco industry <PERSON> Oberstar </PERSON> said a more far-reaching ban would likely pass the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> but he declined to predict what the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> might do. One of the measures to extend the smoking ban is in the form of an amendment to an appropriations bill. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> is expected to take that up next week. <PERSON> Oberstar </PERSON> described Friday's vote as a `` short-term gain'' for the tobacco industry, which at first opposed making the two-hour ban permanent. However, several tobacco lobbyists switched strategies as the committee was voting. In the end, pro-smoking forces supported a permanent ban while anti-smoking committee members voted for a four-year extension of the temporary ban in the hope of ensuring that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> again would have to consider a total ban. Anti-smoking groups have said they will continue to fight against smoking on any airliner. `` The two-hour ban is far from a perfect piece of legislation and very far from the solution needed to protect all airline passengers and all flight crews from the serious hazards created by tobacco smoke in the airline cabin,'' said <PERSON> Ahron </PERSON> <PERSON> Leichtman </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Citizens </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Against </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tobacco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Smoke </ORGANIZATION>. Rep. <PERSON> Gus </PERSON> <PERSON> Savage </PERSON>, D-Ill., who said his wife of 34 years died from cancer, called in-flight smoking a life-and-death issue `` On an airplane, you ca n't open the window when someone else smokes. In midair, you ca n't transfer planes,'' <PERSON> Savage </PERSON> said. `` Rights are for now, but death is forever.''

 The kidnapping of a Shiite Moslem cleric by <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> commandos could put pressure on pro-Iranian terrorists to free some of the foreign hostages held in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, according to <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> officials. `` Clearly when you capture one of their top leaders it can deter terrorism and you have a certain amount of leverage in your hands,'' Army spokesman Col. <PERSON> Raanan </PERSON> <PERSON> Gissin </PERSON> said of Friday's raid by helicopter-borne commandos. Seized by the commandos were cleric <PERSON> Sheik </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdul </PERSON> <PERSON> Karim </PERSON> <PERSON> Obeid </PERSON>, his cousin <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON> <PERSON> Obeid </PERSON> and a friend, <PERSON> Majid </PERSON> <PERSON> Fahs </PERSON>, a Lebanese police spokesman told reporters. <PERSON> Gissin </PERSON> said <PERSON> Obeid </PERSON> and two `` assistants'' were `` safely in Israeli hands and undergoing questioning.'' One person was killed in the assault on an apartment building in the village of <LOCATION> Jibchit </LOCATION>, 20 miles north of the <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> border and 35 miles south of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, according to <LOCATION> Lebanese </LOCATION> and Israeli reports. Lebanese police said a neighbor, <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Zeid </PERSON>, opened the door of his apartment during the raid and was shot to death by the commandos. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio said <PERSON> Zeid </PERSON> was one of <PERSON> Obeid </PERSON>'s bodyguards. Even before Friday's abductions, some <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> officials said the capture of a Lebanese Shiite leader supported by <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> could influence the release of three <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> servicemen kidnapped in southern <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> in 1986. Lebanese security sources suggested <PERSON> Obeid </PERSON> may have been abducted in a plan to exchange him for <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> Lt. Col. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> or other foreign hostages. The sources also have linked <PERSON> Obeid </PERSON> with <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>' abduction. <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Danville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>, was kidnapped in southern <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> Feb. 17, 1988, while serving with an observer group attached to the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> peacekeeping force in southern <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. Seventeen foreign hostages are held in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, including nine Americans and three Britons but not counting the Israeli servicemen. It is belived most of the hostages are captives of pro-Iranian terrorist groups affiliated with <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>, or Party of God. <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, chief <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> correspondent of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, has been held the longest. He was kidnapped March 16, 1985, and a Shiite Moslem group, Islamic Holy War, has said it is holding him. <PERSON> Gissin </PERSON> called <PERSON> Obeid </PERSON> the `` equivalent of the commander of the -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- terrorist organization in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Obeid </PERSON>, 33, has denied involvment with the fundamenalist Islamic group but <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> have called him a member of <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> deplored the kidnapping, saying it could jeopardize the lives of the foreign hostages and called for his release. <PERSON> Gissin </PERSON> disagreed and said <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> leaders will `` now think twice before harming their hostages.'' `` They value the lives of their leaders far more then they value the lives of their suicide fighters,'' he added. <PERSON> Gissen </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> guerrillas have attempted at least 20 cross-border raids into <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> this year. An <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman told reporters, `` <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> said many times in the past that when the fight against terrorism is at stake, it reserves the right to respond whenever it finds it suitable and effective.'' The three Israeli troopers believed held hostage in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> are soldiers <LOCATION> Rahamim </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Alsheikh </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Yossi </PERSON> <PERSON> Fink </PERSON>, captured Feb. 17, 1986, when guerrillas ambushed their patrol, and air force navigator <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Arad </PERSON> seized Oct. 16, 1986, when his plane was shot down. Lebanese police, the Israeli news media and witnesses gave these accounts of the Jibchit raid: Three helicopters took part in the operation. About 12 commandos with silencer-equipped pistols surrounded <PERSON> Obeid </PERSON>'s building and forced their way into his apartment. Israeli television said the troopers blasted the front door of <PERSON> Obeid </PERSON>'s apartment with plastic explosives, seized <PERSON> Obeid </PERSON> and the other men and rushed them to a helicopter that departed in the attack that lasted less then 30 minutes. <PERSON> Obeid </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Mona </PERSON>, was locked in a room with her hands tied and her mouth taped shut. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> issued a statment saying, `` This shameless act by the Zionist regime will not remain unanswered by the Moslem and combatant forces.''

 More than half of all Japanese suffer from stress caused by work or relationships, but men are more likely to drink and women more likely to shop to deal with it, a government survey said today. According to the <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Welfare </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>'s national survey, conducted June 1988 among Japanese over 12 years of age, almost 52 percent of 36,146 people said they feel stress in their daily lives. More than 70 percent answered they can handle stress, but 10 percent said they were overwhelmed, the ministry report said. While 49.2 percent of 17,692 men said they feel stress, 54.4 percent of 18,454 women said they do. The survey pointed out men and women try to release stress differently. While drinking, exercise, television and radio were major remedies for men, chatting, idle time and shopping were the top three remedies for women.

<HEAD>Daily Flag Raising Now by Invitation Only</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The daily raising of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s scarlet flag in Tiananmen Square used to draw a motley audience of dozens and cause small, brief traffic jams in the bicycle lane adjoining the square. All-night food vendors, street sweepers, pedicab drivers, drifters _ anyone who happened to be up _ would gather at the flagpole to watch three soldiers goose-step out of the imperial palace and march into the square to raise the flag. These days, however, watching the national flag go up requires an invitation or advance permission. The square has been closed to the general public since June 4, when the crackdown on the pro-democracy movement began and soldiers backed by tanks drove student protesters from the square, the symbolic center of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. Bicyclists now are forbidden to stop along its edge. Today, about a dozen foreign journalists and more than 80 children from the <ORGANIZATION> Wangfujing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elementary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> had permission to watch the flag raising. The students wore the red kerchiefs of the <ORGANIZATION> Young </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pioneers </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> children's organization, and their teacher said they were there to `` learn to love the country and love the army.'' The children marched silently onto the 100-acre square, led by a half-dozen young soldiers who barked commands at them: `` Forward. Right face. Sit.'' Except for the soldiers and city buses that lumbered by, the still-dark square was silent. At the far end, on the monument to revolutionary heroes that the students had turned into a protest command post, two soldiers stood guard while six comrades napped, wrapped up in bedrolls on the stone pavement. At 5:30 a.m., the square's lights blinked off and the children sat silently on the pavement. At 5:52 a.m., 12 minutes later than scheduled, three soldiers emerged from the palace gate bearing the flag. The ceremony has been modified since June 4 _ two other soldiers stood guard with submachine guns. Upon order, the children raised their right arms in salute as the flag went up. The few without neckerchiefs stood with arms at their sides, apparently not allowed the honor of saluting their flag. A few silent minutes, and it was over. The children sat back down for a brief lecture by a white-gloved soldier on the history of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s flag. `` It is the color of fresh blood,'' he told the students, reminding them of the bloody civil war that preceded the Communist rise to power. A quick march around the square, and the children were off to school. Officers roused the sleeping soldiers with shouts of `` Hey.'' Bedrolls under their arms, they stumbled off the monument. Before June 4, sunrise was the signal for dozens of pedestrians to stream onto the square to take their morning exercise and enjoy the freshest air of the day. Today, more than 50 army trucks, each bearing about 36 soldiers, pulled up in rows on one side of the vast expanse. `` They are here to see the -LRB- Mao Tse-tung -RRB- memorial hall and the Great Hall of the People and <LOCATION> Zhongnanhai </LOCATION>,'' the party headquarters, said an officer, who refused to identify the unit. `` It's a good chance for them to see these things they would not otherwise see.'' The memorial hall, where revolutionary leader <PERSON> Mao </PERSON>'s preserved body is exhibited, has been closed to the public since the building underwent repairs over the winter. When will it and the square reopen? `` I do n't know. I'm sure sooner or later,'' the officer said.

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> says he'll do his best to make sure that <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> lives up to its responsibility to clean the oil-soaked shores of <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>. `` If I had the feeling Exxon was going to pull back on an agreement or fail to fulfill an agreement they'd made with us, with the government, or with the state of <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, I would ... try my best to do something about it,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said at a news conference Friday. The president's remarks came hours after <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> executives told a congressional panel that the company will suspend cleanup operations for the winter by mid-September. However, company officials said they would agree to any `` reasonable'' continuation of the cleanup next spring. More than 700 miles of shoreline have been damaged as a result of the March spill of nearly 11 million gallons of crude oil from the tanker <PERSON> Exxon </PERSON> <PERSON> Valdez </PERSON> in the nation's worst oil spill. <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> Vice Adm. <PERSON> Clyde </PERSON> <PERSON> Lusk </PERSON> told the interior subcommittee on water, power and offshore energy resources that he expected that there would be `` disagreements on what should be done,'' with differences in opinion as to what constitutes a clean beach. `` What is clean?'' <PERSON> Lusk </PERSON> asked. `` I do n't know how we're going to make that decision.'' <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION>'s plans have been questioned since the disclosure earlier this week of an internal memorandum that said `` no commitment should be made'' on when to suspend or resume cleanup. <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> officials interpreted the July 19 memo as an indication <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> was preparing to pull out, even though the cleanup is far from completed. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, asked by reporters about the matter, said he expected <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> to live up to its commitment. The brouhaha prompted Friday's subcommittee hearing. The memo, written by the manager of <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION>'s cleanup operation in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, `` suggests <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> is putting together its plan for demobilization without <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> approval,'' said subcommittee Chairman <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, D-Calif. W.D <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> USA </LOCATION>, called the wording of the memo `` unfortunate. The company, he said, will withdraw its equipment and estimated 10,000 workers from the region beginning Sept. 15 because of potential safety problems with rough seas and weather. <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> will return `` in the spring of 1990 to reinspect the area, to assure that the job has been properly done, and if not, to put it right,'' <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> said. But when <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> pressed him about whether <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> will resume cleanup in the spring, <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> said he could n't give `` an unequivocal commitment.'' `` I think it would be naive to do that,'' he said. `` We will follow through on any reasonable request that is made'' by the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Lusk </PERSON> said federal and state officials, as well as scientists and <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> representatives, would participate in the inspection next spring. But the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> has no authority to require <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> to do additional cleaning at specific sites, he said. <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> executives said Friday that about 600 miles of contaminated shoreline had been treated, but <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>'s chief environmental official put the figure at about 190 miles saying that in many cases oil has seeped back into the rocks and pebbles. `` We can not imagine how <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> can conclude 600 miles have been treated,'' said <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Kelso </PERSON>, the commissioner of <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conservation </ORGANIZATION> `` If that statement were made in <LOCATION> Kodiak </LOCATION> or Homer the roof would rise. Maybe they're looking at a different gulf.''

 Eskimos from four nations, guarding a tradition of hunting and fur trading, criticized animal conservationists for threatening the culture of Arctic people. <PERSON> Rosemarie </PERSON> <PERSON> Kuptana </PERSON>, vice president of the <ORGANIZATION> Inuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circumpolar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION>, urged delegates to force environmentalists and animal conservationists `` to answer our arguments,'' the <LOCATION> Greenland </LOCATION> newspaper Information reported Friday. `` Our opponents are much weeker when it is we who set the agenda,'' Ms. <PERSON> Kuptana </PERSON>, a Canadian, told the 500 Inuit delegates at a conference's meeting in <LOCATION> Sisimuit </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Greenland </LOCATION>. It was the first time a Soviet delegation attended a general assembly of the conference, a non-governmental organization for Inuit from <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Greenland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. Anger is growing among Arctic natives toward conservationist groups such as <ORGANIZATION> Greenpeace </ORGANIZATION>, whose campaigns the Eskimos say have damaged hunting and the fur trade. `` It never ceases to amaze me how people can react so strongly against traditional hunting on the part of a little group of indigenous people _ people who during thousands of years of hunting never have threatened a single animal species _ while at the same time industrialized society has polluted the planet to such a degree that there is no way back,'' Ms. <PERSON> Kuptana </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Greenpeace </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Kirsten </PERSON> <PERSON> Sander </PERSON>, who attended the conference as an observer, admitted that the group's campaign against seal skins in recent years had done unintended harm to Inuit hunters. To counter future anti-harvesting campaigns, the conference unveiled a far-reaching Inuit conservation strategy. This policy, largely the initiative of conference members from <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Greenland </LOCATION>, embraces all aspects of environmental concern in the Arctic. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Jull </PERSON>, a former Inuit adviser to the <LOCATION> Canadian </LOCATION> government, said the document calls for detailed research on the environment and wildlife, including all species that Inuits depend on for food and clothing. He said the plan was partly `` an expression that the environment is our interest and not just for the benefit of companies down south somewhere.'' The conference also compiled a guide of policy principles on issues including nuclear power, education and self-government for use at the regional and local levels. `` What we're basically saying is that we live in the <LOCATION> Arctic </LOCATION> and we know what happens when you mess it up,'' <PERSON> Jull </PERSON> said. About 40,000 Inuit live in <LOCATION> Greenland </LOCATION>, 28,000 in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> and 11,000 in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>. The Soviet Inuit comprise a small part of the 150,000 natives of the Siberian north.

The agreement also calls for improvements in pension and disability-insurance plans and better medical and dental coverage. It contains several provisions for resolving worker-management disputes and a no-strike, no-lockout clause.

<TEXT>
 The fire-damaged <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> <PERSON> Laboratory </PERSON> is taking on a crash program to replenish the nation's supply of rare research mice and gambling that tax money will keep it in business. The world's leading producer of unusual laboratory mice is using all its resources on mouse production rather than rebuilding, its director said. The fire two months ago at the <ORGANIZATION> Jackson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratory </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Bar </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION> crippled much medical research. By not using its insurance money to construct a permanent facility, the laboratory is facing the possibility that it will go out of business in as little as a year. `` Our responsibility was to get research animals out as fast as possible and worry about the financial problems later,'' the laboratory's director, <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Paigen </PERSON>, said Friday. The loss of the laboratory's mouse production facilities `` is currently creating very serious problems for research scientists all over the world,'' said Dr. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wyngaarden </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institutes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION>, in a recent letter to the <ORGANIZATION> Jackson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratory </ORGANIZATION>. The laboratory is the world's leading center for the study of mouse genetics. The fire on May 10 destroyed the laboratory's mouse production facilities and killed 400,000 research mice. The laboratory was supplying 20 percent of the nation's laboratory mice, including many unusual strains unavailable elsewhere The mice `` are essential to research on arthritis, lupus, cancer, heart disease, AIDS, and some 4,000 hereditary diseases,'' said <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Wexler </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Hereditary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>, in a letter to the laboratory. <PERSON> Paigen </PERSON> said the laboratory's interim production facilities, to be housed in large trailers, could produce 24,000 mice a week by the fall. Before the fire, the laboratory was producing 40,000 mice a week. The <ORGANIZATION> Howard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hughes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Bethesda </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, sent the laboratory an unsolicited check for $ 750,000. The <ORGANIZATION> Arthur </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> K. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Watson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Charitable </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> gave the laboratory $ 400,000. <PERSON> Paigen </PERSON> estimated losses from the fire at $ 40 million and said insurance will reimburse about $ 15 million. The laboratory has asked <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> for $ 25 million. A bill is pending in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> that would give that amount to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institutes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> to help restore the nation's supply of research mice. <PERSON> Paigen </PERSON> is optimistic that much or all of that money, if approved by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, would be awarded to <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> <PERSON> Laboratory </PERSON>. Jackson Laboratory mice have been used for 60 years to demonstrate the effectiveness of bone marrow transplants in treating some kinds of cancer, to understand the genetics of heart disease, the causes of diabetes and the basis of many inherited disorders. The fire is delaying much of that research. For example, the <ORGANIZATION> Mayo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Clinic </ORGANIZATION> was set to begin testing a new arthritis drug with <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> Laboratory mice this summer. The research has been put on hold until the mice are again available, <PERSON> Paigen </PERSON> said. Mice are useful for research because they can be bred to develop diseases similar to many human diseases. The fire began when a flammable adhesive being used by workmen ignited, <PERSON> Paigen </PERSON> said. `` Everybody who works at the lab mobilized to get as many animals out as they could,'' he said. `` We actually saved a hundred thousand animals.'' No strains of mice were permanently lost. A few animals of each strain, or in some cases frozen embryos, were stored outside the production facility as a safety measure. The problem now is to increase the numbers of those mice.

Root specialized in that type of litigation. But the lawsuit claims he committed legal malpractice by lying about some things, failing to attend to details associated with getting a license, and keeping the investors from getting a cash settlement from another group that ultimately got the license. <ORGANIZATION> Belle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chasse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Limited </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partnership </ORGANIZATION>, the group represented by Root, and five other groups were trying to get the same license approval for the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> area, according to the suit. Root, of <LOCATION> Alexandria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, is recovering from the bullet wound and other injuries stemming from the crash of a small plane he was piloting July 13. He is at his parent's home in <LOCATION> Plymouth </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, about 50 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION>. His father, <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Root </PERSON>, contacted by telephone early Saturday about the suit, said, `` I'm not aware of it, and I would n't have any comment.'' The elder <PERSON> Root </PERSON> said his son was not available for comment. Root had set out on a business trip, flying from <LOCATION> Arlington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, to <LOCATION> Rocky </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, and later told air traffic controllers he was having trouble breathing. He put his plane on autopilot and military planes kept watch on him until his plane ran out of fuel and ditched near the <LOCATION> Bahamas </LOCATION>. Root says he was unconscious until his plane hit the water, but the military pilots said they saw his head move. He also insists he does not know how he received the gunshot wound to the abdomen, which was found after his rescue. The lawsuit claims that <PERSON> Root </PERSON> told his group's lead investor, <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Armstrong </PERSON> <PERSON> Clear </PERSON>, that the other competing groups would be willing to pay <PERSON> Belle </PERSON> <PERSON> Chasse </PERSON> a $ 125,000 settlement for dropping its license application. However, the suit alleges, <PERSON> Root </PERSON> subsequently told attorneys for the other groups that he had been having trouble locating his clients, and that Clear and <PERSON> Belle </PERSON> <PERSON> Chasse </PERSON> had decided to dismiss their application. The <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> filed an order of involuntary dismissal against the application and <PERSON> Root </PERSON> allowed it to go through without telling the <PERSON> Belle </PERSON> <PERSON> Chasse </PERSON> investors what he had done, the suit alleged. Attorney <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Waltzer </PERSON> said the group that eventually won the license paid settlements to all of the other groups except <PERSON> Belle </PERSON> <PERSON> Chasse </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> officials said last week that Root, who was paid about $ 50,000 by the <ORGANIZATION> Belle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chasse </ORGANIZATION> group, had been involved in many cases in which groups received settlements in exchange for dropping their applications.

 Over a cup of coffee or a piece of homemade pie at <PERSON> Lizzie </PERSON>'s Cafe, folks talk about the silvery pagoda that rises 82 feet out of the prairie. `` It's the closest thing to a tourist attraction we've got,'' said <PERSON> Lizzie </PERSON> <PERSON> Guthmiller </PERSON>, who runs the only cafe in this central <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> farming community of 125 residents. The structure is the brainchild of <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Luehr </PERSON>, who declared it finished a year ago after working on it about five years. `` I guess I call it finished because when there's nothing else to do you just have to call it done,'' said the 69-year-old repairman, who has lived in the area all his life. About 1,500 people, some from as far away as <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>, have toured <PERSON> Luehr </PERSON>'s tapering tower, 15 miles off Interstate 94 and 60 miles from <LOCATION> Bismarck </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Tey </PERSON> sign their names in a green spiral notebook that serves as a guest register. The idea came to him when he was trying to decide what to do with wood from a friend's razed grain elevator, <PERSON> Luehr </PERSON> said recently as he easily maneuvered his tall, lean frame up a stairway to the pagoda's eight floors. <PERSON> Luehr </PERSON> wanted to build something with the rotting wood, but he wanted to do it without scaffolding. A pagoda was the answer, he decided. Walkways encircle each of its levels, from the ground floor that measures 26 feet in diameter to the top floor with a 19-foot diameter. <PERSON> Luehr </PERSON> sketched his plan for the pagoda from encyclopedia pictures and then went to work on it, alone. `` I seem to work faster that way,'' he said. <PERSON> Luehr </PERSON> used aluminum press plates from two newspapers as siding and old irrigation pipes as walkway railings. The inside decor _ carpeting, drapes and wall ornaments _ came from junkyards and auctions. Some of the artwork _ including six pictures of a black sun rising and setting _ was done by <PERSON> Luehr </PERSON> himself. `` I did n't spend hardly any money,'' said <PERSON> Luehr </PERSON>. `` I did n't have any money to spend, not on this dumb pagoda anyway.'' <PERSON> Luehr </PERSON>'s talent for frugal construction has been with him all his life. He remembers that at age 7 he built a playhouse with leftover house shingles and in 1941 he put up a barn, half of which included used lumber. He also has crafted a pair of doll house-size castles, a geodesic dome and a huge workshop in which he operates a farm machinery repair service. `` He's always got to have something to do,'' said <PERSON> Luehr </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Elaine </PERSON>. Without the pagoda to work on last winter, `` he talked 14 to 16 hours a day.'' `` I've got so much time, so much energy,'' <PERSON> Luehr </PERSON> explained, a smile brightening his tanned, weathered face. And the pagoda wo n't be his last project, he said. `` I have n't figured out what to do next, that's all.''

 Typhoon <PERSON> Judy </PERSON> was downgraded to a tropical depression today after it had slammed into <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, leaving 11 people dead and thousands homeless from widespread flooding. The National Disaster Center said all the victims died in landslides or cave-ins in the southern port city of <LOCATION> Pusan </LOCATION> and surrounding areas, which were hardest hit. The media quoted higher casualty tolls from the typhoon. KBS state television reported 19 people killed or missing. Two fishing boats sank in rough seas and 10,000 acres of paddy fields were flooded, it said. The weather bureau downgraded Typhoon <PERSON> Judy </PERSON> to a tropical depression about dawn today and said it had lost its force and been replaced by an ordinary low pressure system with heavy rains. Typhoon <PERSON> Judy </PERSON> packed winds of up to 78 miles an hour as it hit the coast Friday, dumping up to 11.7 inches of rain in already flood-stricken southern areas. One elderly woman was killed when a wall of her home collapsed, and a fisherman was swept into the sea, news reports said. Survivors were wading through knee-deep water to salvage their belongings, the reports said. Typhoon <PERSON> Judy </PERSON> left 40,000 people homeless and the toll of dead and displaced is expected to rise as communications with remote areas are restored, the Disaster Center said. <PERSON> Judy </PERSON> is the third typhoon in two weeks in <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>, where storms and flooding have killed at least 2,500 people and left hundreds of thousands homeless since mid-June. The typhoon swept across <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> earlier Friday, killing three and leaving hundreds of thousands without electricity before heading for the <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> peninsula. In <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, it followed five days of torrential seasonal rains that already had left thousands homeless and dozens dead in southern areas. The combined toll from floods and rains this week was 85 killed and 47 missing, said the Disaster Center. Nationwide, about 112,000 people were homeless, it said. It estimated property damage at more than $ 231 million. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> based in <LOCATION> Osan </LOCATION>, 25 miles south of <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>, used helicopters and 20 paramedics to rescue stranded flood victims. A <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military spokesman said they picked up 77 flood victims Friday, using rubber boats to reach some stricken areas.

 When Sister <PERSON> Elaine </PERSON> <PERSON> Fischer </PERSON> received her calling from God, she never expected to serve him wearing a flame-retardant suit and lugging heavy water hoses. But her decision to become a firefighter was received enthusiastically by fellow nuns at the <ORGANIZATION> Mount </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Saint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Scholastica </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Convent </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Atchison </LOCATION>, 40 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. Sister <PERSON> Fischer </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Benedictine </ORGANIZATION> novice who is to take her temporary vows next summer, began working at the local fire department on Friday. `` The sisters are all very excited for me,'' she said in a telephone interview. `` They're excited that one of us is doing something to help the community.'' Her decision to become a nun two years ago was something of a surprise to her family, since it came after she had earned a biochemistry degree from <ORGANIZATION> Kansas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. By comparison, becoming a firefighter was a minor threshhold to cross, she said. `` My family is very supportive,'' she said. `` After I joined the convent, nothing would shock them.'' For Sister <PERSON> Fischer </PERSON>, 23, a certified emergency medical technician with a love for physical activity, the decision to battle earthly flames came naturally. `` I really wanted to be an EMT, but you ca n't do one without the other here and firefighting intrigues me,'' she said. Although `` this is probably the first situation we've had here like this,'' Fire Chief <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> McDermed </PERSON> said he did n't hesitate to hire Sister <PERSON> Fischer </PERSON>, who finished first among 15 applicants after passing a vigorous physical exam and written and oral examinations. The 27-member department already has female firefighters, and Sister <PERSON> Fischer </PERSON> finished the physical exam, which must be completed in 20 minutes and includes carrying hoses weighing 50 pounds up and down a five-floor training tower, in 14 minutes, `` which is really not a bad score,'' <PERSON> McDermed </PERSON> said. Sister <PERSON> Fischer </PERSON> insists on being called `` Elaine'' in the workplace and wants to be treated like any new trainee. So far, her prayers have been answered. `` I think they're very relaxed around me. It's been very comfortable. They do n't treat me as anything other than a new employee,'' she said. Firefighter <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Regan </PERSON> said at first he was n't quite sure how to act. `` I was a little hesitant of what was going to be expected of us as far as attitude, you know, your language ... just out of respect for her,'' he said. `` You know, when you just say something bad, you say ` Oh God, I did n't mean that.''' Word of the blaze-battling nun surprised residents of <LOCATION> Atchison </LOCATION>, population 11,436, <PERSON> Regan </PERSON> said, `` but she's strong and she's willing to work and she's fun to be with.'' Growing up on a farm southwest of <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> accustomed her to working with her hands, Sister <PERSON> Fischer </PERSON> said. At the convent, her hobbies include `` maintenance _ anything from gardening to painting and woodwork.'' `` She's spunky but in a quiet way,'' said Sister <PERSON> Angela </PERSON> <PERSON> Ostermann </PERSON>, director of formation at the convent. `` When she first told me about the job, I think I was a little surprised,'' Sister <PERSON> Ostermann </PERSON> said. `` But then as we talked about it, we felt it was a very good way of serving the local community.''

 A jury cleared former <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stokes </PERSON> of charges he shoplifted a $ 17.25 bag of dog food from a pet store. The eight-member jury deliberated on the petty theft charge for 2 -LCB- hours before returning the verdict Friday night in the suburban <LOCATION> Shaker </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Heights </LOCATION> court. The dismissal was received graciously by prosecutor K.J. <PERSON> Montgomery </PERSON>. <PERSON> Stokes </PERSON> is a municipal judge in <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION>. `` The jury has done their job,'' <PERSON> Montgomery </PERSON> said. `` I just hope the judge does n't have any problems from this incident.'' <PERSON> Stokes </PERSON> was mayor from 1967 to 1971 and then worked as a news reporter for <ORGANIZATION> WNBC-TV </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. He returned to <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION> in 1980 to become a labor lawyer and was elected to the municipal bench in 1983. <PERSON> Stokes </PERSON>, 62, testified that he twice entered the Pad & amp; Fin pet store June 2 through a rear door and asked two dog groomers about buying dog food for his rottweiler <PERSON> Max </PERSON>. Each time the groomers said the store's regular employees had not yet arrived for the day, <PERSON> Stokes </PERSON> said Friday. `` I said, ` The hell with it, I'll get a bag of dog food and come back and pay for it in the afternoon,''' he said. <PERSON> Stokes </PERSON> said he was in a hurry to drive to downtown <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION> for three morning appointments. He returned to the store five hours later intending to pay for the dog food, he said, but sensed hostility from two regular employees he had known from past trips to the store, and again left without paying, afraid that even the appearance of wrongdoing could ruin his career. Last December, a hardware store security guard stopped <PERSON> Stokes </PERSON> with a $ 2.39 screwdriver in his pocket. <PERSON> Stokes </PERSON> said he had forgotten to pay for it. The store did not pursue shoplifting charges. Three of <PERSON> Stokes </PERSON>' children and his brother, Democratic Rep. <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Stokes </PERSON>, were present for the verdict.

 A woman rescued her husband, daughter, and six grandchildren from her burning home, then broke a window to save a seventh who had not awakened, officials said. <PERSON> Dorothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Goodman </PERSON>, 55, said she saw a bright light when she went into her kitchen early Friday to get something to drink. `` I saw the whole couch in the den was on fire,'' she said.

<TEXT>
 Inmates at a state prison want a federal judge to let them fix up the 91-year-old building themselves and use it for treatment and training programs. The <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> State Prison was ordered closed by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> as a result of a lawsuit filed on behalf of all prisoners in the state. The 1982 order declared the state's prison system unconstitutional because of overcrowding and poor conditions `` We're not asking for justice,'' prisoner <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Proctor </PERSON> told Gov. <PERSON> Ned </PERSON> <PERSON> McWherter </PERSON> during a recent meeting on the renovation proposal. `` We're asking for mercy.'' Of the prison's 1,200 inmates, 506 signed a petition filed Friday with <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> to keep the prison open for vocational and educational programs and psychiatric, drug and alcohol treatment for long-term prisoners. The prisoners propose that the prison house 500 convicts who have served at least eight years on sentences of 35 years or more. The court orders require the prison to close as soon as enough new prisons open to provide room for its inmates. One prison is to open in September, another in January and three more by 1992. A month ago, <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> denied the state's petition to renovate part of the <LOCATION> Tennesee </LOCATION> State prison as a special facility for 500 sex offenders and mentally and physically disabled inmates. But the petitioning inmates said they hope to change <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>' mind `` By using an inmate workforce, labor, construction and renovation costs will be drastically reduced,'' they said in court papers. `` By bringing education, vocational training and industry into such an environment, an inmate can contribute to his own support.'' <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> has said any modification in previous orders must first be approved by <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> McManus </PERSON>, a special prison master he appointed to keep tabs on the state's progress in upgrading the prison system. <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> said in his order last month that he supports the position of <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> Bonnyman </PERSON>, a lawyer who has represented prisoners since 1975. <PERSON> Bonnyman </PERSON> also wants <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> State Prison closed. <PERSON> Bonnyman </PERSON> said Friday he would have no comment on the prisoners' request

 Three Cubans who survived almost a week at sea were rescued by a Soviet spy ship prowling off <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canaveral </LOCATION>, which turned them over to the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials, who had no recollection of any previous rescue by Soviet sailors of fleeing Cubans, were puzzling over why the ship had not turned over the men, found floating 26 miles off the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> coast, to <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> authorities. `` In the time I've been here in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, this is the first time,'' <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Diaz </PERSON> said Friday. `` I've had two tours of duty here, so this is something new for us.'' The men were badly sunburned, dehydrated and exhausted after a six-day, 125-mile voyage during which they lost a companion and at one point resorted to catching a bird with bare hands and eating it raw. They were taken to <LOCATION> Jackson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Memorial </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> and treated for dehydration and severe sunburn. A hospital spokesman said they were in stable condition Friday night. The Soviet ship, identified in the reference book <PERSON> Jane </PERSON>'s Fighting Ships as the 274-foot <LOCATION> Zaporozhye </LOCATION>, spotted the three clinging to an inner tube and rescued them Friday morning, the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> said The Soviet captain refused to allow a <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> party to board, and the Cubans were transferred by raft to a patrol boat for their trip to <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>. The refugees identified themselves as <PERSON> Arsenio </PERSON> <PERSON> Gomez </PERSON> <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON>, 46, his son <PERSON> Pedro </PERSON> <PERSON> Gomez </PERSON> <PERSON> Cruz </PERSON>, 17, and <PERSON> Arsenio </PERSON>'s brother <PERSON> Humberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Valentin </PERSON> <PERSON> Gomez </PERSON>, 48. <PERSON> Junior </PERSON> <PERSON> Arlais </PERSON> <PERSON> Gomez </PERSON>, 20, cousin and nephew to the others, was lost at sea. The men had secretly built a 12-foot wooden rowboat in <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>, which they loaded with supplies and tied to a tractor-trailer tire inner tube. The rowboat overturned Monday night in rough seas, spilling their provisions. The men clung to the inner tube. They caught some small fish by hand, <PERSON> Arsenio </PERSON> <PERSON> Gomez </PERSON> said. A seabird landed on his head at one point, he said. He managed to catch it and they ate it. The men lost track of time and were n't sure when <PERSON> Arlais </PERSON> became delirious and thought he saw the lights of <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>. He let go of the tube and drifted away, they said. Cuban refugees who make it to <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> usually are turned over to the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Immigration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Naturalization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> and released to relatives after questioning. The <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> has picked up 97 Cubans on rafts this year, 31 this month alone. The Soviet ship has been operating for several months off <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canaveral </LOCATION> on intelligence-collecting operations, said <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> Lt. Cmdr. <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Burnett </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> fleet spokesman in <LOCATION> Norfolk </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>.

 Anti-nuclear activists who halted the firing of a Trident 2 missile from a submarine said they wo n't block the rescheduled launch, but will continue their political battle against the weapon Four <ORGANIZATION> Greenpeace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> U.S.A. </ORGANIZATION> vessels forced postponement of the launch Friday when they sailed into an off-limits danger area in the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> 50 miles off <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canaveral </LOCATION> and ignored repeated warnings to leave. It was the first time in the 38-year history of <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canaveral </LOCATION> that such a protest had stopped a launching. <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Shellhorn </PERSON>, commander of one of the <ORGANIZATION> Greenpeace </ORGANIZATION> ships, said the activists would not be back at sea when the launch is rescheduled. `` We think we made our point, and we've been quite successful in focusing attention on <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s most expensive missile system and in delaying its operational date,'' <PERSON> Shellhorn </PERSON> said Friday. `` We do n't think we can match the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> test for test, so we will concentrate on eliminating the Trident 2 through the political process,'' he said. `` But we wo n't rule out returning to the range eventually.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> called off the Trident 2 test several hours after the <ORGANIZATION> Greenpeace </ORGANIZATION> vessels penetrated the safety zone. A statement said the launch was postponed `` because of intentional interference from foreign flag ships in a designated hazardous operational area ... Concern for safety of the interfering ships precluded the launch of the test missile.'' `` We're happy about it, of course,'' <ORGANIZATION> Greenpeace </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Shannon </PERSON> <PERSON> Fagan </PERSON> said. `` But we would be happier if the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> canceled the Trident 2 missile altogether.'' <PERSON> Fagan </PERSON> said two large <ORGANIZATION> Greenpeace </ORGANIZATION> ships and two motorized rafts shadowed the submarine for hours, exercising their right to operate in international waters. Safety regulations require that a countdown be stopped if non-essential boats approach within about three miles of the submarine. One of the motorized rafts slipped up to the submerged <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> and the three-man crew attached three `` nuclear free seas'' banners to the submarine, two to the radio mast and one on the side, <PERSON> Fagan </PERSON> said. She said a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> whale boat dispatched from a cruiser twice rammed one of the <ORGANIZATION> Greenpeace </ORGANIZATION> boats, the 60-foot ketch Monticivitano, after warning it and the other intruding vessels that they were in danger because a missile launch was imminent. The damage was minor, she said. The M.V. <ORGANIZATION> Greenpeace </ORGANIZATION>, a 190-foot vessel, flew the Dutch flag. The Monticivitano sails under Swedish registry. The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> had no comment on the <ORGANIZATION> Greenpeace </ORGANIZATION> reports. It was to have been the second underwater test firing of the Trident 2, the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s newest, most powerful weapon. The first test, on March 21, ended in an explosion when the $ 23.7 million missile pinwheeled out of control four seconds after it was launched from the <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>. Nineteen land launch pad tests, 15 of them successful, preceded the sea trials. The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> has said it plans to have the Trident 2 operational and on station next March. The weapon has a range of 4,600 miles and can carry up to 10 nuclear warheads. Twenty-four missiles are carried on each sub.

Business travelers `` know they've got to get wherever they've got to get on the best schedule,'' but those who fly less frequently are questioning the type of aircraft they'll be on, she said `` As long as the fare's about the same, they are changing,'' she said. Still, most passengers are deciding to stay with a DC-10 flight after talking it over, agents said. `` You just have to have faith and just say, ` You know what, I ca n't afford to get hung up on this,'' said <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Dorman </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Hickory-Cal-Mart </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Travel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Irvine </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION> `` They're expressing concern but the most important thing to them is convenience,'' said agent <PERSON> Deb </PERSON> <PERSON> McNulty </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Salem </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, who said Friday she had a flurry of calls about DC-10s this week. Some passengers who saw diagrams of where <LOCATION> Sioux </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> survivors were sitting in the plane are asking for specific seats, she said. `` I had a man yesterday decline a reservation on a flight because he could n't get a seat over the wing,'' <PERSON> Green </PERSON> said. A <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> DC-10 crashed in <LOCATION> Sioux </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, on July 19, killing 111, and a Korean Air DC-10 crashed Thursday in the fog at <LOCATION> Tripoli </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>, killing at least 71 passengers. Initial investigation of the <LOCATION> Sioux </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> crash indicated a tail engine blew apart and cut off the flow of hydraulic fluid needed to control the jet. Friday, a <ORGANIZATION> Canadian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> DC-10 with 254 people aboard lost a wing wheel but landed safely at <ORGANIZATION> Pearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airport </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION>. `` Some people take it really serious,'' said <PERSON> Yolanda </PERSON> <PERSON> Zalitis </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Garber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Travel </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, who reported at least two people had asked for different planes because of nervousness. `` What people are doing is inquiring about it,'' said <PERSON> Elaine </PERSON> <PERSON> Tynus </PERSON>, owner of <ORGANIZATION> Lakeshore </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Travel </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. `` Some of my own personal clients I've called and asked them if they want to change. Some people have no desire to,'' she said. Crashes may give some passengers jitters, but there's no real reason for fear, said Capt. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Petee </PERSON>, a former pilot and a director of <ORGANIZATION> USAir </ORGANIZATION>'s Fearful Flyers Program. An average 18,000 commercial flights carry more than 1 million people daily in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and safety records are improving, not slipping, he said. `` When you get right down to it, any airplane that's certificated by the government, by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, is a safe plane to fly on It really is,'' said <PERSON> Petee </PERSON>. The <LOCATION> Sioux </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> crash was a `` one in 2 billion chance that something that catastrophic would happen,'' said <PERSON> Petee </PERSON>, whose airline does not fly DC-10s. Agencies that handle primarily corporate bookings reported far fewer calls of concern. And some agencies reported no increase in calls about airline equipment or declined comment, citing company policy against commenting on crashes.

 Gunmen ambushed a group of American visitors touring a Kenyan game park, killing a <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> woman, wounding a man and robbing the group of money and jewelry, a source said. The attack was the fifth on tourists in Kenyan game parks in less than a year. The group of 19 Americans was attacked Thursday as they drove in three vans along a 40-mile road between <LOCATION> Amboseli </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Tsavo </LOCATION> national parks in southern <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION>. `` They just jumped out in the road and fired on us,'' <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>, 66, was quoted as saying in a telephone interview with <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Hartford </LOCATION> Courant newspaper. <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>, a retired high school teacher from <LOCATION> Trumbull </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, was shot in the chest but the newspaper quoted him as saying he was not badly hurt. He spoke from his hotel in <LOCATION> Nairobi </LOCATION>. A woman was shot through the head and killed instantly. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Frances </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> identified her as <PERSON> Marie </PERSON> <PERSON> Esther </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferraro </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Haven </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn </LOCATION>. Her age was not available. <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> was quoted as saying that two men, one dressed in camouflage clothing, jumped out of the <PERSON> bush </PERSON> about midday and began firing at their convoy of three vans. The gunmen stole money and jewelry from them, he said. Sources said the gunmen used Soviet-made AK-47 assault rifles. They were on a trip organized by the <ORGANIZATION> Connecticut </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Audubon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> and had 18 people from <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> and one from <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, society spokeswoman <PERSON> Lauren </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Fairfield </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>. Kenyan Police Commissioner <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Kilonzo </PERSON> and <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Leakey </PERSON>, director of wildlife, went to the scene to investigate It was the fifth attack in 11 months on tourists in Kenyan game parks. They began in September when a Dutch tourist was shot in the chest in Meru National Park. Also in September, the remains of a <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> woman were found in sprawling <PERSON> Masai </PERSON> <PERSON> Mara </PERSON> Game Reserve in southwestern <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION>. An inquest begins Aug. 7 into her death, which her father says was murder. Police say she could have fallen prey to wild animals. In the first week of July, poachers shot two <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> tourists to death in <LOCATION> Meru </LOCATION> <LOCATION> National </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>, east of <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Leakey </PERSON> had called it an isolated incident. He said he did not think the poachers were `` looking for tourists to shoot.'' In April, three West German tourists were wounded by gunmen who ambushed their vehicles in about the same spot between <LOCATION> Tsavo </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Amboseli </LOCATION>. Two Americans remain hospitalized after being beaten up last week while on a horseback riding safari in <PERSON> Masai </PERSON> <PERSON> Mara </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> refused to release details about them. Maintaining security in <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION>'s parks is vital to this East African nation, which has hosted nearly 3 million tourists since 1984. Tourism last year brought in nearly $ 350 million and became <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION>'s top foreign exchange earner after coffee. After the French couple was killed, the government said it increased security to ensure national parks and game reserves are `` peaceful and comfortable havens'' and make sure the wildlife survive. <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION> has suffered increasingly from well-armed poachers who stalk and kill elephants for their valuable ivory tusks, primarily in <LOCATION> Tsavo </LOCATION>. Since <PERSON> Leakey </PERSON> became wildlife director in March, <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION> has stepped up anti-poaching efforts. Since January, game rangers have killed more than 20 poachers.

 <PERSON> Donna </PERSON> <PERSON> McGrady </PERSON> says she prayed along with fellow flight attendants as <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> Flight 232 headed for a fiery crash near an <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> cornfield, then gave thanks as survivors emerged from the wreckage. `` We all prayed _ we had our various moments of prayer,'' Ms. <PERSON> McGrady </PERSON> recalled Friday. Ms. <PERSON> McGrady </PERSON> broke down in tears Friday at a news conference where five <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> flight attendants who survived the crash joined three others who helped on the ground. The news conference, at <LOCATION> O'Hare </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>, was sponsored by their union, the Association of Flight Attendants. Seven of the eight working attendants aboard the DC-10 were among the 185 survivors. Flight attendant <PERSON> Rene </PERSON> <PERSON> LeBeau </PERSON>, 23, of <LOCATION> Schaumburg </LOCATION>, was one of the 111 who died in the July 19 crash near <LOCATION> Sioux </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>. The three-man cockpit crew survived, as well as a non-working pilot who helped out. When the tail section where she was seated came to rest, Ms. <PERSON> McGrady </PERSON> said she and another flight attendant helped people out of the wreckage and then realized the severity of the crash. `` At that particular time, to come out and to look and to see nothing but debris ...'' she said, her voice breaking. `` I said, ` Oh, God, where is the other part of the aircraft?''' But the sorrow was tempered by joy at seeing so many survivors, Ms. <PERSON> McGrady </PERSON> said. `` I said, ` Thank you, <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON>, for the things that you've done for us because we know there's no other way we could have made it without your presence,''' she said. `` It was so good to see them,'' said flight attendant <PERSON> Becky </PERSON> <PERSON> Larson </PERSON>, who were not aboard the plane but had helped survivors at the crash scene. `` We just hugged them and loved them and kissed them and we were so happy to see them,'' Ms. <PERSON> Larson </PERSON> said. Many of the dozens of <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> employees who attended dabbed at tears during the news conference. <PERSON> Janice </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, head flight attendant on the ill-fated DC-10, said she can not think of anything the flight attendants could have done to save more people, and could not explain how some survived while others did not. `` I'm not going to second-guess God,'' Ms. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said. Flight attendant <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Owens </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION>, who was seated in the middle of the plane, said `` the tail section of the plane just split apart and I saw a big beam of sunlight just coming through the big opening in the back.'' The flight attendants did not know at first that Ms. <PERSON> LeBeau </PERSON> had been killed, Ms. <PERSON> McGrady </PERSON> said. After the news conference, Chicago-based <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> held a private memorial service in the same room for Ms. <PERSON> LeBeau </PERSON> and four non-working <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> employees who died in the crash. An airline spokesman said more than 380 people attended. One flight attendant who was part of the plane's crew and a non-working attendant who assisted during the crash were still hospitalized Friday. The hospitalized flight attendant, <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Gillaspie </PERSON>, said Friday from the <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> hospital where she is being treated for fractured vertebrae that she wants to fly again. Mrs. <PERSON> Gillaspie </PERSON> said she will wait for physicians to say when she can return to the skies. `` When I get the first OK, I'm going,'' she said.

<HEAD>Zimbabwe Leader Says Peace Talks With Mozambique Rebels On Track</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Mugabe </PERSON> says he will consult with President <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> arap </PERSON> <PERSON> Moi </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION> in the next few days to prepare the way for peace talks between warring sides in <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION>. The African leaders are negotiating to end a 12-year war that has cost hundreds of thousands of lives and made half of <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION>'s 14.7 million people wholly or partly dependent on food aid. <PERSON> Mugabe </PERSON> said he expects to contact <PERSON> Moi </PERSON> `` in the next few days'' to arrange preliminary talks with officials of the rebel <ORGANIZATION> Mozambique </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resistance </ORGANIZATION>, also known by the Portuguese acronym <ORGANIZATION> RENAMO </ORGANIZATION>. The peace initiative, headed by <PERSON> Moi </PERSON>, aims at bringing the guerrillas to a conference table with representatives of President <PERSON> Joaquim </PERSON> <PERSON> Chissano </PERSON>'s Marxist-oriented government, <PERSON> Mugabe </PERSON> said. `` We are looking forward to cooperation by <ORGANIZATION> RENAMO </ORGANIZATION>, as much cooperation as possible,'' he told reporters Friday, a day after his return from an Organization of African Unity summit in <LOCATION> Addis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ababa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION>. `` We hope eventually there will be direct contact between the <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION> government and <ORGANIZATION> Renamo </ORGANIZATION>. It is these two parties that must negotiate a settlement to their problems,'' he said. Mozambican rebels have been fighting for 12 years to oust the <LOCATION> Maputo </LOCATION> government and are accused of widespread atrocities. They are considered right-wing because they used to be armed by <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, but their political goals are unclear. <PERSON> Mugabe </PERSON> said <PERSON> Chissano </PERSON> asked him on July 10 to join <PERSON> Moi </PERSON> as a mediator to end the fighting that, coupled with mismanagement and a weak infrastructure inherited from <LOCATION> Portuguese </LOCATION> colonizers, has placed <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION> among the world's poorest nations. <PERSON> Mugabe </PERSON> met with <PERSON> Moi </PERSON> at the African summit and the two agreed to `` draft parameters on the way we hope to operate'' and compare notes soon afterward, <PERSON> Mugabe </PERSON> said. He said a meeting with Mozambican rebel officials will follow, but gave no details. Landlocked <LOCATION> Zimbabwe </LOCATION> has 12,000 troops fighting alongside Mozambican government forces and guarding transport links and an oil pipeline through <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION> to the <LOCATION> Indian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION>. The proposed rapprochement follows a U.S.-brokered peace accord for southern African involving independence for <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> and the withdrawal of South African and Cuban troops in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>. Until the June 22 cease-fire between <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>'s government and <PERSON> Jonas </PERSON> <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON>'s U.S.-backed rebels, <LOCATION> Zimbabwe </LOCATION> opposed similar negotiations in <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION>. At first, the Mozambican rebels rejected <PERSON> Mugabe </PERSON> as too partisan to mediate. But earlier this month they accepted his role in the peace initiative. <PERSON> Chissano </PERSON>'s government is debating negotiations with the rebels at the annual congress of its ruling Front for the <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mozambique </ORGANIZATION>, the country's sole legal political party. The congress Friday presented a new policy document that drops all references to Marxism, Leninism and Western imperialism. But it says the party remains committed to socialism. The alterations coincide with a new government drive to end central control of the economy and reflects <PERSON> Maptuo </PERSON>'s improving relations with Western countries such as the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>.

 The `` Goddess of Democracy'' will stand again in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Tiananmen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION>, pledged Chinese dissidents attending the first <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chinese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Students </ORGANIZATION> in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` Some say <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> has no hope for democracy, but I say the hope is just beginning,'' <PERSON> Wu'er </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaixi </PERSON>, a leader of the pro-democracy movement in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, said Friday at the opening ceremony of the conference. `` I believe the Chinese can be united and will erect a Goddess of Democracy in Tiananmen Square one day,'' Wu'er told about 400 people at an auditorium at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. Delegates from 130 universities are attending the organization's founding conference, which will wind up Sunday Thousands of Chinese students who were studying abroad when the government crushed the student democracy movement in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> and other cities have decided not to return home. Wu'er, 21, who fled <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> after the military crackdown there in June, told the crowd to continue the battle for democracy. `` We ca n't rely on begging or wait for a next time,'' he said. `` We must try now!'' Behind him, a plaster replica of the <ORGANIZATION> Goddess </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democracy </ORGANIZATION> erected by Chinese protesters in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> overlooked the crowd, which cheered and stamped their feet as Wu'er shouted pro-democracy slogans. The original Goddess, fashioned after the Statue of Liberty, was torn down by the Chinese government after the military crushed the student democracy movement that had occupied Tiananmen Square. The students dismissed the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s announcement Friday that it was reining in corruption and nepotism. The party shut down two state-owned conglomerates, including one linked to senior leader <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaoping </PERSON>'s son, and ordered an end to many of the special privileges enjoyed by high officials. The Politburo order clearly was a response to the student movement, which struck a deep chord among hundreds of thousands of Chinese with its criticism of official corruption. `` Why are they doing it now? Because they have committed crimes, killed people demonstrating for basic human rights. Now they are trying to console people's anguish,'' said <PERSON> Jie </PERSON> <PERSON> Hu </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Northwestern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> student. `` They control everything, the economy, the daily lives of the people and what's in their minds,'' said <PERSON> Jie </PERSON>, who is from the Szechuan province in central <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. `` It's absolute corruption. There is no way they can cure this without reforming the system.'' Wu'er was one of six dissident leaders who attended the opening ceremony. All fled <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and later surfaced in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, where they have been trying to rally worldwide support for the pro-democracy movement in their homeland. Pro-democracy T-shirts were hung on the walls of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> building. Some shirts said `` You are not alone'' and bore one of the lasting images from the protest: the photograph of a man, standing alone, blocking a row of <ORGANIZATION> Chinese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> tanks.

 A sheriff played some mind games to rope in drug users headed for a country music fest in the north woods, and the trick paid off with 20 arrests. After posting a sign Friday that read `` Narcotics Inspection Ahead,'' six officers in camouflage hid by the roadside, positioning themselves so they could see the reaction of the people in passing vehicles on state Route 55. If the cars slowed down and those inside tried to conceal or discard something, the officers radioed ahead for patrolmen to pull them over, said <LOCATION> Langlade </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Sheriff <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Steger </PERSON>. Some open beer cans were tossed out windows, but no one threw drugs away, one officer told a reporter at the scene. `` They're too expensive,'' he said. Most of the arrests were for marijuana possession, and a few were for cocaine possession and posession with intent to deliver, he said. Officers accepted $ 100 bail in the form of personal checks, credit cards or cash. Soon after the operation began, promoters of the weekend country music festival at the <LOCATION> Mole </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Indian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Reservation </LOCATION>, about 220 miles north of <LOCATION> Milwaukee </LOCATION>, arrived at the arrest site a few miles south of the reservation to find out what was going on. `` It did n't take long for the word to spread,'' <PERSON> Steger </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Steger </PERSON> said accusations of entrapment did not worry him. `` There was good probable cause on all the stops we did make,'' he said.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> has stopped British Aerospace from negotiating a $ 500-million deal to sell Hawk trainer jets to <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, officials said. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s domestic <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> quoted unnamed government sources as saying <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aerospace </ORGANIZATION> had hoped to sell 500 of the jets to <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. A British Aerospace spokesman said Friday he could not comment on the price of any possible deal, saying `` it was n't a foregone conclusion we had an order. `` The MOD -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- vetoed us negotiating,'' he said. A ministry spokeswoman said the government was standing by its 1985 guidelines forbidding British sales of `` lethal equipment'' to either <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. Although the two nations' 8-year-old war was stopped by a U.N.-mediated cease-fire last year, negotiations so far have failed to produce a permanent peace treaty. `` It's not going ahead,'' the ministry spokeswoman said of the deal. She refused to elaborate. The British Aerospace Hawk trainer aircraft is used for flight and weapons training and can be modified for ground attack purposes, said the company.

 A reclusive and chronically ill boarder is suspected of killing his landlady and her daughter, then living for a week or more in the same house with their bodies before killing himself, police said. When police climbed through a window at the house Thursday night, a shot rang out from an upstairs bedroom. They found the body of a man who had just shot himself with a small caliber gun, police said Friday. Police searched the house and found the bodies of two females, both badly decomposed, in the basement. Autopsies performed Friday by the chief state medical examiner's office indicated that the women, <PERSON> Jarmila </PERSON> <PERSON> Petrzelka </PERSON>, believed to be in her early 70s, and her daughter, <PERSON> Jana </PERSON> <PERSON> Petrzelka </PERSON>, in her early 40, both died of gunshot wounds to the head. The man found upstairs, identified as <PERSON> William </PERSON> `` Red'' <PERSON> Hewitt </PERSON>, died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound, medical examiners said. Friends and neighbors described <PERSON> Hewitt </PERSON> as a reclusive, chronically ill boarder who had lived with the Petrzelkas for about four years but was no longer wanted in the house. When he moved in, friends said, he was dating the younger <PERSON> Petrzelka </PERSON>, a social worker, but the relationship had long since ended. `` Over the past couple of years, they had n't been very happy with him staying there, but they were not the kind of people who would turn somebody out,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, a friend of the family.

 The skunk that broke into <PERSON> Eva </PERSON> <PERSON> Busch </PERSON>'s house several nights last week had a thing for her TV set. While <PERSON> Eva </PERSON> slept, the skunk would nose through her towels, shoes and socks and gather them in front of the television. It could n't have been that much of a thrill to watch, she says, because the set was off `` For some reason or another he seemed to be interested in TV,'' she said. When she entered the bathroom Thursday morning, the skunk was in the tub, and she called the police. Officer <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> filled the tub with water, then scooped the skunk up in a box and took him outside. `` Floating around in the tub, it could n't spray me,'' <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> said. Ms. <PERSON> Busch </PERSON> figures the animal entered through a back door left open because of warm weather.

 The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration is threatening to withhold <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid to <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> if the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> is given a dominant role in a new transitional government. But the policy paper distributed to reporters today as Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> arrived here for a 20-nation conference acknowledged that Prince <PERSON> Norodom </PERSON> <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON> might include the group whose leaders are accused of murdering more than a million Cambodians more than a decade ago. `` The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> would continue to support him,'' the paper said. It offered the same assurance if <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON> also gave a role to members of pro-Vietnam Prime Minister <PERSON> Hun </PERSON> <PERSON> Sen </PERSON>'s government. <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON> is recognized by all Cambodian factions as the logical head of an interim government to be formed after the withdrawal of Vietnamese troops in late September. The <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>, backed by <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, is one of three factions seeking to overthrow the government in <LOCATION> Pnom </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Penh </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, in an airborne news conference, said the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration would be willing to make `` a major effort at mobilizing the international community in support of a solution to the tragic problem of <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>.'' He said that would include exerting influence on international banks to help the country's rehabilitation after 10 years of civil war. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> also would be prepared to end its support to anti-communist forces in the event of a settlement. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> currently is supplying about $ 3 million to $ 5 million a year in non-lethal aid to the guerrillas. `` If we could achieve a cessation of external assistance, that would include external assistance from all sources, including any external assistance from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said. In the conference, which opens on Sunday, <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said his objectives included: _ An immediate cease-fire _ Formation of an interim government headed by <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON> _ Finding a formula to hold free elections _ Voluntary return of refugees _ A <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> supervisory force to monitor the Vietnamese withdrawal and elections The paper on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy stressed that `` our strong preference would be that there be no <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> participation.'' After pledging to support <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON> even if he gave a role to the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> or <PERSON> Hun </PERSON> <PERSON> Sen </PERSON>'s followers, the statement added: `` We have made it clear, however, that our ability to support any <LOCATION> Cambodian </LOCATION> government is directly and inversely related to the degree of <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> participation, if any, in it.'' The paper then went on to declare flatly: `` The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> can not accept any role whatsoever in any future Cambodian government for the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>'s leaders discredited before the world.'' Later today, <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> will meet for two hours with Soviet Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>, who is representing <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> at the conference. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said the two may begin planning a summit meeting between President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. But he said the real preparation will be undertaken when he meets with <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> in September. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> also said he may talk with Chinese Foreign Minister <PERSON> Qian </PERSON> <PERSON> Qichen </PERSON>, who will head <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>'s delegation. `` With respect to that issue I would say, ` Stay tuned,''' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said. There will be no formal meeting but <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> and <PERSON> Qian </PERSON> will be seated next to each other under an arrangement made by <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> barred high-level <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> visits to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> after the crackdown last month on students seeking political reforms. This is being interpreted by the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> as not prohibiting such meetings outside <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>.

 A Chinese army officer and his wife defected today to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> through the demilitarized zone separating the country from communist <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, the defense ministry said. Meanwhile, newspapers in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> reported today that a <ORGANIZATION> Chinese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> attache, protected by the Japanese government while she sought asylum, left to start a new life in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Ma </PERSON> <PERSON> Qiuyun </PERSON>, an attache in the embassy's visa section, went into hiding after the June 3-4 military crackdown on pro-democracy protesters in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> and sought help from the Japanese government June 14, <ORGANIZATION> Yomiuri </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shimbun </ORGANIZATION> newspaper said. It was not known immediately whether the defectors from <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> seek asylum for the same reason. A South Korean intelligence source, speaking on condition of anonymity, identified the officer as Maj. <PERSON> Zuo </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiukai </PERSON>, 40, a member of the <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> delegation to the <ORGANIZATION> Korean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Military </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armistice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> that oversees the 1953 Korean cease-fire. <PERSON> Zuo </PERSON> is the fourth-ranking officer in the <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> delegation led by a brigadier general, he said. <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman Brig. Gen. <PERSON> Yoon </PERSON> <PERSON> Chang-ro </PERSON> said the Chinese couple remain in protective custody of the American-led <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Command after walking across the border through <LOCATION> Panmunjom </LOCATION> truce village this morning. The senior official, from the government <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Unification </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, did not say whether the defectors seek asylum in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> or a third country such as <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> has no diplomatic relations with <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, but relations between the two recently have improved. The official, requesting anonymity, said the Chinese couple will be handed over to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> soon. The <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Command which polices <LOCATION> Panmunjom </LOCATION> consists of representatives of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and 15 other countries that helped <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> drive out invading North Koreans in the 1950-53 Korean War. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> fought with <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> and signed the 1953 cease-fire. Today's defection is the first known <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> defection through <LOCATION> Panmunjom </LOCATION>. North Koreans, Russians and Czechoslovakians have defected there. Newspapers in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> reported it took the Japanese government a month to to find a country to shelter Ms. <PERSON> Ma </PERSON>, 27. Finally, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> agreed and <ORGANIZATION> Lufthansa </ORGANIZATION> German airline confirmed she flew to <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> Friday afternoon. According to <ORGANIZATION> Mainichi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shimbun </ORGANIZATION> newspaper, Ms. <PERSON> Ma </PERSON>'s first preference was the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, but <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> refused, apparently to avoid worsening relations strained since the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> began protecting Chinese dissident <PERSON> Fang </PERSON> <PERSON> Lizhi </PERSON> and his wife, physics professor <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Shuxian </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> also turned down Ms. <PERSON> Ma </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shimbun </ORGANIZATION> said. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Embassy officials could not be reached for comment today and the newspaper account could not be verified. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration has offered protection to all Chinese citizens in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and at least two Chinese diplomats have obtained refuge in the country. In June, a <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said other <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> officials have asked <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> for protection, but he refused to elaborate. <PERSON> Fang </PERSON> and Ms. <PERSON> Li </PERSON> fled to the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> after Chinese troops marched on unarmed protesters in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> and killed hundreds, perhaps thousands. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> says only 100 civilians and nearly 100 soldiers and police died.

 The ailing <PERSON> Exxon </PERSON> <PERSON> Valdez </PERSON> limped toward safe harbor today, after postponing massive hull repairs for weeks while waiting offshore until environmental questions could be answered. The tanker involved in the nation's worst oil spill was scheduled to enter <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> early Sunday, under tow as it has been throughout the 2,500-mile journey south from <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>. Divers were confident they had cut off all the dangling steel plates torn loose during the southerly voyage and that the gutted tanker would be able to pass through the harbor's shallows. State environment officials said they would keep close watch on the lumbering ship when it enters the bay under escort, surrounded by a flotilla of <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> boats. Local <ORGANIZATION> Greenpeace </ORGANIZATION> activists said they'd be watching too, following at a distance after staging a protest demonstration against <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> planned for Sunday morning. `` We are concerned that it will be discharging into the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Rick </PERSON> <PERSON> Nadeau </PERSON>, director of <ORGANIZATION> Greenpeace </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION>. `` If it does have some oil slicks coming out of it, we'll be able to see that.'' <PERSON> Nadeau </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Greenpeace </ORGANIZATION> wants to see the Valdez reach the dock safely because more environmental damage could occur if the tanker remains at sea any longer. An 18-mile oil slick was spotted near the tanker July 10, and since then the <LOCATION> Valdez </LOCATION> has been halted about 55 miles off the coast of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION>. Numerous tests were conducted and the emergency plate-cutting work was undertaken. Exxon officials and state negotiators hammered out an agreement to allow <PERSON> Valdez </PERSON> into port. The Valdez, which spilled 11 million gallons of crude oil after slamming into a submerged reef in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, was to execute a series of maneuvers, simulating what it will have to do inside the harbor, before being allowed into the bay. <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> officials insist that periodict discharges from the Valdez are nontoxic with barely detectable traces of oil. State officials, leery of Exxon assurances, have said the ship is releasing significant pollutants.

<TEXT>
 Syrian and <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> forces kept up their relentless rocket attacks in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> today, killing eight people and wounding 42 in a wave of bloodshed that has driven out all but a fraction of the populace, police said. Fires blazed out of control and palls of thick, black smoke billowed from gaping holes that rockets and shells made in apartment buildings in both Moslem and Christian sectors. The new casualties raised the overall toll to 502 killed and 2,056 wounded in the 19-week confrontation between Christian forces and Syrian army gunners. A police spokesman, who can not be named under regulations, estimated that only about 250,000 people remain in the city that was home to an estimated 1.5 million residents when the current fighting broke out March 8. The spokesman said about 50 percent of the population fled in the first three months of the fighting and about 350,000 people have fled in the past 10 days. Most of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>'s residents have fled to south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, the eastern <LOCATION> Bekaa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> valley </LOCATION> and the mountain resorts northeast of the city to escape the deadly shelling duels, the spokesman said. Moslem and <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> radio stations interrupted regular programming early in the day to report that shelling duels were continuing across a mountain range southeast of the capital. `` The fight started very early today,'' the Moslem-run <ORGANIZATION> Voice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nation </ORGANIZATION> radio reported in a news flash. The Christian-controlled <ORGANIZATION> Voice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lebanon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION> urged civilians to `` take maximum precaution because the shelling might escalate and spread to other areas.'' The thuds of exploding shells echoed across the wooded hills south of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> early in the day as Syrian army gunners pounded the Christian suburb of <LOCATION> Baabda </LOCATION> east of the capital. <LOCATION> Baabda </LOCATION> houses the presidential palace that has been used as the main headquarters for <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> army commander Gen. <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> since the confrontation broke out. Several motorists, heading to <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> to inspect their deserted apartments and businesses, turned back to south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> and other safe areas to avoid being caught in the cross-fire. `` They're shelling his palace. He'll respond soon. I do n't want to be around when his response starts,'' said <PERSON> Marwan </PERSON> <PERSON> Shaar </PERSON>, a Sunni Moslem who owns a money exchange company. <PERSON> Shaar </PERSON> spoke in the Syrian-policed <LOCATION> Khaldeh </LOCATION> area, seven miles south of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. The area was under fierce shelling from <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s gunners overnight The escalating shelling duels coincided with reports in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s heated rumor mill that either <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> or the Syrians would have to storm their opponent's positions to break out of the 4-month shelling duel that has not altered either side's areas of influence. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>, in an interview with the weekly <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> An-Nahar </ORGANIZATION>, pledged that `` We shall be advancing against the occupied areas.'' He did not elaborate. The 54-year-old Maronite general had declared a `` war of liberation'' against <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>'s 40,000 troops deployed in predominantly Moslem sections of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> under a 1976 peacekeeping mandate from the <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION>. He made the move after the Syrians and allied forces besieged his 310-square-mile Christian enclave northeast of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> in retaliation for his blockade of ports run by Syrian-backed militias south of the capital.

<HEAD>Indian Troops To Start Withdrawal Today</HEAD>

 The government said thousands of Indian troops would begin leaving today, the second anniversary of an accord that brought them to <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION> to quell a rebellion but instead fueled more violence. <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> agreed on Friday to resume withdrawing its 45,000 peacekeeping troops, averting a showdown with <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Ranasinghe </PERSON> <PERSON> Premadasa </PERSON>, who had called the continued troop presence a threat to his country's independence. The government said 3,000 to 4,000 troops would begin leaving today. `` The <LOCATION> Indo-Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION> problem to a great extent has been resolved,'' Foreign Minister <PERSON> Ranjan </PERSON> <PERSON> Wijeratne </PERSON> said before he and a six-member delegation left for <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION> to discuss a timetable for the withdrawal of the rest of the Indian troops. `` <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s decision to recommence the withdrawal process has further consolidated the 2,500-year-old friendship between the two countries,'' he said. <PERSON> Premadasa </PERSON> originally sought the departure of all Indian troops by today, but <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> maintained an immediate withdrawal would worsen ethnic violence. <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s decision Friday came on one of the most violent days, when 74 people were killed. Casualties included nine Tamil guerrillas killed Friday in two separate clashes with Indian troops, according to military officials who can not be identified under briefing rules. State television said most victims were killed by Sri Lankan forces in the Sinhalese heartland, where extremists have violently protested government peace efforts and where Indian forces are not deployed. The military also announced at least 150 people have died since the government declared a nationwide curfew from midnight Thursday to 6 a.m. Sunday to prevent violence during the anniversary. The two-year <LOCATION> Indian </LOCATION> military presence has fueled ethnic violence among Tamil guerrillas the Indians were supposed to disarm and Sinhalese extremists who say the Indian presence violates Sri Lankan sovereignty. <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, spurred by its own politically powerful Tamil ethnic minority of 60 million, sent troops to <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION> to enforce a July 29, 1987, peace accord sponsored by <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> and designed to give ethnic Tamils some autonomy in northern and eastern <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>. But the biggest Tamil guerrilla group, the <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tigers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tamil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eelam </ORGANIZATION>, reneged and began attacking the Indians. Tamils, who make up 18 percent of <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>'s 16 million people, say they are discriminated against by the Sinhalese, who comprise 75 percent of the population and control the government and armed forces. Sinhalese extremists upset with the concessions made to Tamils, meanwhile, began attacking moderate Sinhalese who supported the peace overtures. Sinhalese radicals are accused of killing 4,000 people, mostly Sinhalese government officials and supporters, since Indian troops began arriving. Another 11,000 people, including 1,000 Indian soldiers, have died in the Tamil separatist war that started in 1983. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration said it hopes <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION>'s decision saves lives `` We welcome this development and hope that <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION> will be successful in reaching an agreement on a timetable for withdrawal that minimizes bloodshed while recognizing <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>'s sovereignty and independence,'' said <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON> It remained unclear when all of the Indian troops would leave. Foreign Minister <PERSON> Ranjan </PERSON> <PERSON> Wijeratne </PERSON> and six other Sri Lankan officials were to fly to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION> on Friday to discuss a timetable for the withdrawal of the rest of the Indian troops. <PERSON> Premadasa </PERSON> earlier said Sri Lankan troops would leave the barracks where they have been confined for two years and resume patrols in Tamil areas. At the peak of its involvement in <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s peacekeeping force numbered at least 70,000 The most recent withdrawals were in January and February when about 5,000 soldiers left shortly after <PERSON> Premadasa </PERSON> took office.

Local <ORGANIZATION> Greenpeace </ORGANIZATION> activists said they'd be watching too, following at a distance after staging a protest demonstration against <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> planned for Sunday morning. `` We are concerned that it will be discharging into the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Rick </PERSON> <PERSON> Nadeau </PERSON>, director of <ORGANIZATION> Greenpeace </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION>. `` If it does have some oil slicks coming out of it, we'll be able to see that.'' <PERSON> Nadeau </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Greenpeace </ORGANIZATION> wants to see the Valdez reach the dock safely because more environmental damage could occur if the tanker remains at sea any longer. An 18-mile oil slick was spotted near the tanker July 10, and since then the <LOCATION> Valdez </LOCATION> has been halted about 55 miles off the coast of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION>. Numerous tests were conducted and the emergency plate-cutting work was undertaken. Exxon officials and state negotiators hammered out an agreement to allow <PERSON> Valdez </PERSON> into port. The Valdez, which spilled 11 million gallons of crude oil after slamming into a submerged reef in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, was to execute a series of maneuvers, simulating what it will have to do inside the harbor, before being allowed into the bay. <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> officials insist that periodic discharges from the Valdez are nontoxic with barely detectable traces of oil. State officials, leery of Exxon assurances, have said the ship is releasing significant pollutants.

<HEAD>Soviet Opposition Faction Takes Form at Moscow Meeting</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 About 250 reform-minded lawmakers held a strategy meeting today for what promises to become the national parliament's first organized opposition in nearly 70 years The fledgling faction of Soviet legislators, operating under the bland title of the `` Inter-Regional Deputies' Group,'' is pushing for more radical economic reform and greater democracy. Progressive economist <PERSON> Gavriil </PERSON> <PERSON> Popov </PERSON> opened the group's first general meeting in the crowded auditorium of the <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Filmmakers </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> with a call to bring reform through careful legal changes instead of the government's `` spontaneous approach'' to crisis after crisis Speakers then began discussing amendments and projects they want to lobby for in the Supreme Soviet legislature. Organizers said many more than the 250 deputies who registered for the two-day general meeting wanted to come, but some could not obtain tickets and others were too involved in local events. All 2,250 deputies elected to this spring's <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> Deputies were eligible to join <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION>, which dubbed the group `` left-radicals,'' said today they have a place in the reform process but that some legislators `` have expressed the fear that in this complex time for the country, when unity of action is required, this ` left-radical group' might turn into some kind of opposition.'' In fact, some members say, the group already sees itself as an opposition faction but avoids saying so publicly. `` We're avoiding the words ` opposition' and ` faction' because they're perceived negatively,'' <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> deputy <PERSON> Yuri </PERSON> <PERSON> Andreyev </PERSON> said in an interview. `` But in actuality, this is a group of opposition deputies who want to work in an organized way at the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the Supreme Soviet.'' <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> deputy <PERSON> Sergei </PERSON> <PERSON> Stankevich </PERSON>, writing in the first issue of the group's newspaper, `` the People's Deputy,'' said that fears instilled by years of political tyranny made people shy away from the idea of open opposition. `` No sooner does someone pronounce the words ` faction' and ` opposition' from the rostrum than some people feel their hearts drop into their feet and their backs break out in sweat, and others get a hunter's spark in their eyes and a militant shout in their throats,'' he wrote. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> predicted that maverick Communist <PERSON> Boris </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> would be elected head of the <ORGANIZATION> Inter-Regional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>. Elections were to be held on Sunday. Thus far, the group has been tolerated but given no concrete support by the government apparatus and was denied its own meeting place in the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION>, organizers said. It is working on setting up its own staff and support base, said <PERSON> Elena </PERSON> <PERSON> Kotova </PERSON>, head of the two-week-old `` Foundation of Deputies' Initiatives. The foundation is searching for legal ways for voters to contribute money to their deputies and also hopes to act as a data bank and channel for voters' requests, <PERSON> Kotova </PERSON> said. `` Our desired aim is to have the equivalent of a Western party,'' she said. The last alternative party to survive the Bolshevik purges, the Left Socialist Revolutionaries, was suppressed in 1922. The <ORGANIZATION> Inter-Regional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> grew out of `` the despair of the radically-inclined minority'' during the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> when they found virtually all their motions blocked by what one deputy called the `` aggressively obedient majority,'' the newspaper <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> Deputy said. <PERSON> Popov </PERSON> proposed creation of an independent group of deputies on May 27, the third day of the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> lasted two weeks; it served as a national stage for striking revelations about the country's crises and launched commissions but produced little actual legislation. The <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> `` postponed the resolution of essential problems for an undefined period,'' the People's Deputy said, `` and that led to strikes and the sharpening of the inter-ethnic situation.'' Among questions discussed today were amendments that would give enterprises more independence from ministries and a resolution asking that Soviets living abroad who were stripped of their citizenship be allowed to reclaim it.

<DATELINE>BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> has dismantled nearly half of the barbed wire fence and alarm system that has divided this communist nation from the West for more than 30 years, an official said. <PERSON> Balazs </PERSON> <PERSON> Novaki </PERSON>, deputy commander in chief of the Hungarian frontier guards, told reporters on Friday that work on removing <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s `` iron curtain'' has progressed more swiftly than planned. Hungarian leaders presented President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> with a piece of the barbed wire fence when he visited <LOCATION> Budapest </LOCATION> earlier this month. Speaking at a news conference at the border town of <LOCATION> Koeszeg </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Novaki </PERSON> said the system now has been removed from a 75-mile section of <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s 160-mile border with neutral <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>, the official <ORGANIZATION> MTI </ORGANIZATION> news agency reported. During the spring, workers began cutting through the barbed wire at four stops along the border, and officials said then they expected to dismantle the barrier completely by Dec. 1, 1990. <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> decided in February to remove the fence and electronic alarm system that was installed in 1972. <PERSON> Novaki </PERSON> said restrictions in the 15-mile-wide border zone, such as on travel and movement, will be lifted Aug. 1 but that guards will continue to patrol the border. The number of Western tourists visiting <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> has increased considerably this year, <PERSON> Novaki </PERSON> said, with the biggest increases among visitors from <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Officials also have said there has been a substantial increase in the number of citizens from other <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc countries attempting to flee to the West over the Hungarian border since they began dismantling the fence. Most are from <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, officials have said.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Hearst </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> has put the <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Examiner </ORGANIZATION> up for sale, one of the newspaper's editors said. The announcement, which according to features editor <PERSON> Andrea </PERSON> <PERSON> Herman </PERSON> was made to employees on Friday, followed months of reports the owners were holding discussions with potential buyers of the money-losing paper. The reason was not publicly announced, but a statement to newspaper employees said the decision was a result of intense pressure from competitors of the afternoon paper. `` For a number of years, the <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Examiner </ORGANIZATION> has been in an extremely challenging situation,'' said the statement by <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Danzig </PERSON>, vice president and general manager of <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Newspapers </ORGANIZATION>. `` We have weighed these considerations carefully and have reached a conclusion that continuing our ownership of the <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Examiner </ORGANIZATION> is not compatible with the strategic direction of our newspaper company,'' <PERSON> Danzig </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> Hearst </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, a privately held company, has acknowledged the paper loses money, but wo n't disclose figures. In recent years the newspaper has lost readers to the rival <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> as well as to growing suburban newspapers. But with a circulation of 238,392 daily and 183,122 on Sunday, the <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Examiner </ORGANIZATION> still is the 42nd largest newspaper in the country, Ms. <PERSON> Herman </PERSON> said. Daily circulation peaked at 729,000 in 1967, when the <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Examiner </ORGANIZATION> was the nation's largest afternoon daily. The beginning of the circulation decline coincided with the start of a 10-year strike by the <ORGANIZATION> Newspaper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guild </ORGANIZATION>. Afternoon newspapers across the country have been hurt by the growth of suburbs because delivery is hampered by traffic. Still, the <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Examiner </ORGANIZATION> has earned a reputation as a scrappy newspaper that provides vigorous coverage of the nation's second-largest city The newspaper was the first to delve into the financial dealings of Mayor <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON>, and its queries into the five-term mayor's ties with a commercial bank prompted this week's <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> hearings into a controversial deposit of $ 2 million in city funds with the bank <ORGANIZATION> Hearst </ORGANIZATION> hired the investment banking firm of <ORGANIZATION> Lazard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Freres </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> to handle sale negotiations, according to the announcement given to newspaper employees.

 As thousands of people milled through a sun-splashed street fair, a mental patient who had walked away from a hosptial attacked a 9-year-old girl and stabbed her to death in front of her mother. <PERSON> Jessica </PERSON> <PERSON> Short </PERSON> was pronounced dead about a half hour after the 2:20 p.m. attack Friday, a hospital spokesman said. `` A young life was wasted and I want to know why,'' Mayor <PERSON> Sebastian </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Garafalo </PERSON> said at a news conference. `` I keep asking, ` Why?' It's so senseless.'' <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Peterson </PERSON>, 37, a patient at <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>, was charged with murder in what police Chief <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Aylward </PERSON> called a `` random act of violence.'' <PERSON> Peterson </PERSON> had been ordered confined at the hospital for 15 years in May 1988 after being found innocent by reason of insanity on assault and burglary charges, said <PERSON> Martha </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>, executive director of the state <ORGANIZATION> Psychiatric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Review </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, which oversees his confinement. <PERSON> Aylward </PERSON> said he had been told by the hospital that <PERSON> Peterson </PERSON> was free on an eight-hour pass Friday. Hospital Superintendent <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Cappello </PERSON>, however, denied that <PERSON> Peterson </PERSON> had been given a pass, and said he simply walked off the grounds without permission. `` <PERSON> Peterson </PERSON> had been granted privileges to go to the library and stay in the building,'' <PERSON> Cappello </PERSON> said. `` He went AWOL.'' `` We do n't have a fence around the hospital,'' <PERSON> Cappello </PERSON> said. `` It's not a correctional facility. ... He was obviously able to leave the grounds.'' <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> was unsure of the exact nature of <PERSON> Peterson </PERSON>'s mental illness. The stabbing took place on the city's Main Street, which was closed to traffic. <PERSON> Peterson </PERSON> grabbed Short from behind after she walked out of an F.W. <ORGANIZATION> Woolworth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> store and was apparently walking toward her mother. He flailed at her head and chest with a large, black-handled hunting knife, witnesses said, until two police officers and a passerby pulled him off the girl. `` Nobody was helping her,'' said a woman who would not give her name. `` People were screaming and running. He cut her on the arm and then just stood there and started stabbing her in the chest.'' <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> said <PERSON> Peterson </PERSON> was allowed to leave the hospital to have Christmas dinner with his family last year, but she said that was the only time the review board has allowed him to leave the hospital grounds. `` It definitely calls for a review to look into what happened,'' she said.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Hashemi </PERSON> <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> won <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s presidential election by a landslide, and constitutional changes also approved by voters will give him sweeping powers, according to partial returns today. <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON>, 54, who was serving as parliament speaker and commander in chief, is expected to restore links with the West, liberalize <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s economy, and soften the hard-line policies of the late <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>. The government reported a huge voter turnout and a powerful mandate for <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON>, who recently emerged as <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s most popular and powerful leader. An opposition group charged that voting hours were extended in an effort to increase a poor turnout of voters and that troops attacked some voters. Partial returns gave <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> 94 percent of the vote in 124 districts counted, according to the official <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>. It said he captured 8 million of 8.5 million votes tallied so far from Friday's polling. Public opinion polls published earlier this month predicted 86 percent of the votes for <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> and 11 percent for his opponent, <PERSON> Abass </PERSON> <PERSON> Sheibani </PERSON>. Three percent were expected not to vote. <PERSON> Sheibani </PERSON>, a 58-year-old parliament deputy from <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>, has no national political power base. The lawmaker, a candidate in the 1981 presidential race, was a student activist opposed to the late <PERSON> Shah </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Reza </PERSON> <PERSON> Pahlavi </PERSON>. <PERSON> Sheibani </PERSON> spent 13 years in prison before <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>'s Islamic Revolution toppled the monarchy in 1979. <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> died June 3. The official news agency, also citing partial returns, said 97 percent of voters approved constitutional amendments in a referendum held with the presidential elections. The consitutional changes give <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> more power than any of his predecessors. In addition to scrapping the post of prime minister, they put the president in charge of government. He will be answerable only to the 270-seat Majlis, or parliament. The changes are designed to eliminate competing power centers that have for years paralyzed the government and blocked economic reform. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s main opposition group, the <ORGANIZATION> Mujahedeen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Khalq </ORGANIZATION> or <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Warriors </ORGANIZATION>, said in a sattement released at its headquarters in <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, that the voter turnout was very poor It gave no overall numbers, but it said that at some polling stations in <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> only 1,000 of 5,000 expected voters cast ballots. Voting hours were extended by seven hours. The government said the extension was made to accommodate a large turnout of voters, but the opposition group claimed it was actually intended to bring forth more of them. Reporters said the turnout seemed sluggish Friday morning but picked up later in the day. `` The way they have been urging people to get out and vote has been very desperate,'' a <ORGANIZATION> Mujahedeen </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said in a telephone interview with The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Nicosia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>. The group also claimed that at polling stations in <PERSON> Ghani </PERSON> <PERSON> Abad </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Shahr-e-Ray </LOCATION> in south <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>, fundamentalist revolutionary Guards beat up some voters and arrested others who tried to vote against the constitutional amendments. There was no independent confirmation. Interior Minister <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Akbar </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohtashemi </PERSON> said in a television interview that his security agencies had foiled plots by opposition groups backed by `` global arrogance'' to disrupt the voting. He did not elaborate. `` Global arrogance'' is an Iranian epithet for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and its allies. Although it was a foregone conclusion, <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON>'s victory reflected even stronger support than expected. The official news agency said, `` This massive victory will give greater confidence to his adminstration.'' Almost every voter questioned Friday by correspondents outside polling stations in <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> said they chose <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> because they believed he would put the economy before revolutionary ideology. `` We know <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> ca n't perform miracles, but we feel he's the only man who can improve things,'' engineer <PERSON> Parzolah </PERSON> <PERSON> Armandi </PERSON> said after voting in <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>'s southern slums `` We're tired of lining up for food,'' said <PERSON> Masoumeh </PERSON> <PERSON> Gazian </PERSON>, a housewife in the <LOCATION> Nehdat </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islami </LOCATION> district who said she voted for <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON>. <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON>, leader of the so-called pragmatists in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s religious hierarchy, will be the <LOCATION> Islamic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>'s fourth president He will succeed <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Khamenei </PERSON>, who was chosen supreme leader after <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>'s death. <PERSON> Khamenei </PERSON> is <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON>'s main ally in the power struggle between the pragmatists and radicals, led by <PERSON> Mohtashemi </PERSON>. <PERSON> Mohtashemi </PERSON>'s allies include Prime Minister <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> <PERSON> Musavi </PERSON>, whose job will be eliminated under the constitutional amendments.

 Brush fires in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> torched houses and forced the evacuation of several communities, and <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>'s governor declared a state of extreme emergency to handle the blazes consuming thousands of acres of forest. A fast-moving fire roared through a windy tinderbox of dry grass and brush in the <LOCATION> Sierra </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> foothills today, and Sheriff's Lt. <PERSON> Greg </PERSON> <PERSON> Burton </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Fresno </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, said at least three homes had been destroyed, with 1,500 firefighters unable to control the 3,000-acre fire. At least 2,500 residents were evacuated from the communities of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Auberry </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Meadow </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lakes </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Alder </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Bald </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountain </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Basin </PERSON>, said <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Kutz </PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forestry </ORGANIZATION>. About 150 nursing home patients were among those taken to a local high school in the area 190 miles east of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. One of the evacuees, <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Burnham </PERSON>, had moved to the highland area from low-lying <LOCATION> Fresno </LOCATION> just a day before the fire _ to escape the heat. When a sheriff's deputy screamed at him to clear out of his new house, <PERSON> Burnham </PERSON> said, `` I never even came out with a shirt.'' Elsewhere in central <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, firefighters saved at least a dozen homes from a fire that burned 10,500 acres near the city of <LOCATION> Atascadero </LOCATION>. `` Miraculously, all those homes have been spared,'' <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forestry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Alsop </PERSON> said. `` The flames burned right up to them.'' About 750 firefighters had the blaze 40 percent contained early today. Officials refused to estimate when it might be fully contained, although increasing humidity and low overnight temperatures were a boon to firefighters, <PERSON> Alsop </PERSON> said. The blaze destroyed 15 to 20 outbuildings, including barns and corrals. Owners moved animals from some ranches in the area about 175 miles north of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. In the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> area community of Walnut, firefighters surrounded a fast-moving brush fire that had threatened several homes and the nearby <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Polytechnical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Pomona </LOCATION>, officials said. Campus police evacuated 800 students as the fire approached, said <PERSON> Rafael </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortiz </PERSON>, a firefighter with the <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, but the blaze was contained about 8:30 p.m. and students were allowed back into their dorm rooms on the campus 30 miles east of downtown <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, Gov. <PERSON> Cecil </PERSON> <PERSON> Andrus </PERSON> authorized military reinforcements Friday to join the battle against hundreds of forest fires. His emergency proclamation allows the state to use the National Guard. The <ORGANIZATION> Boise </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Interagency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> estimated some 3,000 people were fighting <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> fires or supporting suppression efforts against smaller blazes. More than 15,000 acres had been blackened by an estimated 500 fires, although a number of blazes were controlled by late Friday. `` Fires are continuing to pop up,'' <ORGANIZATION> Payette </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Olson </PERSON> said. `` It's going to be a long weekend for us.'' The top-priority fire in the state was the 1,500-acre <LOCATION> Fleming </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Creek </LOCATION> blaze, with towering smoke columns visible 50 miles south in <LOCATION> Boise </LOCATION>. One lane of traffic on <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> Highway 55 was closed over a two-mile section to guard against falling rocks and burning timber.

 A military tribunal has sentenced seven youths to five-year prison terms for staging anti-government demonstrations, a government newspaper said today. Also today, a spokesman for the main opposition party, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democracy </ORGANIZATION>, said as many as 1,500 people have been arrested since the second week of July. He asked not to be identified by name. Police arrested the seven youths for shouting slogans July 17 at <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION>'s Shwedagon Pagoda Buddhist temple on a religious holiday and sentenced them Friday, the Working People's Daily said. It gave few other details. On Tuesday, a military tribunal ordered the death sentence for three young members of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democracy </ORGANIZATION> who were convicted of planting a package bomb that killed two people at a government oil refinery on July 7. A Western diplomat today called Tuesday's proceedings `` a real show trial.'' `` They say that the prosecution was heard and the exhibits were shown, but the outside world has n't seen anything,'' said the diplomat in <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION>, who spoke by telephone to the <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION> on condition of anonymity. <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>, the London-based human rights organization, also criticized the sentences. `` According to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>, executions resulting from summary procedures denying the right of legal appeal and omitting other fair safeguards constitute ` the arbitrary deprivation of life,'' it said in a statement received in <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> today. <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>'s military government recently has intensified its crackdown on the political opposition while releasing common criminals under an amnesty announced July 20. Today's Working Peoples Daily said 7,326 prisoners have been freed under the order. <PERSON> Aung </PERSON> <PERSON> San </PERSON> <PERSON> Suu </PERSON> <PERSON> Kyi </PERSON> and Tin Oo, leaders of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democracy </ORGANIZATION>, were placed under house arrest on July 20. A goverment spokesman later accused them of trying to `` destroy the military and create anarchy in the country.'' The government denies Ms. <PERSON> Suu </PERSON> <PERSON> Kyi </PERSON> is on a hunger strike in her <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> home. In <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> today, the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> expressed dismay at reports that Ms. <PERSON> Suu </PERSON> <PERSON> Kyi </PERSON> is on a hunger strike. A <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> spokesman also said <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> `` deplored'' the failure of authorities to allow British consuls to visit Dr. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Aris </PERSON>, who is Ms. <PERSON> Suu </PERSON> <PERSON> Kyi </PERSON>'s husband Aris, who is British, has had his movements restricted since he recently returned to <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. The spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democracy </ORGANIZATION> said today he could not confirm that Ms. <PERSON> Suu </PERSON> <PERSON> Kyi </PERSON> was on a hunger strike because the party has been denied contact with her. The Western diplomat said detailed reports reaching his embassy from reliable sources indicate Ms. <PERSON> Suu </PERSON> <PERSON> Kyi </PERSON> is refusing food.

 <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Root </PERSON>, the lawyer who survived a mysterious gunshot and an 800-mile flight and crash into the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION>, is recovering from his injuries at his parents' home here, his father said today <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Root </PERSON>, the pilot's father, said that his son remembers little of his July 13 flight and does n't plan to talk to reporters until `` his doctor tells him he is fit enough.'' Root set out on a business trip from his home in <LOCATION> Arlington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, to <LOCATION> Rocky </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, and later told air traffic controllers he was having trouble breathing. He put his plane on autopilot and military planes kept watch on him until his plane ran out of fuel and ditched near the <LOCATION> Bahamas </LOCATION>. Root said he was unconscious until his plane hit the water and did not know how he received a gunshot wound to the abdomen, which doctors noticed after his rescue. He was released from a hospital in <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, on Monday. The reason for his illness during the flight and the source of the wound remain as much a mystery to Root as they are to those who have investigated his flight, Root's father told The <ORGANIZATION> Columbus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dispatch </ORGANIZATION>. `` He says it's not a story, it's just what happened,'' he said. During his convalesence in this town 55 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION>, Root has visited the family doctor for treatment of a collapsed lung and seen the family dentist, but otherwise has stayed at home, his father said. Root was sued Thursday in federal court in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> by a group of investors who tried to get an <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> license in 1987 to build an FM radio station. They claim his actions cost them $ 125,000. Root specialized in that type of litigation. But the lawsuit claims he committed legal malpractice by lying about some things, failing to attend to details associated with getting a license, and keeping the investors from getting a cash settlement from another group that ultimately got the license. `` I do n't care to comment,'' Root told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> when asked about the suit today.

<HEAD>Trouble With DC-10: Real Problems Or Bum Rap?</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BRISCOE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 With two major crashes in nine days, a rash of worrisome incidents and a troubled history, talk of eight million hours of safe flying is n't enough to calm renewed concern about safety of the DC-10. An airline passengers group wants all of the more than 450 triple-jet DC-10s grounded, and safety groups are calling for design changes. But federal officials and some aviation experts say the plane's bad reputation is a bad rap They say the airliner has proved itself safe. As the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> tries to find what caused the July 19 crash of a <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> DC-10 at <LOCATION> Sioux </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, that killed 111 people and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> investigators probe the wreckage of a <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> Air DC-10 in <LOCATION> Tripoli </LOCATION> that killed at least 75 people on Thursday, 50 airlines around the world are still flying DC-10s. Other recent incidents involving the wide-bodied airliner built by <ORGANIZATION> McDonnell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION> include: _ A <ORGANIZATION> Canadian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> model that lost a wheel but landed safely in <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION>. _ A <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> plane that landed without incident in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> after reporting hydraulic problems. _ Another United jet that made an unscheduled stop at <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> after a bird was sucked into an engine. _ Yet another <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> DC-10 that slid off a runway in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> a day before the <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> crash. Although none of the incidents caused injury or serious damage, they have added to the aura of distrust around the jumbo airliner that has been in service nearly two decades and carried 745 million passengers. `` The question of whether the DC-10 is a safe aircraft naturally pops into people's minds,'' said <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> aviation attorney <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stengel </PERSON>. `` But people who understand the sequence of events in the <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> crash understand it was probably a very, very rare catastrophic incident.'' Despite reassurances from the experts and from <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON>, who last week declared the DC-10 safe, the airliner has become the butt of jokes, loose talk and some genuine concerns. Travel agents say that since the <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> crash, more passengers are choosey about what plane they fly and some want to sit in sections where most of the 185 survivors of Flight 232 sat. A reservations clerk, speaking on condition that neither she nor her airline be identified, said some customers joke about the DC-10. One man suggested he might book his mother-in-law on one, she said. Rep. <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Applegate </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ohio </LOCATION>, prompted laughter during congressional debate Friday when he remarked about a colleague concerned with smoking on airliners: `` This issue may be the least of his problems if he's flying a DC-10.'' But aviation experts say the problems facing the airliner are not amusing and are typical of the concerns raised in the public mind after a serious crash or series of crashes, even when they are later blamed on maintenance, pilot error or other problems unrelated to safety of the airliner itself. <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> Cole </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> aviation consultant, said he would still fly in DC-10s. `` Eight million hours without a problem is a much higher guarantee than I could get on any new car right now,'' he said. According to <ORGANIZATION> McDonnell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> insurance analyst said that prior to the <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> accident, DC-10s had flown 8 million hours without an accident. `` Flying safety is serious business and deserves responsible treatment,'' said <PERSON> Morten </PERSON> <PERSON> Beyer </PERSON>, chairman of <LOCATION> Avmart </LOCATION>, an independent aviation appraisal firm. <PERSON> Beyer </PERSON> questioned the conclusions and data of the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airline </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Passengers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, which called last week for all DC-10s to be grounded. The group, which claims 110,000 members, said 17 DC-10s have been destroyed since the model was introduced in 1970 _ a worse record than other wide-bodied airliners. <PERSON> Beyer </PERSON> said the figures are misleading. He said 18 DC-10s actually have been destroyed, but only three were due to accidents involving mechanical problems. These include the <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> crash, where investigators are trying to determine why the plane's tail engine blew up, destroying hydraulic flight controls. Another involved an <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> DC-10 that crashed on takeoff from <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> in 1979, becoming what is still the worst <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aviation disaster in history with 274 people killed. The crash was blamed on faulty maintenance. Also, in 1974, a <ORGANIZATION> Turkish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> DC-10 crashed over <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, killing 346 people after a cargo door popped off, the cabin decompressurized, the cargo hold roof buckled, and control lines were severed. A court order grounded all DC-10s for 37 days after the 1979 <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> crash, and the aircraft was modified for safety after both the <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> crashes. But <PERSON> Beyer </PERSON> said 15 other DC-10s were destroyed by ground fires, an aborted takeoff, bad landings, other pilot errors or birds in an engine. Among more recent concerns raised about DC-10s is Rep. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Dingell </PERSON>'s suggestion that spare military parts might have been used in the engine of the DC-10 that crashed in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>. The engine builder, <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION>, says this is impossible, but the <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> Democrat asked the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> to investigate. Adding further to <ORGANIZATION> McDonnell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION>'s woes is a report last week of sabotage of some new airliners at its factory in <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, including severing of the hydraulic system on an assembly line. Company officials said the incidents were not related to the DC-10 crash, but they were investigating. Neither DC-10 that crashed recently was very old in aircraft terms, but the DC-10 is receiving increased scrutiny as the whole fleet ages. Older Boeing-built jetliners already have been subjected to mandatory government repairs as they age. The focus will switch to <ORGANIZATION> McDonnell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION> planes as an industry task force prepares recommendations for similar orders applying to the DC-10 and other planes built by the company. The DC-10 is no longer in production. It is to be replaced by <ORGANIZATION> McDonnell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION>' new MD-11 model which has yet to leave the factory.

<DATELINE>KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The rainy season has hit southern <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION>, and a relief operation intended to get food to the region is behind schedule and hindered by soggy roads and fears of rebel attacks. In <LOCATION> Kosti </LOCATION> south of <LOCATION> Khartoum </LOCATION>, 17,500 tons of emergency supplies are just now being loaded on <LOCATION> Nile </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> barges that were to have gone south weeks ago. Boxcars loaded with 1,350 tons of other supplies are parked in a railroad yard, immovable for fear the train will be attacked by rebels or starving peasants, as previous ones were. While nearly three-fourths of the targeted 105,000 tons reached redistribution points before the rains, which will make them inaccessible, relief workers say pockets of potential starvation remain in southern <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION>, an area the size of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. `` One can not speak of a disaster for the moment, but some of these areas will have trouble,'' said <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> <PERSON> Junod </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION>. `` The extent depends on the ecological situation and the peace talks.'' Operation Lifeline <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION>, coordinated by the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> and using trucks, trains and barges, was to have provided enough supplies to help people displaced by the southern civil war survive the summer monsoon-like rains. Officials report that 72,000 tons have been moved. The <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> mounted a smaller airborne operation that failed to meet its goal, transporting 6,000 tons of a planned 7,000 to 8,000 tons. `` The situation in the rebel-held territories is a bit tricky,'' <PERSON> Junod </PERSON> said. `` We've not been able to send in enough food because of the onset of the rains.'' Trucks and trains are virtually useless in the rainy season. Neither the railroad bed nor the roads in the south, mostly rutted pathways, are constructed well enough to withstand the downpours. In 1988, <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> officials say 250,000 southerners died of starvation, flood or disease during the rainy season. The estimate of some Western relief workers is twice that. Both <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> and other relief officials said Operation Lifeline had to succeed to save 100,000 people from starving to death this summer. Some relief workers in this wretchedly poor country, <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s largest with only a tiny network of roads and railways, blame mismanagement and lack of clear planning for the failure of both the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> efforts to reach their goals, despite the huge expenditures The <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> airlift cost $ 35 million from December, when it began, to June. Operation Lifeline <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION>, which began April 1, was scheduled to cost $ 132 million, which donors pledged at a March conference in <LOCATION> Khartoum </LOCATION>. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Grant </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> secretary-general's special representative for the project, announced in mid-July a need for an additional $ 40 million. With previous increases, that brought the total to $ 200 million. Both sides in the civil war generally have honored a cease-fire since May, but unknown gunmen have attacked relief trucks and trains, with 11 people killed and several boxcars looted. A 45-car train loaded with 1,350 tons of relief supplies was to have left July 17 from <LOCATION> Babanousa </LOCATION> in southern <LOCATION> Kordofan </LOCATION>, north of the war zone, en route to <LOCATION> Aweil </LOCATION>, a major center for displaced people in the south. Days later, a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> official said the train would not leave without assurances from the rebel <ORGANIZATION> Sudan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> that it would not be attacked. The train is to carry food and medicines to places held by both the rebels and the government. Politics also have interfered with the relief operation. Operations were suspended temporarily after a military coup June 30 ousted the civilian government of Prime Minister <PERSON> Sadek </PERSON> <PERSON> el-Mahdi </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>' <PERSON> Grant </PERSON> said the new leader, Lt. Gen. <PERSON> Omar </PERSON> <PERSON> Hassan </PERSON> <PERSON> el-Bashir </PERSON>, `` took great pains to reaffirm the support of the new government to continuing Operation Lifeline <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION>.'' The government previously put obstacles in the way, claiming agencies wanted to feed rebels trying to take over <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION>. Rebel commanders also have used food as a weapon, even shooting at relief planes flying into rebel areas.

 The country's largest illegal poppy field has been discovered near a hospital that treats drug addicts, news reports said Saturday.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and congressional Democrats are engaged in a game of chicken over how to finance the multibillion-dollar bailout of hundreds of failed savings institutions. On Friday, the squawking began. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> paraded before television cameras at three separate news conferences to outline their views, one day after <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> negotiators sealed a compromise deal on the landmark legislation. The president favors a complex scheme to pay for the bailout by borrowing the money through a new, quasi-private agency. That has the advantage of keeping $ 50 billion in <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; L spending out of the budget deficit, which, if it goes too high, triggers automatic spending cuts under the Gramm-Rudman law. Democrats support the plan adopted by the <ORGANIZATION> House-Senate </ORGANIZATION> conference, which they say is cheaper and more honest, to borrow the money through the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. However, that would balloon the deficit over the next three years. Democrats evade the automatic spending cuts by simply waiving Gramm-Rudman. Republicans say the administration's method keeps the spending discipline of Gramm-Rudman in place. Democrats say <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is just engaging in a more subtle kind of subterfuge. Both agree that the other side is holding up urgent legislation needed to staunch the industry's hemorrhaging and neither wants to be blamed for that. The stakes are high. S & amp; Ls are losing an estimated $ 20 million a day, $ 833,333 an hour, $ 13,888 a minute and $ 231.48 a second. That's a lot of blame to shoulder and it hardly seems worth it for either side to get tarred over what at first glance seems like nothing more than an accounting question. But, the issue is important, not now, but over the next several years, because it will have a major role in the annual jousting over how to balance the budget, through spending cuts or tax increases. Even though both plans alleviate the danger of an automatic spending cut, politically, their effect could n't be more different. Democrats are betting that if they win on <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; L spending, and the reported budget deficit approaches the record set during the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> years instead of getting better, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> wo n't be willing to endure the kind of drastic spending cuts that would be needed to reduce it. They believe he will feel that much more pressure to abandon his `` Read my lips: No new taxes'' pledge repeated over and over during the 1988 campaign. The issue comes to a head this week when the S & amp; L compromise package reaches the full <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, which must approve it before it goes to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> for his signature. Sen. <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Gramm </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Texas </LOCATION>, has vowed `` unless God palsies my voice'' to protect the deficit-reduction law that bears his name. <PERSON> Gramm </PERSON> has the signatures of 41 senators, including his own, pledging to reject the S & amp; L compromise. Under the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>'s rules, that's enough to block it. On the other hand, if <PERSON> Gramm </PERSON> is successful the legislation bounces back to the <ORGANIZATION> House-Senate </ORGANIZATION> conference, where majority Democrats prevail. So, the two sides are locked in a stalemate. Either can tie up the legislation, but neither has the stomach to do that for very long. The winner likely will be the side that is most successful at blaming the other for delay. Expect the squawking to grow louder.

 An economic slump since the Palestinian uprising and the government's increased interest in the occupied lands have left this desert town and others like it with soaring unemployment and the threat of unrest. `` It has become a catastrophe. Unemployment is a time bomb in this town,'' said <PERSON> Rahel </PERSON> <PERSON> Messika </PERSON>, director of the government employment agency in <LOCATION> Yeroham </LOCATION>, a cluster of neglected tenements housing 7,000 people in the <LOCATION> Negev </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Desert </LOCATION>, 90 miles south of <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>. Analysts say high unemployment in small towns may cause tension between rich and poor and between Jews of European and Middle Eastern origin. It also could harden anti-Arab sentiment among Israeli Jews who believe Palestinians working for lower wages are stealing their jobs. In <LOCATION> Yeroham </LOCATION>, the only activity at mid-morning on a summer weekday is at the unemployment office, where the jobless come looking for work they know does not exist. Idle, middle-aged men seek relief in the shade next to empty cafes and grocery stores. <PERSON> Yeroham </PERSON> was founded in the 1950s to house impoverished immigrants as part of an effort by the late Prime Minister <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Ben-Gurion </PERSON> to develop the <LOCATION> Negev </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Desert </LOCATION>. The town has relied on a bottle factory and two metalworks. But the plants have laid off 150 of the town's 2,000 workers, and unemployment is officially pegged at 10 percent. `` At least an additional 10 percent do n't bother to register any more. They know no new offers have come in,'' <PERSON> Messika </PERSON> said. Young people recently demobilized from the army are leaving <PERSON> Yeroham </PERSON>, hoping to find work and a more vigorous lifestyle in cities such as <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION>. The unemployment problem in such towns has become a major focus of concern in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, taking precedence in newspapers over the 19-month Palestinian uprising against Israeli rule in the occupied lands. Last month, mayors of 30 development towns chained themselves to a fence outside Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s office to press demands for economic aid. The 9.7 percent jobless figure for May was a 20-year high for the Jewish state. The government estimates that the June figure will break a record 10 percent. <PERSON> Ruth </PERSON> <PERSON> Klinov </PERSON>, a labor relations expert at <ORGANIZATION> Hebrew </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, said the <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> uprising, which has disrupted the construction industry and badly hurt tourism, contributed 2 percent to the overall unemployment rate. The Histadrut, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s trade union federation, organized a two-hour nationwide strike by 1.2 million workers to protest unemployment in late July. Experts say more strikes may be in the offing. `` There is a great potential for violence in unemployment, which may eventually be directed against the Histadrut itself if they do n't get results,'' said <PERSON> Noah </PERSON> <PERSON> Levin-Epstein </PERSON>, a sociologist at <ORGANIZATION> Tel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviv </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. One sign of the unrest was a wildcat strike by 50 laid-off employees of the Urdan metalworks in <LOCATION> Netanya </LOCATION>, which builds <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s main battle tank, the Merkava The workers held their managers hostage four hours to protest the dismissal orders. <PERSON> Klinov </PERSON> said as long as the government refuses to bail out private companies and maintains a policy of privatizing state-owned companies, `` an unemployment rate of at least 10 percent is here to stay.'' In an effort to halt the growth of unemployment, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s Cabinet approved $ 137.5 million to help create new jobs, especially in development towns Like other development towns, <PERSON> Yeroham </PERSON> was built around light industries and was heavily subsidized. But in recent years the government has cut back support and diverted funds to develop settlements in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, which got $ 150 million last year. The result is an economic slowdown that has affected everyone from grocery stores to banks. <PERSON> Shalom </PERSON> <PERSON> Benvinisti </PERSON>, 35, an immigrant from <LOCATION> Morocco </LOCATION>, lost his job as a bank teller five years ago and has worked temporary jobs to support his diabetic wife and three children. Even temporary work vanished two months ago, and he now relies on unemployment benefits of $ 450 a month. After six months, the benefit will be cut in half. `` My kids know that we ca n't buy them new clothes or the proper school books. but they are good about it. They do n't complain. They understand how hard it is,'' he said. <PERSON> Benvinisti </PERSON> took a government-run training course, learning to make metal frames for concrete casting. But he still can not find a job because `` they all want years of experience.'' <PERSON> Yoav </PERSON> <PERSON> Peled </PERSON>, a political scientist at <ORGANIZATION> Tel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviv </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, said a survey of 832 Israelis in eight development towns indicated high unemployment has increased support for extreme anti-Arab parties. `` They feel that the Palestinians are forcing wages down and are stealing their jobs,'' said <PERSON> Peled </PERSON> said. Unemployment is also high among 800,000 Arabs with Israeli citizenship. In predominantly <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> <PERSON> Nazareth </PERSON>, the official jobless rate is 10 percent with an additional 12 percent unregistered, according to city spokesman <PERSON> Fahoum </PERSON> <PERSON> Safwan </PERSON>. `` High unemployment among Arab-Israelis will strengthen their growing identification with the Palestinian uprising, as economic frustrations are added to political tensions,'' <PERSON> Levin-Epstein </PERSON> said.

 The recent barring of black teen-agers from a pool owned by the <ORGANIZATION> Jaycees </ORGANIZATION> resulted from tradition and habit that lives on in this small town, residents say. The <LOCATION> Saluda </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Swim </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Tennis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> capitulated quickly when its whites-only rule was challenged. It said it will admit blacks when it reopens Saturday after reviewing all its policies to ensure they are non-discriminatory. Such change could have occurred only with the involvement of outsiders, say residents in this town of 3,000, 40 percent of whom are black. The local Jaycees were pressured by their national organization after the July 13 incident involving three black teen-agers with a group of <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Methodist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> members from across the state. People living in the town knew that the pool was for whites _ black residents swam in ponds and were unwilling to challenge the status quo, both black and white residents said. `` Blacks in <LOCATION> Saluda </LOCATION> know what's what,'' said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Logan </PERSON>, the town's first, and only, black council member. At <LOCATION> M.J. </LOCATION>'s Cafe last week, <PERSON> Charlie </PERSON> <PERSON> Mason </PERSON> sat behind a wooden picnic table on the right side of the restaurant, where he and other black residents have sat for years. The left side of the restaurant, which is separated by a wall, was patronized by three white customers eating lunch. `` I've just been sitting on this side all the time,'' <PERSON> Mason </PERSON>, 58, said when asked why he restricts himself to one side of the restaurant. The swim club ended its restrictions when threatened with eviction by the Jaycees, but without apparent bitterness. `` In 1989, it's the moral thing to do,'' club president <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Booth </PERSON> said. `` Really, everybody treated it as a private membership club as any city has country clubs,'' said <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Shealy </PERSON>, editor of the <LOCATION> Saluda </LOCATION> Standard-Sentinel. `` I hope the whole town is not treated as racist.'' <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cobbler </LOCATION>, who, like <PERSON> Shealy </PERSON>, is white, agreed. `` We have lived here with it all these years and we've never had any problem. They call it racism and it gets attention. I just hope it does n't create a big problem.'' Cobbler, 24, referred to blacks and whites in <LOCATION> Saluda </LOCATION> as `` family.'' <LOCATION> Saluda </LOCATION> is in rural <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, 45 miles west of <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>. It sits in an area known for peaches, livestock and textiles. Stores close after lunch on Wednesday, and the biggest news had been the upcoming celebration of <LOCATION> Saluda </LOCATION> as birthplace of <LOCATION> Alamo </LOCATION> heroes <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Barret </PERSON> <PERSON> Travis </PERSON> and <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Butler </PERSON> <PERSON> Bonham </PERSON>. The swim club's pool policy became the talk of the town, though, after it refused to admit the black church members who were part of a group of 66 who had spent the day renovating a dilapidated home. Club officials noted that the pool site was willed to the town in 1933 by dairyman <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wheeler </PERSON> with the provision that it be used as a recreation area for white people. In 1955, one year after the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> declared unconstitutional separate facilities for blacks and whites, the town deeded the property to the Jaycees with the whites-only provision intact. The Jaycees leased the pool to the private club. No blacks ever applied for membership, <PERSON> Booth </PERSON> said. State law does not address racial segregation in private clubs, state attorney general's spokesman <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Dillard </PERSON> said. But lawyers say racial covenants are unenforceable. While some say they're now reassessing practices and attitudes that have lived for years in town, others maintain that <LOCATION> Saluda </LOCATION>'s problems are no different from those elsewhere in the country `` Racism is all over the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Logan </PERSON> said. `` It's the same. It's just done in different ways.''

 Two new <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> audits say rent subsidies were improperly inflated by $ 6 million for two housing projects involving former agency officials. The internal audits completed this month by the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION>'s inspector general found that local housing authorities in <LOCATION> Tulsa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Okla. </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Gastonia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, allowed a mortgage company to establish the rents for the projects, a violation of <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> guidelines. The Tulsa project, Windsong Apartments, is owned by a partnership that includes four former <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> officials _ <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Winn </PERSON>, <PERSON> Lance </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> and <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Queenan </PERSON>. All four also had stakes in projects reviewed as part of a nationwide audit released in April that cited excessive rents as one of several problems afflicting the Section 8 Moderate Rehabilitation Program. The <LOCATION> Gastonia </LOCATION> development, Four Seasons Apartments, is owned by a group that hired <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island-based </LOCATION> consultant <PERSON> Judith </PERSON> <PERSON> Siegal </PERSON> to help obtain the lucrative rehabilitation subsidies. Ms. <PERSON> Siegal </PERSON> was among the lesser-known, but more successful, consultants cited in the earlier report, which found that <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> was being overcharged more than $ 400 million over the 15-year life of the rehabilitation subsidies because of inflated rents. The mortgage company that established the rents, <ORGANIZATION> Benton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mortgage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Knoxville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>, also has figured prominently in an ongoing investigation of abuses at the agency. The company co-insured the projects with <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION>. All the audits noted that former <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> officials had won a significant share of the rehabilitation money and that prominent Republican consultants were successful in steering money to their clients. Since the report in April, <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> has been the subject of internal, congressional and <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> investigations. Mismanagement and abuses have been found in a number of the multibillion-dollar agency's programs. <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> secretary <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> suspended the Moderate Rehabilitation Program. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, in its budget bill for <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> next year, included no new funding for the program. The two new audits obtained last week under the Freedom of Information Act were not part of the nationwide review. The audit of the Tulsa project, completed July 11, found that the <LOCATION> Tulsa </LOCATION> housing authority misinterpreted <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> guidelines and allowed <PERSON> Benton </PERSON> to calculate the rents for the 202-unit Windsong complex. As a result, auditors said, <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> already had paid more than $ 200,000 in excess of what it should have since the subsidies began in 1987 and could overpay by as much as $ 3.4 million over the life of the contract unless the subsidies are reduced. The findings of the <LOCATION> Gastonia </LOCATION> audit, completed July 24, were very similar. Investigators found that the <ORGANIZATION> Gastonia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION> allowed <PERSON> Benton </PERSON> to set the rents, which auditors said were calculated with a faulty formula and included ineligible costs. As a result, <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> had paid $ 63,000 in excessive subsidies from late 1987 through March and over the term of the contract will overpay rents by more than $ 2.5 million unless the subsidies are recalculated. In both the <LOCATION> Tulsa </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gastonia </LOCATION> audits, <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> urged the local housing officials and regional <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> officials to recalculate the subsidies and to recover the overpaid amounts. That process is just getting under way.

<HEAD>Priest Says Racism Permeates Catholic Church in U.S.</HEAD>

 Racism permeates the <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, several clerics said, warning that more blacks could follow the lead of a priest who set up an unauthorized African American congregation. Seven black church leaders, speaking Friday after a national conference of black clergy, called on the church to address the needs of minorities and move blacks to positions of authority. `` The church has bought into the racist practices of the American culture,'' said the Rev. <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohea </PERSON>, a pastor from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>. The news conference at <ORGANIZATION> Marquette </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> followed a joint conference of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Clergy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Caucus </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sisters </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Seminarians </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. Much discussed was the case of the Rev. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stallings </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, priest who was suspended for setting up an independent African-American congregation without permission of his archbishop. The Rev. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> McKnight </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Opelousas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> La. </LOCATION>, warned that others could follow <PERSON> Stallings </PERSON>' lead. `` We're ready to take up the cross and commit ourselves to change. I'm firmly convinced you're going to see changes,'' <PERSON> McKnight </PERSON> said. `` There are some of us who are ready to do exactly what <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Stallings </PERSON> did,'' he said. Responding to the criticism, the Rev. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Perry </PERSON>, judicial vicar of the <ORGANIZATION> Milwaukee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Archdiocese </ORGANIZATION> and a member of the clergy caucus, said he believed `` those comments would be rather strong from my perspective.'' Over the last 50 years, the <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> has reached out to various minority groups, <PERSON> Perry </PERSON> said. `` In my association with many black priests, I find them extremely loyal to the church and willing to work with the system for steady and certain improvement,'' he said. Sister <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> Haley </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> said the church must include minority group members and women at the highest decision-making levels of its dioceses. `` The manner in which we do business is essentially a racist system, and we've got to change the system,'' the sister said.

 <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s new president, <PERSON> Hashemi </PERSON> <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON>, will have to walk a political tightrope to achieve his expected goals of rebuilding links with the West and liberalizing life in the <LOCATION> Islamic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>. He has been armed with more power than any of his three predecessors because of constitutional amendments approved in a national referendum held alongside Friday's presidential election. The official <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> received 94 percent of the 8.5 million votes counted by Saturday. The constitutional changes received 97 percent support. It did not say how many people voted. The leader of <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>'s so-called pragmatists will have to move carefully to avoid triggering a backlash from radicals dedicated to preserving the ideological purity of <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>'s Islamic revolution Under the constitutional reforms, initiated by <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> himself before he died June 3, the post of prime minister will be scrapped to put the government under the presidency, which had been a largely ceremonial post. <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON>, 54, has authority to appoint or dismiss the Cabinet. He will head a newly formed <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, which will control <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s vast security apparatus and military, in addition to the economy and planning. The constitutional amendments are designed to eliminate rival power centers that have paralyzed government for years and delayed economic and social reforms. In theory, they should create a more cohesive and effective government. <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> was elected by Iranians eager for change after 10 years of revolutionary turmoil, a war with <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, economic hardship and the rigid Islamic code imposed by <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>. Voters interviewed in <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> during Friday's polling were unanimous in saying they were looking to <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON>, in the forefront of <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>'s revolution from the start, to improve their lot. But <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s 50 million people, battered by runaway inflation, high prices, unemployment and shortages of just about everthing, may be expecting too much too soon. <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> has sought to dampen expectations, saying, `` I will try to realize what is practicable.'' He underlined in a television interview last week that his hopes for a new era `` may or may not square with the potentials at hand.'' <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> has acknowledged he faces daunting problems _ an economy run into the ground by the eight-year Iran-Iraq war, poor management and a decade of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s self-imposed isolation. <PERSON> Mohammad-Hassan </PERSON> <PERSON> Sazegar </PERSON>, deputy minister of heavy industry, outlined the problems with unusual candor at a seminar on industrial problems last month, saying the economy is in its worst shape ever. `` Production is lowest in our industries,'' he said. `` Bottlenecks are strangling production.'' <PERSON> Sazegar </PERSON> said the 120 factories supervised by his ministry are producing at only 30 percent of capacity because of shortages of raw materials, spare parts and energy. `` We frequently prevaricate by resorting to emotional sloganeering'' to solve problems, he said. `` For the last 10 years we have offered the wrong solutions and weakened the economy.'' Such frank comments indicate that more realistic thinking is emerging in the upper echelons of the leadership than was possible while <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> was alive, dominating every aspect of Iranian life with stern Islamic inflexibility. <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> and his main ally, <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Khamenei </PERSON>, who replaced <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> as <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s supreme religious leader, favor a free-market system to revitalize the economy. They also know that large-scale foreign investment is needed to improve the economy and carry out postwar reconstruction, and that it will come only if relations with the West are restored. They are opposed by revolutionary hard-liners like <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> <PERSON> Musavi </PERSON>, the outgoing prime minister, and Interior Minister <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Akbar </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohtashemi </PERSON>, who say foreign economic participation will dilute the revolution's ideological purity. So far, the fractious leadership has displayed unexpected unity to ensure a smooth transition of power since <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> died. But diplomats and analysts believe that if the radicals perceive <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> to be straying from <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>'s ideological legacy, they will challenge him. <PERSON> Khamenei </PERSON> and <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> have adroitly outmaneuvered the radicals in recent weeks. <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> began moving his allies into positions of influence weeks before his election. They included <PERSON> Rajai </PERSON> <PERSON> Khorassani </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s former <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassador, who ousted hard-liner <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Sadeq </PERSON> <PERSON> Khalkhali </PERSON> as chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>'s Foreign Policy Committee In foreign policy, the new president has reaffirmed that he will adhere to <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>'s `` neither East nor West'' decree. But he has stressed: `` We do not want to strain relations with countries which would like to have healthy ties with us.'' There are indications <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> has begun reactivating his efforts to improve relations with the West. Diplomatic sources said <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> is moving to boost relations with <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> and that <PERSON> Khazempour </PERSON> <PERSON> Ardebili </PERSON>, former deputy oil minister, is likely to be appointed ambassador there soon. A Canadian delegation visited <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> with little fanfare earlier this month to sign an agreement that permits <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> to open a purchasing office in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> to buy badly needed high technology equipment for <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s vital oil industry, which earns 95 percent of the country's foreign exchange.

 Six months after President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s inaugural speech offering the hand of bipartisanship to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Democrats say the honeymoon is on the rocks. Perhaps the low point in the relationship came late last week, when the Democrat-controlled <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> hammered the administration on its defense plans by slashing weapons systems <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> favored and adding some he did n't. But it had been deteriorating for weeks, as the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> negotiated positions with congressional Democrats on a wide range of issues and courted their votes only to have <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> lawmakers and campaign operatives later undermine the agreements. Democrats complained that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was playing a public `` good guy'' role, calling for political peace and harmony, while privately signaling his GOP troops to attack from the rear. `` I think the president is going to find his good will here is going to diminish,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Sander </PERSON> <PERSON> Levin </PERSON>, D-Mich. `` That's not a threat, it's just a reality. Particularly galling to <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> leaders has been <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s eagerness to seek an amendment to the Constitution against flag desecration to counter a recent <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> decision, and his use of a speech at the Iwo Jima memorial to put pressure on <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to act. They also believe that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has been busily making expensive promises, from a $ 100 million development program for <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> to a capital gains tax break and a manned mission to <LOCATION> Mars </LOCATION>, then handing <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> the bills to pay. In remarkably candid comments last week, <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Minority Leader <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Michel </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Ill </LOCATION>., indicated that White House Chief of Staff <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> was indeed fully involved in the strategy `` to develop the wedge issues'' such as the flag that would put Democrats on the defensive `` That does not bode well for a bipartisan working relationship with the new Democratic leadership team'' in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, said Rep. <PERSON> Beryl </PERSON> <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ark </LOCATION>., chairman of the party's <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> campaign organization `` You ca n't look for ` wedge issues' and still look for cooperation in a Democratic-controlled <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> said, adding that the result would be legislative stalemate. `` And in a stalemated government, it's always the president who's hurt.'' `` We believe there's a pattern,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Steny </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoyer </PERSON>, D-Md., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Democratic Caucus `` The president says nice things, and on the other hand <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> says ` use this as a wedge issue.' They're talking out of two sides of their mouth.'' A possible victim of the ill will could be the hoped-for agreement between <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on a fiscal year 1991 budget outline. Talk of reaching such an accord early is no longer heard, and Speaker <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>, D-Wash., hinted recently that it could be abandoned entirely <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> continued to insist Friday that he is not looking for a fight with <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and will continue to be conciliatory. `` I have to work with these people,'' the president said. `` I have never been too hot at being a name-caller.'' But Democrats seem increasingly less willing to take such comments at face value. `` <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> wants ` kinder and gentler' while his people are gnawing your legs off,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Byron </PERSON> <PERSON> Dorgan </PERSON>, D-N. Proponents of the wedge strategy, from <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> to House GOP Whip <PERSON> Newt </PERSON> <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Rollins </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, `` have absolutely no interest in anything except burning the barn down,'' he said. `` If -LRB- <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> -RRB- is going to have a two-track system, that's not going to work ... What track is the president on?'' More than 80 Democrats expressed a similar sentiment on Friday, complaining to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in a letter that <PERSON> Rollins </PERSON>' organization took more than 20 of them to task in news releases for supporting the president's position against random drug testing for <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> employees in a floor vote last month. `` It was a difficult political vote for those of us who care about the war on drugs,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoagland </PERSON>, D-Neb., one of the victims of the press releases `` It's just inexcusable.'' Another signer of the letter, Rep. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Stallings </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Idaho </LOCATION>, recalled <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s inaugural statement that `` the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people await action. They did n't send us here to bicker. They ask us to rise above the merely partisan.'' `` That was the line that got the best response'' in the January speech, he said. `` But it's become a one-way street, as I see it. And what will happen is we'll stop supporting him, and they'll wind up with a lot of problems that will be of their own making.''

<HEAD>Committee Adds Funds for Vice President's Mansion</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> committee tacked an extra $ 200,000 on next year's appropriation for care of the government mansion occupied by Vice President <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> as the result of some sharp lobbying by his wife, the Congressional Quarterly reported Saturday. When <PERSON> Marilyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> decided she wanted to convert space on the third floor into bedrooms for her three young children, she turned, not to Budget Director <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Darman </PERSON>, but to Aubrey A. `` Tex'' <PERSON> Gunnels </PERSON>, a powerful aide to the subcommittee which has funding jurisdiction over the Executive Office of the President, the magazine said. And that is why the $ 18.4 billion <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Postal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> spending bill approved Tuesday by the full <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appropriations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> contains $ 578,000 for the `` care, maintenance and operation'' of the vice president's residence _ more than twice last year's figure and $ 200,000 more than requested by the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, the article said. <PERSON> Gunnels </PERSON> is staff director of the Appropriations subcommittee on the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Postal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> and General Government, whose chairman is Rep. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Roybal </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Calif </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Gunnels </PERSON> has worked on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> since 1958 The magazine said that at <PERSON> Marilyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s personal invitation, the 71-year-old native of <LOCATION> Lubbock </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, visited the mansion last spring to review her plans for installing several new bedrooms and a bath in a third-floor area now used for storage. Mrs. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> declined to comment on the visit, but her chief of staff <PERSON> Denise </PERSON> <PERSON> Balzano </PERSON>, said that while the vice president's wife had outlined her ideas for the space, she had made no formal request for extra funds. In the wake of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> committee's action, `` It looks like -LRB- <LOCATION> Gunnels </LOCATION> -RRB- has been helpful,'' Ms. <PERSON> Balzano </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Gunnels </PERSON> declined to discuss his role. `` Just say that the committee was informed that the vice president's residence needs some more bedrooms,'' he told the magazine. <PERSON> Roybal </PERSON> said that `` Had I gone out to see -LRB- the mansion -RRB-, I would have recommended it myself.'' The 96-year-old Queen Anne-style residence is on the lush, tree-lined grounds of the <ORGANIZATION> Naval </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Observatory </ORGANIZATION>, about two miles from the White House. Formerly the quarters of the chief of naval operations, it became the official residence of the vice president in 1974.

 The judicial system is struggling with communications and legal challenges in trying three deaf men charged with murdering a service station attendant in 1976. Police and prosecutors have used sign-language interpreters to communicate with the defendants, but one defense attorney says that may be inadequate to convey the nuances of court testimony and cross-examination. Sign language is n't even satisfactory for friendly meetings with her client, said <PERSON> Tricia </PERSON> <PERSON> Jenkins </PERSON>, a public defender. `` There's always the fear that he does n't understand,'' she said last week. The case involves the slaying of <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> <PERSON> Deland </PERSON> <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON>, a service station attendant in <LOCATION> Marion </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, who was killed in a Feb. 3, 1976, holdup that netted the bandits $ 100 to $ 200 cash. <PERSON> Ricki </PERSON> <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodgers </PERSON>, 35, of <LOCATION> Lakeland </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Elliott </PERSON>, 35, of <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Augustine </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, 39, of <LOCATION> Huntsville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ala. </LOCATION>, are charged with first-degree murder in the case. The men are being held without bail in the <LOCATION> Marion </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jail </LOCATION> pending their trial, tentatively set for September. Ms. <PERSON> Jenkins </PERSON> said she's attempting to negotiate a plea agreement in <PERSON> Rodgers </PERSON> case. Assistant State Attorney <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON> said plea negotiations with <PERSON> Rodgers </PERSON> and <PERSON> Elliott </PERSON> are under way. The case was listed as unsolved until mid-January, when detectives got a tip. The information resulted in the arrest of <PERSON> Rodgers </PERSON> and <PERSON> Elliott </PERSON> in Febraury and <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> in June. Since the men were arrested, police, prosecutors and defense attorneys have had to balance protecting their rights against the problems created by their handicaps. <PERSON> Rene </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, executive director of <ORGANIZATION> Deaf </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, has acted as a sign-language interpreter for police and prosecutors in dealing with the men, who have varying degrees of communication skills. Ms. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said interpreters `` have to be unbiased and be able to walk the fence'' and be careful that what they sign is an accurate translation of what is said. But she admits there are drawbacks. For example, <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Language </ORGANIZATION> does n't have a sign for `` weapon.'' There are signs for `` gun,'' and `` knife,'' but the language lacks a symbol for the general concept. Ms. <PERSON> Jenkins </PERSON> represents <PERSON> Rodgers </PERSON>, who can hear sounds with the use of hearing aids. She worries that his rights have been violated and her effectiveness as a lawyer has been diminished because of his partial deafness. After reviewing the tapes of his interrogation by police, Ms. <PERSON> Jenkins </PERSON> said she feels the interpreter may have summarized the questions asked by police and done the same with her client's answers `` It is very different when I'm conversing with a hearing client. You can convey certain ideas with tones and inflections. I leave an interview with him not feeling satisfied that I communicated with him,'' she said. If the case goes to trial, it could be a logistical nightmare to make sure the defendants understand what is happening in the courtroom. Ms. <PERSON> Jenkins </PERSON>, the public defender has suggested using computer terminals to print out questions and answers for the defendants. `` It's the only way I can see where he would get a fair trial,'' she said.

<HEAD>Most Democratic Defectors Are Current or Former Local Officials</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Three times last week, the Republicans gloated and the Democrats winced as President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> welcomed Democratic defectors into the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> fold. The White House doors were opened wide to showcase two of the coups. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> personally extended a fraternal hand to retiring <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> Chief <PERSON> Maurice </PERSON> <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> _ widely considered a mayoral prospect for the capital _ and to Rep. <PERSON> Tommy </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION>, a potential gubernatorial candidate. In the third case, the president telephoned <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> Secretary of <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <PERSON> Fox </PERSON> <PERSON> McKeithen </PERSON> and congratulated him on joining the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> while <PERSON> McKeithen </PERSON>'s father, the former eight-year Democratic Gov. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> McKeithen </PERSON> told his son, `` You must be crazy.'' <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> and <PERSON> McKeithen </PERSON> were the latest in a raft of southern officials who have deserted their traditional Democratic roots for the party that has won five of the last six presidential elections. The defectors' stated reasons for changing parties are a desire to align themselves with the tough-on-crime, pro-defense thrust of the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and the domestic agenda lumped under the `` family values'' category. They describe the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> as liberal, special-interest oriented and not representative of their constituencies. Some southern switchers said they became Republicans for political survival after witnessing the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> voting strength in recent elections. <PERSON> Turner </PERSON>, who has not dampened speculation about a mayoral bid, gave reasons designed to sell well with the city's overwhelming majority of black and Democratic voters. The former chief, who is black, cited <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s `` kinder-gentler'' effort, his anti-crime and anti-drug campaign, and his bid to project concern about civil rights and minority entrepreneurship. <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> native whose expertise in southern politics is widely acknowledged, is embarked on a campaign to demonstrate to potential party switchers that their constituents' allegiance is really to the GOP. While Democrats control all of the south's state legislatures, Republicans now sit in five out of 11 governor's chairs. The Democrats say on the one hand that the party-switching trend is overblown, that the Republicans have attracted only two statewide officials and two members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> _ <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> and Rep. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Grant </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. Most of the 130 party switchers touted by the <ORGANIZATION> RNC </ORGANIZATION> are current or former local officials such as aldermen, committee members, judges, sheriffs and school board members. Some two dozen state legislators are among the switchers. Still, the Democrats are not ignoring the trend, especially with the symbolic value the Republicans gain by using the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> to announce the switches. <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>'s congressional colleagues from <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION>, Democratic Reps. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> and <PERSON> Beryl </PERSON> <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> branded him a `` cagey politician'' who was `` snaking'' behind their backs for years. Democrats accused <PERSON> McKeithen </PERSON> of making deal with the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> to pay off his $ 400,000 campaign debt. <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> was accused positioning himself politically against a hefty field of potential Democratic mayoral candidates, including incumbent Mayor <PERSON> Marion </PERSON> <PERSON> Barry </PERSON>, and, perhaps, <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> has a twofold approach against further defections: threatening to defeat the officeholders who switch by recruiting Democrats to run against them, and touring the South to shore up their traditional support. `` We'd like to give powerful incentives for these people not to switch, for example, promising to beat them if they do,'' said <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> McCurry </PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. He said national <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> staffers have fanned out to the districts of the deserters to seek rival candidates for forthcoming elections. But the Democrats are aware of a growing perception that the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> is on a roll while `` people somehow feel that values of the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> are out of sync with their community,'' <PERSON> McCurry </PERSON> acknowledged. `` That's a failure on the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> to project ... an image of forcefulness about what we care about and some sense of where we would lead the country in the future.'' `` It is very clear that this party has got to reach out and tell people what it cares about.. what we think <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> is all about and what <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> should be in the next century,'' <PERSON> McCurry </PERSON> said Thus, while <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> and <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> were shaking the president's hand before a battery of cameras last week, <ORGANIZATION> DNC </ORGANIZATION> chairman <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> was in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> meeting with local party officials The <ORGANIZATION> DNC </ORGANIZATION> has calculated that <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> spends about half his time traveling out of the capital, and 40 percent of that time is in the South. The Democrats contend that party switching is cheating the voters who elected Democrats. The Republicans, said <PERSON> McCurry </PERSON>, are `` making up for their inability to go out and win elections ... fair and square.'' But while the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> circulates its list of 130 party-switchers, <PERSON> McCurry </PERSON> would point to only one on the Democratic scorecard _ a former member of the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> legislature, attorney <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON>, who is said to be considering a gubernatorial bid.

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Wojciech </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON> resigned today as head of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and was replaced by the outgoing prime minister, a politician who has become a champion of hard-line forces in the party. The moves came at a two-day <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> plenum called to debate the future of the party, which has been deeply divided by policy disputes and parliamentary elections in which many of its candidates were trounced. The plenum also dropped five of the 18 Politburo members and three of the nine party secretaries, the official news agency <ORGANIZATION> PAP </ORGANIZATION> announced. <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON>, who had led the party since 1981, promised to give up his post as party chief before the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> narrowly elected him to the new office of president on July 19. But some observers were surprised that the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> elected outgoing Prime Minister <PERSON> Mieczyslaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Rakowski </PERSON> by a 4-1 margin to replace <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON> as party leader. The selection of the 62-year-old <PERSON> Rakowski </PERSON> culminated a remarkable political rise by an official who only joined the Politburo in December 1987 after having been dropped from the government in 1985. In recent months <PERSON> Rakowski </PERSON> has been roundly criticized for his government's handling of the economy. A party member with a long reputation as a reformer, in the past year <PERSON> Rakowski </PERSON> has become the champion of hard-line elements in the party and those concerned about the rising influence of Solidarity. Earlier today, <PERSON> Rakowski </PERSON>'s government came under renewed criticism for its economic performance. Inflation has climbed into triple digits and basic goods such as meat, bread and sugar have been in short supply in recent weeks. A plan by <PERSON> Rakowski </PERSON> to sharply raise food prices Aug. 1 has been criticized as not properly prepared. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> accepted with one abstention the resignation of <PERSON> Wojciech </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON> from the office of first secretary,'' <ORGANIZATION> PAP </ORGANIZATION> said. Moments later, the plenum elected <PERSON> Rakowski </PERSON> 171 to 41, <ORGANIZATION> PAP </ORGANIZATION> said. The only remaining question facing the plenum, which began Friday, appeared to be who will replace <PERSON> Rakowski </PERSON> as prime minister. Potential candidates appeared to be Politburo member <PERSON> Wladyslaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Baka </PERSON>, <PERSON> Ireneusz </PERSON> <PERSON> Sekula </PERSON>, now deputy prime minister and a <PERSON> Rakowski </PERSON> loyalist, or <PERSON> Roman </PERSON> <PERSON> Malinowski </PERSON>, the leader of the allied <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peasant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON> hinted at the plenum Friday that he would not hold the party leadership much longer and said a full congress of the 2-million-member party should be held soon. `` I am standing before you still, for the moment, in a double role,'' said <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON>, referring to his election as president. He challenged fellow Communists to decide `` what we stand for.'' <ORGANIZATION> PAP </ORGANIZATION> said the plenum today adopted a resolution declaring the party's willingness to work with the independent Solidarity trade union movement and with the 260 Solidarity lawmakers chosen by the voters in June. As a result of the country's most democratic elections since World War II, the formerly banned Solidarity now controls 99 out of 100 seats in the new freely elected <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and 161 of the 460 seats in the Sejm, or parliament. Many party-backed candidates suffered humiliating defeats in the election. The resolution reaffirmed the party's January decision to legalize Solidarity and `` defined conditions'' needed to improve the economy, <ORGANIZATION> PAP </ORGANIZATION> said, without elaborating. Earlier today, the party <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> information policy director, <PERSON> Slawomir </PERSON> <PERSON> Tabkowski </PERSON>, told the plenum the party is changing too quickly for more doctrinaire members, <ORGANIZATION> PAP </ORGANIZATION> said. `` The speaker said possibilities should be created for those who are disappointed with the party ... and those who do not identify with the direction of changes to leave,'' <ORGANIZATION> PAP </ORGANIZATION> said. But <PERSON> Jerzy </PERSON> <PERSON> Majka </PERSON>, the editor of the generally hard-line party daily <ORGANIZATION> Trybuna </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ludu </ORGANIZATION>, said recent talk about the party's future is `` unsettling to all people, not only party members,'' according to <ORGANIZATION> PAP </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Majka </PERSON> said the party must maintain its `` rational'' approach in trying to solve <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s problems. The discussion included sharp criticism of the party's performance in the elections and of the government's handling of the economy In another development, Politburo member <PERSON> Wladyslaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Baka </PERSON> quit as party secretary in charge of the economy after delivering a speech criticizing <PERSON> Rakowski </PERSON>'s administration. <PERSON> Rakowski </PERSON> handed in his government's resignation when the new Parliament was seated. <PERSON> Baka </PERSON> was considered a likely candidate to succeed <PERSON> Rakowski </PERSON> as prime minister.

<HEAD>Deng Says He Does Not Approve of `Great Democracy'</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Senior leader <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaoping </PERSON> said in an essay publicized Saturday that he does not approve of `` great democracy'' but that `` small democracy'' is needed to keep in touch with the masses. Allowing the masses to supervise the rulers `` is better than not having supervision,'' wrote the 84-year-old <PERSON> Deng </PERSON>, who has crushed three populist democracy movements in his decade of rule. The last time was in June, when he ordered an army attack on student protesters. `` If we do n't accept supervision and expand the democratic life of the party and country, we will be divorced from the masses and commit great errors,'' <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> wrote in the essay summarized on the television evening news. The report said the essay would appear in the next issue of the magazine Party Building. <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> added, `` We do not approve of great democracy. Great democracy is avoidable, and this requires having small democracy.'' He did not explain what he meant by the terms, but `` great democracy'' appeared to be a reference to the kind of unfettered debate that <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> denounced in the recent student protests as leading to anarchy. In past writings, he also has rejected Western-style parliamentary democracy as bourgeois. By small democracy, he apparently was referring to controlled expressions of opinion that do not challenge the power of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. He wrote that the party should be supervised by the masses and by the eight officially approved non-Communist parties that are permitted to exist. Most important, the party must police itself, he said. `` Whether or not the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> is qualified to lead depends on our party itself ... on our party's ideology and work style,'' he wrote. The party, meanwhile, announced it was issuing a new book called `` Deng Xiaoping Over 28 Years,'' written by his colleagues and commemorating his `` glorious and outstanding achievements.'' Publication of the essay and the book were part of a new high profile, tinged with adulation, for the aging leader, who had been in semi-retirement. He re-emerged to lead the June crackdown on the student protesters, and since then a series of books and a movie about him have appeared. His name appears in newspaper headlines daily, and millions of Chinese nationwide are being required to study a speech he made on crushing the student `` rebellion.'' <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> said in the past that he did not want the mass adulation revolutionary leader <PERSON> Mao </PERSON> <PERSON> Tse-tung </PERSON> received in his last years. The current campaign of Dengist admiration falls far short of that, but many Chinese have begun drawing a parallel. <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> had been expected to retire from his last official posts, as head of the state and party military affairs commissions, later this year. But Western diplomats say they consider that unlikely given the army's new prominence and power. In other developments, Premier <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Peng </PERSON> told a <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> newspaper publisher <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> is willing to maintain good relations with <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> despite `` recent difficulties'' but that the future of relations `` depends on the French side.'' The official <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Li </PERSON> spoke in a meeting with <PERSON> Yang </PERSON> <PERSON> Yongju </PERSON>, publisher of <ORGANIZATION> Europe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> froze its relations with <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> to protest the crackdown on the protesters, and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> since has protested that <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> gave refuge to some fugitive student and intellectual leaders.

 <ORGANIZATION> Amoco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> has signed an agreement to explore for oil in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, according to a published report. Under the contract, signed Friday in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Amoco </ORGANIZATION> and the state-owned Polish Oil and <ORGANIZATION> Gas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> will conduct a 12-month joint study of geological and geophysical data on roughly 40 percent of the country, the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION> reported Saturday.

But the potential for oil is indicated by <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s abundance of coal _ the two hydrocarbons are often found in proximity to one another. <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> has n't explored intensively for oil for at least 45 years, and thus may have missed deposits detectable with today's sophisticated equipment, said <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Munk </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Amoco </ORGANIZATION>'s manager of foreign affairs `` It's a problem of technical capabilities and money,'' said <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Szczurowski </PERSON>, the economic attache at the Polish commercial consular's office in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>.

 <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> staged a token withdrawal of 600 soldiers Saturday and opened negotiations with <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION> on the departure of the rest of its 45,000-man force sent to quell ethnic violence. President <PERSON> Ranasinghe </PERSON> <PERSON> Premadasa </PERSON>, who had demanded the removal of `` the last Indian soldier'' by the end of July, sought to portray Saturday's hastily arranged withdrawal as a victory for his government. But the action seemed likely to be viewed as too little and too late to stop escalating assassinations and attacks on <PERSON> Premadasa </PERSON>'s government by ultranationalist members of the Sinhalese majority ethnic group The radicals oppose an Indian-brokered peace plan to grant limited autonomy to minority Tamils in the north and east of this island off <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s southern coast. Indian peacekeeping forces, initially numbering barely 2,000, arrived in <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION> on July 30, 1987, to supervise the surrender of arms by Tamil guerrillas under terms of the accord. But the largest Tamil militant group reneged on the agreement. The Indian force swelled at one point to a peak of at least 70,000 men who bogged down in their own jungle war with Tamil rebels. Both Indian and Sri Lankan officials said they did not know when more Indian troops would leave. Sri Lankan and Indian teams began three days of talks in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION> on Saturday on the issue. Indian <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Aftab </PERSON> <PERSON> Seth </PERSON> said the talks `` have so far been successful.'' He did not elaborate. The departing camouflage-clad Indian soldiers strode aboard the Indian troop carrier <PERSON> Magar </PERSON>, carrying only their rifles. Some said they were told of their departure only a few hours in advance. `` About 600 are leaving today,'' Gen. <PERSON> Amarjit </PERSON> <PERSON> Kalkat </PERSON>, commander of the Indian peacekeeping force, told reporters at the harbor in <LOCATION> Trincomalee </LOCATION>, about 145 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION>. The <PERSON> Magar </PERSON>, whose Hindi name means crocodile, left <LOCATION> Trincomalee </LOCATION> on Saturday night, <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>'s state-run radio station reported. It was expected to reach the <LOCATION> Indian </LOCATION> port of <LOCATION> Madras </LOCATION>, 315 miles north, on Sunday. Gen. <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON> <PERSON> Wanasinghe </PERSON>, commander of the Sri Lankan army whose troops in <LOCATION> Trincomalee </LOCATION> and the rest of the <LOCATION> northeast </LOCATION> have been confined to their camps since the Indians arrived, said: `` This is a token gesture and the rest will follow.'' The Tamil separatist war started in 1983 with attacks on Sri Lankan troops and massacres of Sinhalese civilians. <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, the region's biggest military power, had provided sanctuary for Tamil fighters and got drawn into the political fray by the sympathies of its own Tamil minority of 60 million for their Sri Lankan brethren. But when the Indians tried to disarm the Sri Lankan Tamils, they became the enemy. About 1,000 Indian soldiers are among the 11,000 people who have died in the insurrection in the past six years. Despite the small number of troops who boarded the Indian ship Saturday, the Sri Lankan government professed optimism that more soon would follow. `` It is a commencement,'' said Gen. <PERSON> Sepala </PERSON> <PERSON> Attygalle </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>'s defense secretary, who flew to <LOCATION> Trincomalee </LOCATION> to watch the departure. Asked whether he thought Saturday's withdrawal would pacify Sinhalese extremists, <PERSON> Attygalle </PERSON> said: `` I am hopeful that there will be a lessening of that sort of violence.'' The government accuses Sinhalese extremists of 4,000 killings, mostly of Sinhalese government officials and their supporters, since the first Indian troops arrived. On Friday, <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>'s state-run television said <PERSON> Premadasa </PERSON>'s troops shot and killed at least 74 people who violated a nationwide curfew to denounce the Indian presence and the Sri Lankan government But Foreign Minister <PERSON> Ranjan </PERSON> <PERSON> Wijeratne </PERSON>, just before leaving <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION> for the talks in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION>, said the actual death toll may have been 100 to 150. He said most killed were Sinhalese radicals. The curfew, imposed at midnight Thursday, was to remain in effect until 6 a.m. Sunday. The government said it would be imposed again indefinitely starting at 6 p.m. Sunday. The curfew is designed to thwart protests and attacks by Sinhalese extremists during the second anniversary of the 1987 peace accord. The accord offered a measure of autonomy to Tamils in the northeast. So far a Tamil-dominated provincial council has been elected but has yet to assume any real powers. Tamils, mostly Hindu, comprise 18 percent of <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>'s 16 million people, but they are the majority in the northeast. Sinhalese, who are mostly Buddhists, account for 75 percent.

 Counterfeiting used to be a skilled craft, but one recent case illustrates the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> agent's greatest fear: that new photocopy technology makes it possible for just about anyone to produce fake money <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> McCoy </PERSON>, who was convicted last week in an operation that made $ 800,000 worth of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Canadian currency, did it with a high-tech <ORGANIZATION> Canon </ORGANIZATION> Color Laser Copier. It was one of the first, if not the first case of the latest in laser copying equipment being used to counterfeit money, said <PERSON> Hunter </PERSON> <PERSON> Howerton </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Secret </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> agent in <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION>. `` At one time, counterfeiting was very specialized. It was like an art,'' <PERSON> Howerton </PERSON> said. `` Printing used to be a very respected tradition _ <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON> <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> was a printer. ... `` Now, all you have to be able to do is press a button.'' <PERSON> McCoy </PERSON>'s $ 20, $ 50 and $ 100 bills looked fine on first inspection, but experts can easily distinguish a photocopied bill. Tiny stars on the treasury seal came out as circles, and the backgrounds behind portraits of <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, <PERSON> Grant </PERSON> and <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> were washed out instead of salt-and-peppered, said <ORGANIZATION> Secret </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> Agent Art <PERSON> Dalton </PERSON>. The paper was different, too, missing the red and blue fibers woven into real bills. Under a microscope, the difference is obvious to an expert. Letters printed with real plates are raised from the paper's surface and sharp-edged, while photocopied letters are flat and fuzzy at the edges `` They're good, but they're not that good,'' said <PERSON> Dalton </PERSON>, who heads the <ORGANIZATION> Charleston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Secret </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> office. <ORGANIZATION> Canon </ORGANIZATION> introduced its first color copier in the 1970s and advanced it with the use of lasers in 1987. The copiers are sold mostly to print shops and advertising agencies whose customers demand color copies of everything from photos and art work to documents. <PERSON> McCoy </PERSON> got his by talking the owner of a truck parts store into buying him one for $ 35,000. In return, <PERSON> McCoy </PERSON> offered to split the profit. Manufacturers worry that their copiers could be put to illegal use, but there is little they can do but warn customers and suggest that they control access to the most sophisticated machines, said <PERSON> Hajime </PERSON> <PERSON> Hirai </PERSON>, a spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> Canon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` We're doing our best, but it's very difficult,'' <PERSON> Hirai </PERSON> said. <PERSON> McCoy </PERSON>, 43, of Slaters Branch, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>, was convicted July 24 in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Huntington </LOCATION> of counterfeiting, and could be sentenced to a maximum of 20 years in prison and fined $ 500,000. The counterfeiting scheme was broken up when three accomplices were caught and turned <PERSON> McCoy </PERSON> in. In a separate case, <PERSON> McCoy </PERSON> was convicted in June of bank robbery and killing a federal witness. The government already has talked to <ORGANIZATION> Canon </ORGANIZATION> officials about compiling a list of color copier owners, <PERSON> Hirai </PERSON> said, but the company says it ca n't and should n't. `` We do n't have any legal responsibilities to keep records on our customers. And a lot of times, dealers do n't want to disclose their customers' names. Their customers want things kept confidential.'' There already is talk of changing the design of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> currency. Canadian, French and British currency are hard to reproduce either because of colors used or because the paper contains a magnetic strip. But some people say the crooks will always find a way to get around changes. `` You could make an invisible marking on a bill that can be seen by a copier, but it does n't matter,'' <PERSON> Hirai </PERSON> said. `` The counterfeiters, they'll just think of another way.''

<TEXT>
 Justice of the Peace <PERSON> Agapito </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> keeps the civil docket book on a chair near the pool table and hears cases between posters of bikini-clad women and bags of potato and corn chips. The courtroom philosophy hangs on a sign: `` A man's got to believe in something. I believe I'll have another beer.'' It's cantina justice at the <ORGANIZATION> G </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; G bar, where <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> has been holding court at the family-owned business since 1966. Defendants are free to stick around for a cold one. `` They stick around, they drink beer and all that,'' said the 75-year-old JP. `` Sometimes they phone me. They want to come and get married here and I married them here.'' `` They want to give me a tip, but it is not acceptable. You can not give any tip to justices. It is against the law, not even a gift.'' Near trophies and antlers and an old eight-track tape deck, cowboys drink and listen to Mexican music on a juke box. The aroma of burning mesquite and sizzling meat blows in from the back porch. The G & amp; G offers free barbecue and sells its beer and chips. <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> calls his son from behind the bar to bring the docket to his bench, an aging chrome dinette set. `` He's the law west of Highway 281,'' joked County Clerk <PERSON> Arnoldo </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON>, leaning on the bar. He's a regular at the G & amp; G and a nephew of the JP. `` It used to be pretty bad around here, knifings. The last 10 years it has mellowed.'' Constable <PERSON> Bartolo </PERSON> <PERSON> Guajardo </PERSON> says he ca n't remember the last murder in <LOCATION> Jim </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Wells </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Precinct 6, in deep south <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> about 50 miles from the <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. `` People are friendly here because we are all related,'' <PERSON> Agapito </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> said. The G & amp; G is one of a few buildings at the center of <PERSON> Palito </PERSON> <PERSON> Blanco </PERSON>, named after the native hackberry trees with bumpy, whitish bark. The town of 300 is surrounded by ranches, farms and miles of barbed wire. <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> deals mostly with speeding tickets, poaching and tenant-landlord disputes. A <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> justice of the peace is a locally elected court officer. A JP can perform marriages, issue death certificates, and, especially in rural areas, issue criminal warrants and conduct bond hearings. <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> hears jury trials at the schoolhouse, but that is n't very often His last jury case was two years ago. The JP, known for light fines and mercy, still worries the jury was too harsh. `` It was a speeding case, a fellow driving 100 miles an hour,'' <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> recalled. `` He lose the case. They charge him a little over $ 100, the jury. ... It was n't fair, because I asked them to give him a break, because he was a young boy, he looked like being a very nice boy. `` There is no rich people here in <LOCATION> Palito </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Blanco </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> said. `` People here are all very poor. They do n't have money. They work for their living. Most of them get a little less than $ 100 a week and you ca n't live now with $ 100 a week.'' Even rich out-of-towners are likely to get off easy, the JP says. Highway patrolmen, he complains, do not give enough warnings. <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON>, who plans to retire next year, worries about the retirees who get speeding tickets on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> 281 on their way south for the winter. `` I try to give them a break, because they are old people like me and sometimes they are not driving as fast as -LRB- the officer -RRB- said,'' <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> said. And then there's the story about the <LOCATION> Lubbock </LOCATION> banker caught poaching deer on a nearby ranch. <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> gave him the minimum fine. Then he talked the game wardens into tying the deer onto the banker's car.

 A truck driver for a security company disappeared with $ 2.7 million in cash when the guards in the truck got out to pick up more cash, police said Saturday. The robbery occurred Friday evening when the <LOCATION> Candi </LOCATION> security company's truck stopped in front of a pastry shop in north <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION> and two security guards got out to pick up money for delivery to a bank, a police spokesman said on condition of anonymity.

He said it contained 15 bags with 170,000 in cash, the driver's service revolver, and a 12-gauge shotgun. `` The guards still ca n't believe this has happened,'' the spokesman said. `` We're looking all over for the driver and the cash, but the whole thing still seems a mystery.''

<HEAD>Syrians And Christians Clash Across A Virtual Ghost City</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Syrian and <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> gunners battled with howitzers and rocket launchers Saturday over the ruins of a virtual ghost city, deserted by more than a million people fleeing fighting that has left hundreds dead. Police said eight people were killed and 42 wounded in overnight and morning exchanges across the divided capital, where 1.5 million people once lived. `` My city is dying. I'll die with it. I wo n't leave,'' <PERSON> Ihsan </PERSON> <PERSON> Salam </PERSON>, a retired civil servant, said with tears in his eyes. `` I'll stay here. If I have to die, I'll die in dignity in my apartment, in my bed. I do n't want to live as a refugee,'' said the 70-year-old Sunni Moslem who lives in west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Zasrif </LOCATION> district. The summer wind kicked up dust storms in the dirty streets, and cats chased rats across piles of stinking garbage littering the once-fashionable <LOCATION> Hamra </LOCATION> commercial thoroughfare. Banks, restaurants, stores and offices were closed, and the once swarming streets were almost deserted. Fires blazed out of control and palls of thick black smoke billowed from gaping holes in apartment buildings. <PERSON> Salam </PERSON> is among only about 250,000 people still living in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> after more than four months of almost daily artillery duels. Saturday's casualties raised the overall toll to 502 killed and 2,056 wounded in the 19-week confrontation between Christian army commander Gen. <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s troops and Syrian forces. The fighting erupted after <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> imposed a naval blockade on illegal ports run by Moslem militias south of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> in an effort to recover around $ 100 million annually in lost customs revenues. The Syrians joined the Moslem militias shelling the Christian enclave north of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> in retaliation and blocked its land entrances. The Syrians, who consider <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> within their sphere of influence, keep about 40,000 troops in predominantly Moslem areas under a 1976 Arab League mandate to end the civil war, now in its 15th year. A police spokesman, who can not be named in line with standing rules, said about half <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>'s population fled to safer areas in the first three months of clashes. About 350,000 others deserted the capital during the past 10 days during a devastating bombardment of residential districts, he said. Most evacuees headed to south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, the eastern <LOCATION> Bekaa </LOCATION> valley and summer resorts in mountains northeast of the capital. The thuds of exploding shells echoed across the wooded hills south of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> early in the day as Syrian army gunners pounded the Christian suburb of <LOCATION> Baabda </LOCATION> east of the capital. <LOCATION> Baabda </LOCATION> houses the presidential palace where <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> has his residence and headquarters. Several motorists, heading to <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> to inspect their deserted apartments and businesses, turned back to avoid being caught in cross fire. `` They're shelling his palace. He'll respond soon. I do n't want to be around when his response starts,'' said <PERSON> Marwan </PERSON> <PERSON> Shaar </PERSON>, a Sunni who owns a currency trading company. He was speaking in the Syrian-policed <LOCATION> Khaldeh </LOCATION> area, seven miles south of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. The area came under fierce shelling overnight by Christian gunners. The police spokesman said `` thousands'' of people were spending nights in cars on river banks and seaside boulevards in <LOCATION> south </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, because they could n't find accommodations or could n't afford sky-high rents Hundreds of children played in the <LOCATION> Awali </LOCATION> <LOCATION> river </LOCATION> just outside <LOCATION> Sidon </LOCATION>, 25 miles south of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. Their parents slept in cars or on mattresses and blankets on the river bank. `` At least it is safe here,'' said <PERSON> Samir </PERSON> <PERSON> Shatilla </PERSON>, a salesman for an appliance company in west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Shatilla </PERSON> said he was spending the nights with his wife and two sons in his old brown <LOCATION> Plymouth </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Chileans Show Little Interest in Constitutional Referendum</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By EDUARDO GALLARDO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 In an unprecedented show of unity, both the military government and its political foes are encouraging Chileans to approve democratic reforms of the constitution in a referendum Sunday. Most Chileans, however, have shown little interest in the vote, apparently believing the changes will pass even with a small turnout. Voting is mandatory, but government officials and opposition leaders still fear many of the 7.6 million registered voters will stay home. President <PERSON> Augusto </PERSON> <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> has sent all 16 of his Cabinet ministers on tours of provincial cities to explain the proposed reforms and ask people to vote. The head of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electoral </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON>, warned that those failing to vote will be prosecuted and may be fined $ 100. That's a lot of money in a country where about a third of the labor force earns the legal mimimum salary of $ 66 a month or less. The referendum asks Chileans to approve or reject as a package 54 changes in the 1980 constitution, which was written by the military. The changes include easing restrictions on Marxist activity, which has been banned. It dilutes the government's power in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> by increasing the number of seats from 36 to 48 and leaving the government-appointed bloc at nine. It also adds another civilian member to a powerful, military-dominated <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>. Other changes would eliminate the presidential power to send Chileans into exile and to dissolve the lower house of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. Requirements for future constitutional reform would be eased. Both the government and opposition agreed to the text of the proposed changes. Officials said the proposals were viewed as `` democratizing'' the constitution, although the opposition had repeatedly said they were insufficient. `` The constitution continues to be anti-democratic, but it's a first step which will allow us all to build together a really democratic institutional system,'' said <PERSON> Ricardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Lagos </PERSON>, a prominent Socialist leader. Constitutional experts and political leaders had said public apathy during the campaign stemmed from the widespread belief the proposed changes would be approved even with a small turnout. `` There's nothing dramatic about this referendum,'' said <PERSON> Edgardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Boeninger </PERSON>, vice president of the centrist <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, the largest in the opposition. `` There is no one to beat this time,'' he told The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. He also said Chileans had displayed little interest because they were ill informed and considered the changes very complex. Nearly all the major political parties and the government urged approval of the changes in 40-second television spots broadcast by all the country's stations. The spots were allocated at no charge to opposition parties. About the only controversy of the campaign broke out when the government censored at least 10 opposition television spots, claiming they were illegal. It said they were intended as party propaganda _ not to clarify the referendum. The country's last referendum was Oct. 5, and turnout was 97 percent. At issue was whether <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>'s rule should be extended until 1997. The extension was overwhelmingly rejected.

 <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>'s agony began nearly 20 years ago when pro-American generals ousted a neutralist prince. Since then, millions have been killed, made homeless or fled the killing field that their homeland has become. The 1970 coup against Cambodian leader Prince <PERSON> Norodom </PERSON> <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON> set off a cycle of national devastation that an international conference in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> is now trying to reverse. Under Gen. <PERSON> Lon </PERSON> <PERSON> Nol </PERSON>, the U.S.-backed coup leaders took on the communists of neighboring <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> and their <LOCATION> Cambodian </LOCATION> allies, the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>, in a five-year war. Some people called it a `` sideshow'' to the Vietnam War. But it killed an estimated 1 million people as ground troops engaged in fierce combat and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> launched one of the most intense aerial bombardments in history. On April 17, 1975, the black-clad <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> marched into the <LOCATION> Cambodian </LOCATION> capital and began to herd its 2 million people into the countryside at gunpoint. <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Year Zero'' had begun: society was to be totally cleansed and all resisters eliminated in the Southeast Asian nation. The most conservative estimates say hundreds of thousands were executed or died of diseases and hunger in <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> labor camps. The current <LOCATION> Cambodian </LOCATION> government claims 3.3 million died as leader <PERSON> Pol </PERSON> <PERSON> Pot </PERSON> turned on `` class enemies'' who included children, the handicapped, and anyone who spoke a foreign language. <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s 1978 invasion rid the country of the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> but spawned another conflict. From jungle bases along the Thai-Cambodian border, a three-party coalition led by <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON> mounted a guerrilla campaign against the Vietnamese and the new <LOCATION> Cambodian </LOCATION> government they had installed. The <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> formed part of the coalition. More than a quarter-million civilians remain in sprawling, vulnerable camps along the embattled frontier. Fighting in the interior and uncertainty about the future hampers development in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>, one of the world's poorest countries. With <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> promising to pull out its remaining forces in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> by the end of September, threats of more bloodshed looms. The powerful <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> could attempt a comeback and carry out another reign of terror.

 The nation's governors opened their annual conference Saturday with a call for more investment in transportation and a complaint that the federal government is hoarding money that should be spent on highways and airports. `` Unfortunately, when it comes to transportation, <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> is often stuck in neutral,'' said <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>'s Democratic Gov. <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Baliles </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Governors </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> planned to arrive Monday to address the governors. The governors' association sought to steer clear of partisanship during its meeting, which concludes Tuesday, and planned to focus on efforts to improve <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> performance in the international economy. The bipartisan association released a report saying improvements in transportation are essential for the nation to become more competitive with foreign industry. It warned that transportation facilities `` are deteriorating at a faster rate than they are being repaired or replaced.'' The report called for more regional and federal planning, increased use of tolls, developer fees and other user fees, and release of uncommitted balances in federal trust funds for highways, aviation, mass transit and waterways. At an opening news conference, <PERSON> Baliles </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> Republican Gov. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> charged that the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration and the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration before it have withheld billions of dollars from the states in highway and airport trust funds. They said the amounts sent to the state were restricted in order to count the reserves in the federal budget and make the federal debt appear smaller. `` Our view is that money represents tax dollars already paid by the people of this country, and they ought to be spent for the purpose for which they were collected, and not used to play games with the size of the budget deficit in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Baliles </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Baliles </PERSON> said as much as $ 19 billion was held in the two trust funds from money collected through the federal taxes on gasoline and airplane fares. <PERSON> Charilyn </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Cowan </PERSON>, director of capital resources for the governors' association staff, estimated as much as $ 13 billion of that amount has accumulated as an uncommitted cash surplus or is behing withheld from the states for various technical reasons. Transportation Secretary <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> will address the governors Monday, and <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> said he intended to ask <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> about the trust funds. <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> and other <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials have told the governors in the past that much of the money is already obligated for future spending on transportation projects. Snarled traffic and shipping delays caused by deteriorating transportation systems, the report said, add to the cost of doing business for American companies. `` The vitality of both transportation and commerce is now threatened by a pattern of underinvestment and neglect,'' said <PERSON> Baliles </PERSON>. `` Today, rather than being the pride of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, our transportation systems are becoming one of its limiting factors, restraining economic growth.'' The report was written by a task force of governors headed by <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON>, the conference host, who recently announced he would not seek a fifth term. <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON>'s task force cited estimates that $ 1 trillion to $ 3 trillion in spending will be required over the next 20 years to bring the nation's transportation infrastructure `` into reasonable condition.'' That would require annual outlays of $ 50 billion to $ 150 billion. The report cited state efforts to fill the gap left by reductions in federal spending on transportation. But it said states have been constrained by federal tax laws restricting use of tax-exempt bonds for public works. `` We need to find the political will for <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> to make the investment in our transportation infrastructure, an investment that will help keep the American marketplace at the center of the world's commerce,'' said <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON>. Democrats hold a 28 to 22 majority over Republicans among the 50 state governors, after picking up one seat in the 1988 election. The full group planned to consider a resolution, already approved by its executive committee, urging action to reduce the federal deficit while protecting `` safety net'' social programs and avoiding a tax increase `` if possible.'' It advocates `` a selective freeze'' on defense and domestic spending. The abortion issue was not on the governors' agenda but was expected to be discussed privately. The meeting is the first bipartisan gathering of governors since the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>'s recent decision permitting states greater leeway in regulating abortions. At least one group, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Abortion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION>, which supports a woman's right to have an abortion, said it had obtained a police permit for a small demonstration Sunday. By prior agreement, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>'s Republican Gov. <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Branstad </PERSON> is to become chairman of the governors association at the end of the meeting, succeeding <PERSON> Baliles </PERSON>, who who leaves office as governor at the end of this year.

<HEAD>Highway Shootout as Bandits Seek Payoff</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Police disguised as relatives of a kidnapped businessman killed two bandits in a highway shootout Saturday after tricking the kidnappers into thinking they were on the trail of $ 3.7 million in ransom. Following the shooting, police combed the coutryside outside <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> in search of the victim, <PERSON> Dante </PERSON> <PERSON> Belardinelli </PERSON>, whose Jolly Caffe business distributes coffee and other food products. The shootout, which also left two bandits and four policemen wounded, occurred a day before a deadline set by <PERSON> Belardinelli </PERSON>'s kidnappers Slices of both his ears were found in an envelope in a bar July 23 in <LOCATION> Bologna </LOCATION>, along with a photo of <PERSON> Belardinelli </PERSON> after his ear lobes were cut off and a demand for ransom money, reportedly $ 3.7 million. They said if the money was not paid July 30, <PERSON> Belardinelli </PERSON>, 65, would be killed. He was kidnapped May 30 as he drove to his home in the hills outside <LOCATION> Florence </LOCATION>. In their demand, the kidnappers told <PERSON> Belardinelli </PERSON>'s daughter to drive up and down the highway from <LOCATION> Arezzo </LOCATION> in central <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Reggio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Calabria </LOCATION> in the south, a distance of about 600 miles, with the ransom until the bandits caught up with her and gave her a signal. The daughter was told to drive a Fiat 126 with a chair mounted on a roof luggage rack. Italian television and new agency reports said a <LOCATION> Florence </LOCATION> investigating magistrate decided it was too dangerous for <PERSON> Belardinelli </PERSON>'s daughter to drive the car. SWAT team police, chosen for their resemblance to the daughter and two other relatives, instead got in the Fiat and began driving, authorities said. When the <ORGANIZATION> Fiat </ORGANIZATION> was on the highway outside <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>, a bigger car with four people inside pulled up to it. When the bandits realized they had been tricked, they opened fire with a pistol and sawed-off shotguns, and the police fired back, the <ORGANIZATION> ANSA </ORGANIZATION> news agency reported. Two of the four bandits were killed and the other two were wounded and captured. One of the police officers was in a coma, <ORGANIZATION> ANSA </ORGANIZATION> said. A second car, also believed to hold bandits, sped away, the reports said. <ORGANIZATION> ANSA </ORGANIZATION> said the four bandits had been linked to previous kidnappings. It quoted the <LOCATION> Florence </LOCATION> magistrate, <PERSON> Pierluigi </PERSON> <PERSON> Vigna </PERSON>, as saying the police did not have any ransom money with them.

<DATELINE>KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A barrage of rockets fired by Moslem guerrillas slammed into <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> on Saturday, with one spraying shrapnel and glass around a crowded bazaar. At least 14 people were killed in the attacks, official <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kabul </ORGANIZATION> said. <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Nabi </PERSON> <PERSON> Amani </PERSON> said the U.S.-backed guerrillas are stepping up such attacks to give them more leverage before Monday's U.S.-Soviet talks on <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Stockholm </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>. The Soviets, who fought alongside Afghan government troops for nine years, are the Marxist government's major arms supplier. <PERSON> Amani </PERSON> said 12 people were killed Saturday. He said eight people died and 40 were injured when the rocket hit the bazaar. Other rockets landed around the center and south of the capital, killing four people and injuring 16, he said. Official Radio <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> said 14 people were killed and 50 injured in the attacks. The broadcast was monitored in <LOCATION> Islamabad </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>. Diplomatic sources speaking on condition of anonymity said they counted 30 rockets fired Saturday. In the past month, the rebels, who call themselves <ORGANIZATION> Mujahedeen </ORGANIZATION> or Islamic holy warriors, have been launching long-range rockets from behind the hills that ring this mile-high capital. More than 200 people have died, virtually all civilians. <PERSON> Abdul </PERSON> <PERSON> Halim </PERSON>, a 50-year-old school employee who suffered shrapnel wounds, said he was walking across the street when the rocket exploded at the <LOCATION> Kote </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sangi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bazaar </LOCATION> in western <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>. `` Whoever fired the rocket, they are anti-Moslem,'' he said. `` People are killed from this action, and I want it to stop,'' said a student at the bazaar who identified himself only as <PERSON> Najibullah </PERSON>. At the hospital where many victims were taken, bloody stretchers sat abandoned in the corridor. A knot of men and women scanned a list of names of victims. Dr. <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Nasser </PERSON>, who refused to give his first name, said three children were among the dead there. Standing in a ward surrounded by moaning survivors, <PERSON> Nasser </PERSON> denounced both the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the Soviets. `` The Afghan people do n't like the <ORGANIZATION> U.S.S.R. </ORGANIZATION> and the <LOCATION> U.S.A. </LOCATION> because the people think the <LOCATION> U.S.S.R. </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> U.S.A. </LOCATION> want war in our country,'' he said. `` Afghans want <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> for the Afghans.'' Another doctor pointed to his white jacket and said: `` All of us are wearing coats of peace because we want peace _ no more revolution.'' A third doctor, still wearing his operating room mask, added: `` This does n't mean we do n't want good relations with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> or the <ORGANIZATION> U.S.S.R. </ORGANIZATION> because we need their help, but we want our country back.'' Other doctors and nurses nodded in approval. In the ward, weeping relatives leaned over beds of the injured, and one man lunged for a doctor, shouting in anger. He was restrained and led out. The guerrillas are fighting to set up an Islamic republic in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. The war began after a 1978 coup that set up a Marxist government in the country.

<HEAD>Hungary's Communist Party No Longer Advocates Atheism</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 In a major policy change regarding religion, the <ORGANIZATION> Hungarian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> announced Saturday that it will no longer require members to be atheists and that it will stop meddling in church affairs. The changes were approved Friday by the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> and announced Saturday in a communique carried by the official <ORGANIZATION> MTI </ORGANIZATION> news agency. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Hungarian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> is not an atheist party but a party committed to the cause of social progress,'' <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> member <PERSON> Janos </PERSON> <PERSON> Berecz </PERSON> said Friday after the committee met in <LOCATION> Budapest </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Berecz </PERSON>, who presented the meeting with a report he helped prepare on religion, told reporters the party will now be open to people with religious convictions and that it will ensure separation of church and state. Recently, the party abolished the <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION>, which supervised and often interfered with organized religion. Speaking at a news conference, <PERSON> Berecz </PERSON> `` emphasized the need of abandoning the inflexible rules and guaranteeing freedom of conscience within the party,'' <ORGANIZATION> MTI </ORGANIZATION> reported. He said the party's bylaws will be modified to reflect the changes in policy the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> has approved There are no official statistics on church membership in <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, but 70 percent of Hungarian Christians are believed to be Roman Catholics, although a large number of them do not regularly attend church. In the past, some party members were known to have been Catholics, but they rarely dared to profess their beliefs in public. `` Making the free exercise of religion complete, the dialogue between Marxists and the faithful should continue on the highest level,'' <PERSON> Berecz </PERSON> said. Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> plans to visit <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> for the first time in 1991, and diplomatic relations with the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> may be re-established soon. The dramatic police changes may be an attempt by the party to polish up its image prior to next year's first multiparty elections in <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> since 1948. Party leaders decided Friday to hold the party's congress Oct. 6, a day earlier than originally scheduled. The goal of the meeting is to unite divided party members and chart winning policies for the 1990 elections.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON>'s campaign for a fifth mayoral term was considered a breeze until <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Conyers </PERSON> unexpectedly entered the race last week. The 13-term congressman lacks the local political organization and estimated $ 5 million in campaign funds that <PERSON> Young </PERSON> has, but <PERSON> Conyers </PERSON> is well-known and liked in <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>. Early polls show him running tight with <PERSON> Young </PERSON>, and the two dominating the Sept. 12 non-partisan primary in which 13 candidates will be winnowed to two. `` It could very well be,'' a close race, <PERSON> Young </PERSON> said late last week. `` I do n't expect any race to be easy.'' That was a sharp contrast to <PERSON> Young </PERSON>'s earlier statement about <PERSON> Conyers </PERSON>. `` Now that he's in, I will shoot at him like he's a rabbit.'' <PERSON> Wilbur </PERSON> <PERSON> Rich </PERSON>, a political science professor at <ORGANIZATION> Wayne </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> and author of a biography on Young, played down the significance of the polls. `` If -LRB- Conyers -RRB- survives the primary, then I think there will be a very tight and very bitter race. I think Conyers probably thinks <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> has something about his personality people do n't like and will try to build on that.'' Young, 71, defeated <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> accountant <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Barrow </PERSON> with 61 percent of the vote in 1985. Before <PERSON> Conyers </PERSON>, 60, entered the race, <PERSON> Barrow </PERSON> was the favorite to meet Young in November. `` <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> has got one good campaign left in him,'' <PERSON> Rich </PERSON> said. `` I think he will be more colorful, more flamboyant in his campaign rhetoric. I think he wants to show people he still wants to do the job.'' <PERSON> Barrow </PERSON> said he still thinks he will win the right to face <PERSON> Young </PERSON> again. Young, who has n't faced a real challenge since his first bid for mayor in 1973, has been under attack this year. Critics accuse him of failing to reverse the city's chronic crime and unemployment problems. On a more personal level, <PERSON> Young </PERSON> agreed earlier this year to pay child support following a highly publicized paternity suit in which blood tests confirmed he fathered the 6-year-old son of a former city employee. Even with a perception of <PERSON> Young </PERSON>'s vulnerability, <PERSON> Conyers </PERSON>' entry into the race baffled some observers who question why he would give up his seniority in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, where he is chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Government </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Operations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> watchdog panel. `` I am very puzzled,'' <PERSON> Rich </PERSON> said. `` He's been around a long time and could really do a lot of good for <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> in that position,'' in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Rich </PERSON> believes <PERSON> Conyers </PERSON> may be laying the groundwork for 1993, when <PERSON> Young </PERSON> is expected to step down. `` I think this is going to be a showcase for'93 ... the post-Young era,'' he said. How long <PERSON> Conyers </PERSON>' popularity will hold out is another question. `` I think <PERSON> John </PERSON> has always been a man of symbols, always engaged in symbolic events,'' <PERSON> Rich </PERSON> said, referring to <PERSON> Conyers </PERSON>' opposition to the Vietnam War, his involvement in former President <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>'s impeachment and his support of a holiday honoring the Rev. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Luther </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> `` Whatever his flaws are, they'll come out,'' <PERSON> Barrow </PERSON> said. City Council President <PERSON> Erma </PERSON> <PERSON> Henderson </PERSON> also could be a factor in the primary by siphoning support from <PERSON> Conyers </PERSON>, her longtime friend with whom she appeared arm-in-arm the day he filed his nominating petitions. <PERSON> Henderson </PERSON> said Friday she is in the race to stay. Most observers think <PERSON> Henderson </PERSON> and Barrow are preparing for 1993, when pop singer <PERSON> Stevie </PERSON> <PERSON> Wonder </PERSON>, an early Motown recording star, has said he wants to run for mayor. Two polls taken last week showed the extent of support for Young and <PERSON> Conyers </PERSON>. A Detroit Free Press-WXYZ-TV poll showed Young with 31 percent and <PERSON> Conyers </PERSON> with 27 percent of voter support in the primary. <PERSON> Barrow </PERSON> and <PERSON> Henderson </PERSON> trailed with 13 percent and 9 percent. In a <ORGANIZATION> Detroit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> poll, 44 percent said they would vote for <PERSON> Conyers </PERSON> in a runoff, while 43 percent would suppport Young. Both polls questioned 500 registered voters and were conducted Tuesday and Wednesday, after <PERSON> Conyers </PERSON> announced Monday.

 <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Root </PERSON>, who survived after his plane wandered 800 miles along the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> and crashed into the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION>, said Saturday he did not set out to kill himself, but briefly considered suicide waiting for rescue. `` It was at that moment that _ and only that moment _ that I ever stared the notion of suicide right in the face,'' <PERSON> Root </PERSON> said. `` It sent _ it was almost a jolt of electricity, right through me. The very thought running through my mind. ... I started swimming, swimming erratically and hard, and wasted energy in the process before I calmed myself down.'' Root made his comments in an interview broadcast Saturday by radio station WSWR. Root is an owner of the station in this north-central <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> community. <ORGANIZATION> WSWR </ORGANIZATION> reporter <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Norris </PERSON> said he interviewed Root Thursday at the home of Root's parents in <LOCATION> Plymouth </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, where he has been recovering from his injuries, which included an unexplained gunshot wound. Root, reached there Saturday morning by The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, declined to comment further. <PERSON> Norris </PERSON> said <PERSON> Root </PERSON> left <LOCATION> Plymouth </LOCATION> later Saturday headed for <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION> Root, 36, an <LOCATION> Alexandria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, communications lawyer, was en route from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> National </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Rocky </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, July 13 when he told air traffic controllers he was having trouble breathing. He put his plane on autopilot and military planes kept watch on him until his plane ran out of fuel and ditched near the <LOCATION> Bahamas </LOCATION>. Root said he was unconscious until the plane hit the water and did not know how he received a gunshot wound to the abdomen, which doctors noticed after his rescue. He checked out of a <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, hospital Monday. Root said pain and exhaustion almost overcame him while he fought to stay afloat until rescuers could arrive. `` I hurt an awful lot while I was swimming and I do n't know why. I knew I had a knot in my stomach. I knew it was very difficult to use my left arm,'' he said. He said reports since the crash _ including allegations of financial troubles and attacks on his credibility _ have shaken his faith in the media. `` In the week following my crash, I became some kind of a drug dealer and a gun smuggler. My law practice was taken apart,'' <PERSON> Root </PERSON> said. `` It seemed as though the media were beating the bushes for anybody in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> who wanted to take a potshot at me.'' Root was sued Thursday by a group of investors in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> who allege he cost them $ 125,000 in 1987 when he represented them in a bid to obtain a <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> license. The lawsuit accuses Root of legal malpractice. Military pilots who followed Root's <ORGANIZATION> Cessna </ORGANIZATION> 210 over the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> reported seeing the pilot slumped at the controls, but said his head and the plane's sun visor moved several times. Although blood tests for carbon monoxide were negative, <PERSON> Root </PERSON> said he believes a carbon dioxide buildup may have caused him to black out during the flight. He said a former <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> diver had described incidents in which carbon dioxide would build up in the lungs, leading to headaches and hard breathing and lapses of consciousness. `` You know something's wrong, but you do n't know what,'' he said. `` And when you do lapse into unconsciousness, it's a very troubled unconsciousness, and you're contstantly trying to pull yourself out. -LRB- It -RRB- sounded to me an awful lot like what I went through.'' Root said he was unaware he had been shot until doctors told him at the hospital. He has acknowledged keeping a loaded revolver in the plane's glove compartment. Root and his relatives speculated the .32 - caliber <ORGANIZATION> Smith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Wesson may have gone off on impact, a theory the manufacturer `` When I asked questions about it at <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Memorial </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>, the doctor suggested to me that if it had happened before impact, significantly before impact, he doubted that I would have had the strength to swim around for 15 minutes in the ocean till I got pulled out,'' Root said. <PERSON> Root </PERSON> said he has hired a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> lawyer primarily to quell `` the hysteria'' generated by the crash.

<HEAD>Byelorussians Debate Evacuation from Chernobyl Area</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Scientists say 106,000 people should be evacuated from their villages in <LOCATION> Byelorussia </LOCATION> due to contamination from the <LOCATION> Chernobyl </LOCATION> nuclear accident, not 11,000 as the government recommends, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said Saturday. Scientists and legislators speaking before the <LOCATION> Byelorussian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>'s legislature also said a broader program is needed to provide a normal life for people of the region, the official news agency reported. The cost of such a large resettlement would reach $ 15.6 billion, well beyond the finanical capabilities of the republic just north of the power plant, which is in the <LOCATION> Ukraine </LOCATION>. The estimate exceeds the $ 12.5 billion official figure for the cumulative cost of the Chernobyl cleanup. An explosion at the plant, the worst nuclear accident ever, scattered radiation across hundreds of miles. The accident killed 31 people, according to official accounts. `` Chernobyl is a disaster of the whole country, so the whole country must participate in curing the wounds,'' <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said in describing the arguments presented at the legislative session. It did not say when the meeting was held. The deputies, who were not identified, argued that over eight to 10 years, complete resettlement would be less expensive than trying to improve living conditions in the contaminated area. A Byelorussian parliamentary commission will consider the question, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. More than 130,000 people have been evacuated from homes in the immediate vicinity of <LOCATION> Chernobyl </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 Nearly 20 nations, including the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, begin an international conference Sunday aimed at ending a conflict in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> that the warring factions appear unable to resolve. After three days of meetings in preparation for the conference, the four Cambodian factions agreed only on seating arrangements for their representatives and on the quality of a catered lunch. Left for the international conference to tackle are the monitoring of <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s military pullout from <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>; the shape of an interim Cambodian government; and the future role of the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>, ousted from power after the Vietnamese invasion in 1978. On the eve of the meeting, Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> ruled out participation of <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> leaders in any future government. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> met for 3 -LCB- hours Saturday with Soviet Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>, one of dozens of pre-conference meetings scheduled between visiting officials. A Soviet spokesman, <PERSON> Vitaly </PERSON> <PERSON> Churkin </PERSON>, said there was `` a large area of common ground'' on <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>, and that both sides did not want to see the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> return to power. A senior <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official said both countries stressed the importance of a comprehensive solution, but still had differences on how it should work. As the delegates confer, the clock will be running in <LOCATION> Indochina </LOCATION>: <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> has reiterated that no matter what happens in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, it will withdraw its remaining forces by the end of September. This would leave the pro-Hanoi government in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> facing alone the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> and two non-communist allies on the battlefields. Those optimistic about peace point to two years of lower level talks and note a softening of positions by the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, which backs <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>, and by <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, the chief arms supplier to the Cambodian guerrillas. Pessimists say outside powers, pressing to end the war, may merely paper over differences and that the killing will continue. After prolonged wrangling, the four Cambodian factions agreed last week that <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> will be listed as a single entity at the conference but with four sub-delegations seated at the table. Sharp disagreement persisted on virtually every other issue. `` It's like a car that reaches the edge of an abyss and can not continue its journey,'' said Prime Minister <PERSON> Hun </PERSON> <PERSON> Sen </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> one day last week. The previous day, resistance leader Prince <PERSON> Norodom </PERSON> <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON> said he and <PERSON> Hun </PERSON> <PERSON> Sen </PERSON> had agreed on nothing except the excellence of the catered Cambodian lunch. <PERSON> Hun </PERSON> <PERSON> Sen </PERSON> rejects the idea of <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> participation in any interim government, saying it would try to grab power and launch another reign of terror. The communist ultras killed hundreds of thousands of Cambodians in a radical revolution before being ousted. <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON> is in uneasy alliance with the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> guerrillas, describing them as `` monsters'' but maintaining that excluding them from an interim government would increase chances for more fighting. A <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy paper for the conference said <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> would continue to support <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON> as the transition leader if he believed <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> `` elements, not leaders'' should have an interim role. <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON> and his allies favor a strong <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> presence to monitor the Vietnamese withdrawal, the disarming of the warring sides and the supervision of general elections. <PERSON> Hun </PERSON> <PERSON> Sen </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> oppose major <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> participation unless the <LOCATION> Cambodian </LOCATION> seat in the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>, now held by <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON>'s coalition, is vacated. <PERSON> Hun </PERSON> <PERSON> Sen </PERSON> and his Vietnamese backers separate the internal and international aspects of the Cambodian problem and say each can be dealt with separately. <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON> and his supporters, including non-Communist <LOCATION> Southeast </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, want a comprehensive solution. `` I do n't see prospects for an accord between <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hun </PERSON> <PERSON> Sen </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>,'' said <LOCATION> Southeast </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> expert <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Leifer </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> recently. `` I've come to the dismal conclusion that some kind of civil war is inevitable.'' A number of other western <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> scholars who met recently in <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> concurred, noting the increasingly confident <LOCATION> Cambodian </LOCATION> government has yet to test its military mettle against the guerrillas. And the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> particularly, these analysts say, is unlikely to concede anything at the negotiating table without first seeing how much it can gain on a battlefield vacated by <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s troop There are signs of give and take. <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, the key regional protagonists, have improved relations in recent months. <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>, through which arms flow to the guerrillas, has been a host to <PERSON> Hun </PERSON> <PERSON> Sen </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, eager to cut the drain of bankrolling <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s war machine, is reliably said to have put pressure on its ally to compromise. In apparent opposition to <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> has called for substantial <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> involvement. Current plans call for ministerial level talks to last until Tuesday, to be followed by meetings of several committees to focus on specific issues over several weeks before a final high-level session is convened. There will be 20 delegations. One will represent the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> secretary-general. <LOCATION> Zimbabwe </LOCATION> will attend as a representative of the non-aligned movement. <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> and 17 other nations account for the remaining delegations. In addition to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, other nations attending are <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Brunei </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION>, and co-hosts <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 A metropolis of tents will be <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>'s 18th largest city for eight days when 30,000 Boy Scouts set up camp for their National Jamboree. The gathering, which will include a high-tech video show as well as more traditional scouting activities like archery and flag-raising, begins Wednesday. `` The logistics of running an operation of this size _ it's quite an achievement in its own right,'' said <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Garland </PERSON>, director of public relations for the jamboree Fort A.P. <PERSON> Hill </PERSON>, outside <LOCATION> Fredericksburg </LOCATION>, has been the site for the last two jamborees and has been designated the permanent site for the gatherings that take place every four years. A 7,000-acre area at the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> fort will hold the tent city, which will have a population of 34,000, counting scouts, staff and volunteers. Workers have been busy for a year installing services, including a new water and sewer system, a bank, a 160-bed hospital, three post offices, and even a daily newspaper called The Jamboree Today. Food being trucked in includes 10 tons of butter, 20,000 heads of lettuce, 380,000 pints of milk, 90,000 hotdogs, 70,000 hamburgers, and a million cans of soft drinks. For the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, the Jamboree provides a potential logistical nightmare similar to a large-scale movement of troops. `` The Army is getting a chance to do the things they're trained to do, but they need a conflict to do it,'' said Jamboree Director <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON>. `` But this is n't a conflict; it's a happy association.'' For instance, getting participants together for two shows will require that the scouts be led out of their 20 subcamps at staggered times so they do n't all arrive at once. `` It's also a good image-builder for the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>.'' <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON> said. `` The kids will see the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> with a very positive attitude.'' The jamboree will kick off with an opening show arranged by movie director <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Spielberg </PERSON> and using two 30-by-40-foot video screens. <PERSON> Spielberg </PERSON> movie characters, including R2D2 and E.T., will be on hand, and the show will conclude with a 15-minute laser and fireworks display. For more traditional activities, there are three `` action centers'' _ an aquatics area, a conservation area, and a fishing lake stocked with about 20,000 fish. Scouts can try archery, air rifle target practice, bicycle motorcross, a physical fitness course, volleyball, flag raising, and a `` slippery'' tug-of-war, complete with soapy water. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> will have an exhibit, including a model of the space shuttle. The Boy Scouts of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> have held a national jamboree almost every four years since the first one in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, in 1937. The World Organization of the <ORGANIZATION> Scout </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION> holds a world jamboree every four years. The last one was held in <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> in 1988-89.

<TEXT>
 The selection of <PERSON> Mieczyslaw </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rakowski </PERSON> to lead <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> through an era of political upheaval culminates the remarkable comeback of a man ousted from government in 1985. <PERSON> Rakowski </PERSON>, chosen Saturday by a divided <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, only joined the party's ruling Politburo on Dec. 15, 1987. Although he supports a radical restructuring of the economy, he acknowledges he is now linked more with the party's conservative elements than its reformist wing. Under <PERSON> Rakowski </PERSON>'s leadership as premier, the government ended gasoline rationing and legalized the black market in foreign currencies. But in his nine months as prime minister, the economy has deteriorated and <PERSON> Rakowski </PERSON> made little progress in winning the hearts of Solidarity supporters who remember him as one of the union's scrappiest foes. With inflation now in triple digits and many basic commodities such as meat, bread and sugar in short supply, <PERSON> Rakowski </PERSON>'s promotion to the head party post in a 171-41 vote might seem peculiar. He became deputy prime minister Feb. 12, 1981, but his abrasiveness made him enemies. He lost that post in November 1985 when several hard-liners were dumped from the government. From 1985 to 1987, he held a largely ceremonial position as deputy speaker of the Sejm, or Parliament. He was one of 33 senior officials who ran unopposed for <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> in June but failed to capture even half the votes. One party member in the debate Saturday said only 35 percent of Polish people voice confidence in the government now, compared with 72 percent shortly after <PERSON> Rakowski </PERSON> took office. But <PERSON> Rakowski </PERSON>'s calls for the party to stand firm in the face of its difficulties apparently have appealed to party conservatives and those in the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> who feel threatened by the rise of Solidarity's influence. The union won 260 of 261 parliament seats it contested in June. <PERSON> Rakowski </PERSON> succeeds <PERSON> Wojciech </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON>, who resigned Saturday as he had promised to do before being elected president. A man of peasant origins who rose to become one of <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s leading journalists From 1958 through 1982, <PERSON> Rakowksi </PERSON> was editor of Polityka, a Communist-controlled but generally liberal weekly that was considered even daring through the 1970s. The 62-year-old <PERSON> Rakowski </PERSON> was named prime minister Sept. 27 and formed his government Oct. 14. He was rebuffed by opposition members he sought to enlist. Although <PERSON> Rakowski </PERSON> in January urged legalization of Solidarity after its seven-year ban, he did not take an active role in the talks that followed. Solidarity was legalized again in April. <PERSON> Rakowski </PERSON> became unpopular with leaders of Solidarity during its 16-month legal period in 1980-81. One of his first acts as prime minister was to announce the closing of the <ORGANIZATION> Lenin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shipyard </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION>, Solidarity's birthplace, in a move many union members interpreted as a personal vendetta. During Solidarity's early months as a legal group, <PERSON> Rakowski </PERSON> headed the government's committee for trade unions and served as the government's chief negotiator with Solidarity. He also played a major role in defending the suppression of the union after the introduction of martial law Dec. 13, 1981. Born in the village of <LOCATION> Kowalewek </LOCATION> in northwest <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> on Dec. 1, 1926, <PERSON> Rakowski </PERSON> was a teen-age laborer during the Nazi occupation of <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and served in the Polish army from the time of the liberation until 1949. He joined the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> in 1946 and attended the <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. In a widely circulated memorandum on <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s political situation written before his Politburo appointment, <PERSON> Rakowski </PERSON> backed further democratization and economic reform. But he also urged the party to stake out more clearly its ideological differences with Solidarity. In a newspaper interview last week, <PERSON> Rakowski </PERSON> said the party should resist attempts to divide it. He called on the party to become `` a pragmatic leftist party of the 21st century.'' But he added: `` To be pragmatic does not mean to disrespect Marxism and the historical achievements of Polish socialists and communists.''

 The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> began plotting a superpower summit Saturday and Soviet Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> said President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> will meet `` rather soon'' if all goes well. The smiling Soviet official gave this optimistic assessment, and a generally rosy view of superpower relations except for disagreement on <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, after a three-hour and 10-minute meeting with Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> at the Soviet embassy here. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said he would meet <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> again Sept. 19-20, probably in <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>, to make further summit preparations. They and ministers from 17 other countries are attending an international conference on <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>'s future that will open on Sunday with the aim of arranging a cease fire to end a 10-year civil war and put the southeast <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> country on the path to rehabilitation. A Soviet foreign minister official, <PERSON> Vitaly </PERSON> <PERSON> Churkin </PERSON>, said <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> had registered his government's `` disappointment'' with continuing <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> weapons shipments to rebels in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> who are trying to unseat the pro-Moscow government of President <PERSON> Najibullah </PERSON>. But both <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> and <PERSON> Churkin </PERSON> stressed the positive aspects of the meeting, which ran an hour and 10 minutes longer than scheduled. They said <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> had given <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> a letter from Soviet President <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> as well as a series of memoranda to further economic and cultural cooperation and a report on human right s developments in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. Dominating the meeting was <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s program to restructure the Soviet economy. In his report on perestroika, <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> expressed sympathy for striking miners and said they were not challenging the Soviet leader's reform program, a senior <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official told reporters at a briefing. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> offered technical advice to the Soviets on how to switch from a Marxist to a market-oriented economy and reaffirmed <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> hopes <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> would succeed, said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. At a joint news conference in a sunny courtyard, <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> said of prospects for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s first summit with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>: `` If we prepare well and successfully then a summit will take place rather soon.'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials said the <LOCATION> Baker-Shevardnadze </LOCATION> in September probably will be at <LOCATION> Jackson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hole </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wyo. </LOCATION>, a resort favored by judges and wealthy businessmen as well as skiers, was the likely site. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, in response to a question, said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> `` obviously will get together at some point'' but he declined to say whether the summit would be scheduled for this year. He said he had covered a wide range of subjects with <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>, including the <LOCATION> Cambodian </LOCATION> conference, arms control, <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> called the session constructive and businesslike'' while <PERSON> Churkin </PERSON> told reporters it was `` a very relaxed kind of conversation, a shirt-sleeved conversation.'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> and <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> said they decided to appoint a joint U.S.-Soviet delegation to hold periodic meetings on prospects for an Arab-Israeli settlement. <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Ross </PERSON>, a close aide to <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> who heads the policy planning office of the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, will head the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> delegation while <PERSON> Gennadi </PERSON> <PERSON> Terrasov </PERSON> of the Soviet foreign ministry will lead his group. However, on <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Churkin </PERSON> said <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> `` expressed some dissatisfaction with the role the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is playing there.'' Referring to continued <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> arms shipments to the <ORGANIZATION> Mujahedeen </ORGANIZATION>, through <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> official said `` we feel what has happened is part of an attempt at a military solution'' to the country's continuing conflict between the rebels and government forces. On Friday, in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, an <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the Soviets not only had left huge stockpiles of weapons behind when the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> completed its withdrawal on <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> in mid-February, but were providing tanks, Scud missiles and other arms at a rate of up to $ 3 billion a year, or about double what <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> gave the government during its nine-year military occupation. <PERSON> Churkin </PERSON> said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION>, - Soviet efforts toward a 40-nation treaty to ban chemical weapons had `` picked up speed'' and that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet delegations might be upgraded in order to push for agreement soon He said there was no discussion of a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> investigation of a suspended <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official, <PERSON> Felix </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bloch </PERSON>, who is suspected of spying for the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>.

 Israeli troops shot and wounded nine Palestinians in clashes in the occupied territories on Saturday, Arab hospital officials said. An army spokesman confirmed two of the wounded and said the military was investigating the other reports. The spokesman also said a Palestinian living in the Shati refugee camp in the occupied <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> died Saturday morning of injuries suffered in a beating by fellow Arabs. The army identified the man as 23-year-old <PERSON> Walid </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahmoud </PERSON> <PERSON> Baroud </PERSON>. <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> reports said <PERSON> Baroud </PERSON> may have been beaten by Arabs who suspected him of collaborating with Israeli authorities. The army said police were investigating. Palestinians have killed 85 fellow Arabs during the 19-month-old Palestinian uprising against <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> rule of the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>. At least 521 Palestinians have been killed by gunfire in clashes with army troops and Israeli settlers in the occupied lands. Thirty-eight Israelis have also died. In the <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION> suburb of <ORGANIZATION> Rishon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Letzion </ORGANIZATION>, police arrested four Israelis for allegedly beating a 22-year-old Gazan worker, <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION> reported. The radio said the Israelis pushed the <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> man into their car, beat him and threw him on a nearby beach. The report did not identify the Arab or the Israelis, but said one of the Israelis was an off-duty soldier in the paramilitary border police, which is used to suppress Palestinian riots in the occupied territories. In <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, an Arab youth selling cactus fruit was beaten by a group of Israelis, the national <ORGANIZATION> Itim </ORGANIZATION> news agency reported. The youth was hospitalized and one Israeli was detained by police. <ORGANIZATION> Itim </ORGANIZATION> said the <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> was selling fruit in the <PERSON> Shmuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Hanavi </PERSON> neighborhood when he was attacked. The neighborhood borders Arab east <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> and has been a frequent site of attacks on Arab-owned cars. In the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Tulkarem </LOCATION> refugee camp, <PERSON> Samira </PERSON> <PERSON> Sayar </PERSON>, 19, was shot in the left leg when troops opened fire on a group of stone-throwers, Arab hospital officials said.

 For once, a report of beach pollution sent bathers running toward the ocean instead of away from it. More than $ 200 in small bills embedded in sea weed washed up on the shore Friday morning, said <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Cavalier </PERSON>, chief of the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Wildwood </LOCATION> municipal beach patrol. City employees and visitors at the crowded beach scurried along the water, poking through the seaweed in search of the money. `` It was like watching one of those TV shows,'' he said. `` Everyone was running through the water, rooting through the seaweed.'' Beach officials speculated that money dropped over a period of time by bathers accumulated on the ocean bottom, and was kicked up by the surf in a storm Thursday evening. <PERSON> Cavalier </PERSON> said municipal workers cleaning the beach with tractors were the first to notice the money. As they jumped off their tractors to search for the bills, curious beachgoers began to watch them, and immediately joined in the search.

 Sunny skies did n't put a damper on `` Rain Day'' festivities Saturday in this southwestern <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> town, where legend says July 29 is hardly ever dry. `` There's not a cloud in the sky,'' said <PERSON> Melody </PERSON> <PERSON> Longstreth </PERSON>, executive secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> Waynesburg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION>, which helped organize the weekend celebration. Rain has fallen 96 out of the past 112 July 29ths in <LOCATION> Waynesburg </LOCATION>, a community of about 5,000 about 35 miles south of <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>. There have been 19 rainless Rain Days since the town began keeping records in 1876, Ms. <PERSON> Longstreth </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> forecast called for sunny skies Saturday with a high near 80 degrees. Not a drop had fallen by late Saturday afternoon, but Ms. <PERSON> Longstreth </PERSON> said it would n't take much more than a drizzle to satisfy the community on Rain Day. `` Just a few drops in the borough limits is enough,'' she said. The pleasant weather did n't stop residents, many of whom carried umbrellas, from enjoying the festivities. Events included a rain dance, games, an umbrella contest, music, a crafts sale and the making of a banana split served in a 113-foot gutter. Residents say the legend began more than a century ago when a farmer told the town's pharmacist, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, that his records showed it almost always rained on July 29. As the pattern emerged over the years, some residents began marking each Rain Day with weather bets.

 The days of Orthodox Jews having to take their own food out to the ballgame are gone thanks to a new food stand at Memorial Stadium that sells kosher hot dogs. `` I'm going to buy a kosher hot dog, and believe me, it will be a thrill because I've never had a hot dog at an <ORGANIZATION> Orioles </ORGANIZATION> game,'' <PERSON> Eleanor </PERSON> <PERSON> Ashman </PERSON> of <PERSON> Cheswolde </PERSON> said as she lined up at the `` Premier At The Ballpark'' stand operated by <ORGANIZATION> Premier </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Caterers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>, of <LOCATION> Pikesville </LOCATION>. The stand at Memorial Stadium is believed to be the first of its kind at any of the 26 major league baseball parks. `` This is a great boon,'' said <PERSON> Sandy </PERSON> <PERSON> Willner </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Randallstown </LOCATION>. `` My family has box seats at the stadium and we've always had to bring our own food with us. But this is wonderful. It makes me feel like I'm part of the crowd.'' Orthodox Jews require food to be ritually fit in accordance with Jewish law. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Storch </PERSON> is credited with the idea for the stand. <PERSON> Storch </PERSON>, who owns some property the <ORGANIZATION> Orioles </ORGANIZATION> use for a ticket and souvenir store, used his connection with the team to propose the kosher concept. `` Whenever I'd take Orthodox clients to a ball game, we could n't get kosher food,'' said <PERSON> Storch </PERSON>, `` so I had this idea `` People seem excited about it,'' he said. `` I can see it leading to many more stands just like it at ballparks all over the country.'' `` I used to bring my own food to the games, mostly peanut butter and jelly sandwiches. Not anymore. I think this will bring more Jewish people out to the games, definitely,'' said <PERSON> Zev </PERSON> <PERSON> Henesch </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Greenspring </LOCATION>. Even non-Jews were lining up. <PERSON> Herb </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Annapolis </LOCATION> said, `` I happen to like kosher hot dogs. They seem healthier.

 Parisians bid au revoir to city stress Saturday and began their annual summer vacations, battling bumper-to-bumper traffic, delayed flights and packed trains to reach holiday havens overflowing with millions of other travelers. More than 50,000 gendarmes were assigned to patrol the nation's highways as 12 million drivers passed on their way to or from vacations, according to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Highway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> The heaviest traffic, as usual, was reported on highways connecting <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> through <LOCATION> Lyon </LOCATION> with sunny southern <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Riviera </LOCATION>. South of <LOCATION> Lyon </LOCATION>, traffic was brought to a virtual standstill for about 45 miles between <LOCATION> Tain </LOCATION> <LOCATION> L'Hermitage </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Bolene </LOCATION>. Bumper-to-bumper traffic also was encountered by travelers in the southwest between <LOCATION> Montpelier </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Sete </LOCATION> and near <LOCATION> Bordeaux </LOCATION>, where traffic crawled for more than 15 miles around the city. Although more than 82 percent of French vacationers travel by car, traffic jams were not restricted to the nation's highways. A strike by air control tower technicians demanding higher pay delayed thousands of flights Saturday. More than 5,000 planes were expected to take off from the nation's runways during the weekend, about 700 more than on an ordinary weekends. The strike delayed flights from one to three hours, with the longest waits experienced by travelers between <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. The French national railway said it added 200 trains to the schedule to handle increased holiday traffic between July 28 and Aug. 2. Where is everyone going? Tourist authorities say about 50 percent are headed for the coast, where beaches already are lined with hundreds of thousands of baking bodies. Thirty percent are going to the country, 16 percent to the mountains and the rest have opted to spend their free time outside of <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Organize First Opposition in Soviet Parliament</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The first organized opposition in the Soviet parliament in nearly 70 years was formed Saturday by 368 legislators who gathered to plan their strategy for greater political and economic reforms. Even the official news agency <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said the historic event could be described as `` the birth of the Soviet opposition.'' <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> called the organization `` left-radical.'' In another development, <LOCATION> Latvia </LOCATION> joined the two other Baltic republics, <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION>, in declaring itself `` sovereign'' with the right to veto Soviet laws on its territory, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> reported. Among the members of the opposition group are human rights activist <PERSON> Andrei </PERSON> <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON>; maverick Communist <PERSON> Boris </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON>; <PERSON> Vitaly </PERSON> <PERSON> Korotich </PERSON>, editor of the reform magazine Ogonyoky; and economist <PERSON> Gavriil </PERSON> <PERSON> Popov </PERSON>. It will operate under the title Inter-Regional Deputies' Group. <PERSON> Elena </PERSON> <PERSON> Kotova </PERSON>, who participated in the meeting but is not a legislator, said, `` Our desired aim is to have the equivalent of a Western party.'' The Left Socialist Revolutionaries was the last opposition party to survive the Bolshevik purges following the 1917 revolution. It was suppressed in 1922. President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> has ordered many reforms since coming to power in 1985 but has strongly opposed allowing an alternative party to the Communists. Leaders of the new organization said enough contributions have been received to begin publishing a newspaper. <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Bocharov </PERSON>, a deputy from suburban <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, said the newspaper <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> Deputy will start with a circulation of 300,000 and sell for about 80 cents a copy. That is more than 18 times the cost of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> newspaper Pravda but considerably less than a Soviet fashion magazine. Historian <PERSON> Yuri </PERSON> <PERSON> Afanasiev </PERSON>, a deputy from <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, said the group will meet Sunday and hopes to reach agreement on a platform. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> predicted <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> would be elected leader but <PERSON> Afanasiev </PERSON> indicated the group is leaning toward a governing council with several deputies. The organization is still a small minority in the 2,250-seat <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deputies </ORGANIZATION>, the Soviet parliament. <PERSON> Nikolai </PERSON> <PERSON> Medvedev </PERSON>, a deputy from <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION>, said most of his colleagues from the three Baltic republics had left <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> for the weekend but when they returned they could add up to 140 members to the group. It was not clear how many of the opposition deputies are also members of the smaller legislative branch of the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> called the Supreme Soviet. The group could have its most immediate effect on the political process by proposing laws. The Supreme Soviet gained that power this spring but so far it has considered only proposals put forth by the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> leadership. <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> deputy <PERSON> Sergei </PERSON> <PERSON> Stankevich </PERSON>, writing in the first issue of The People's Deputy, said that fears instilled by years of political tyranny made people shy away from an open opposition. <PERSON> Popov </PERSON> opened Saturday's meeting in the crowded auditorium of the <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Filmmakers </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> with a call to bring reform through legal changes instead of what he called the government's `` spontaneous approach'' to crises. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said the group has a place in the reform process but reported some legislators `` have expressed the fear that in this complex time for the country, when unity of action is required, this ` left-radical group' might turn into some kind of opposition.'' Organizers of the group said it has been tolerated by the government bureaucracy and was not allowed to meet in the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION>. Among issues discussed Saturday were proposals that would give enterprises more independence and allow Soviets living abroad who were stripped of their citizenship to reclaim it. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said the <LOCATION> Latvian </LOCATION> parliament's declaration of sovereignty means that `` laws of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S.S.R. </ORGANIZATION> will go into effect on the territory of <LOCATION> Latvia </LOCATION> only after their ratification by the highest organ of government in the republic.'' When <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION> declared its sovereignty last November, the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> called the action unconstitutional. On Thursday, however, the Supreme Soviet gave preliminary approval to resolutions that would give <LOCATION> Latvia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION> economic independence by Jan. 1. <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION> has tried to assert independence on issues of public concern, such as environmental protection. <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION> followed <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION>'s example this summer after its Sajudis reform group won a majority of the republic's seats in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s first contested elections for parliament.

 Republicans held a grand old party Saturday to welcome their latest convert, Rep. <PERSON> Tommy </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>, who defected from the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> ranks earlier this week. `` I know how hard it is to be a Southern conservative Democrat. My conscience is now clear,'' <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> told about 150 cheering Republicans. `` I have now made my decision and it is the right one for the people of this state.'' President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> announced the three-term <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION> congressman's party change Friday <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> was the third Democrat in three days to make the switch. Also changing parties were retiring <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> Chief <PERSON> Maurice </PERSON> <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> _ widely considered a mayoral prospect for the capital _ and <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> Secretary of State <PERSON> Fox </PERSON> <PERSON> McKeithen </PERSON>. `` That party has shut out <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> and that party has lost <PERSON> Tommy </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>,'' he said. `` I can no longer be a member of that party.'' Republican leaders raved about their newest congressman. Former Lt. Gov. <PERSON> Maurice </PERSON> `` Footsie'' <PERSON> Britt </PERSON> called it the `` first crack in the dam'' of recruiting from the Democratic ranks. `` He really is a phenomenon,'' said party activist <PERSON> Emaline </PERSON> <PERSON> Holleman </PERSON> of <PERSON> Wynne </PERSON>. `` I think <PERSON> Tommy </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> will bring us votes,'' she said. <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>, 47, and his wife, <PERSON> Carolyn </PERSON>, were cheered by an audience that waved small <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> flags and swayed to a Dixieland band. Meanwhile, <ORGANIZATION> Arkansas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> James </PERSON> `` Skip'' <PERSON> Rutherford </PERSON> said Saturday that he has already received several calls from people who are interested in running against <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>. `` People are looking more seriously now,'' <PERSON> Rutherford </PERSON> said. `` There is a lot of interest in the Second District seat.'' <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>'s move leaves the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> with 256 Democrats, 176 Republicans, and three vacancies. <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> said he will meet with <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> leaders on Monday to discuss new committee assignments. As a Democrat, he had served on the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, but the switch means he will lose his old seat. The <ORGANIZATION> Robinsons </ORGANIZATION> were joined on a stage decorated with red, white and blue balloons by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON> Duncan </PERSON> <PERSON> Hunter </PERSON>, R-Calif., who praised <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>'s work on a drug interdiction bill they co-sponsored <PERSON> Hunter </PERSON> said he admired <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> for defying the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Democratic leadership.

<HEAD>Government Veers Away from Marxism with New Economic Policies.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MAPUTO, Mozambique (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Prime Minister <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Machungo </PERSON> outlined the ruling party's new political and economic policies Saturday and said an independent economy is necessary to build socialism. The outline indicated that the party _ the Front for the Liberation of <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION>, or <LOCATION> Frelimo </LOCATION> _ is moving away from Marxism and central planning. <ORGANIZATION> Frelimo </ORGANIZATION> has governed <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION> under a one-party, Marxist-Leninist policy since gaining power after the country gained independence from <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION> in 1975. But its policy document, presented last week to <ORGANIZATION> Frelimo </ORGANIZATION>'s first national congress since 1983, dropped all references to Marxism. The document described the party as socialist. It also said <ORGANIZATION> Frelimo </ORGANIZATION> is open to all Mozambicans and is not just a worker-peasant alliance. The party congress has already been presented with its <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>'s recommendations to open ranks to businessmen, property owners, shopkeepers and religious believers. The congress convened July 24 and is to close Monday. During Saturday's session <PERSON> Machungo </PERSON> said, `` The process of building socialism requires the creation of an independent and advanced economy.'' He said the effort also would require `` the active participation of various property regimes _ state-owned, cooperative and peasant family property, and private or joint-venture forms of property.'' Several years ago the government began opening the economy, encouraging private enterprise and foreign investments mainly to meet requirements for loans from the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monetary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>. About half of <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION>'s 14 million people are wholly or partly dependent on donated food and 1.6 million are refugees from the 12-year-old civil war that has left hundreds of thousands dead. <PERSON> Machungo </PERSON> said the major change from the social and economic directives of 1983 `` is that today <ORGANIZATION> Frelimo </ORGANIZATION> does not attempt to establish target figures for every sector of the economy. Instead the directives set out basic policy goals.'' He said the new directives `` lay heavy stress on peasant family agriculture rather than on state farms,'' but that state farms still have an important role in producing exports. <PERSON> Machungo </PERSON> said the directives also call for `` increased labor productivity and for the implementation of the principle of paying more to those who work more, carry out their duties better and attain the best indexes of efficiency.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> said it would allow private schools, outlawed in 1975, to be re-established because the government was unable to provide education for all of the country's children. It said rebels have destroyed or forced the closure of 2,699 primary schools in rural areas.

 Parliament Speaker <PERSON> Hashemi </PERSON> <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> was elected president by a landslide majority, according to official returns announced Saturday. Government-run <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> radio reported <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> won 13,468,355 out of 14,192,802 votes cast Friday in 192 out of 198 regions, or about 95 percent.

The changes are designed to eliminate competing power centers that have for years paralyzed the government and blocked economic reforms.

 Eleven prisoners were executed in six states last year, less than half the number of inmates put to death the previous year, the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Saturday. The executions in 1988 brought to 104 the total number of inmates put to death since 1976, when the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> reinstated capital punishment. The department, in a study by its <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Statistics </ORGANIZATION>, said those put to death during 1988 had spent an average of six years and eight months awaiting execution for their crimes. <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> each executed three inmates last year, with two in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> and one each in <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>. Six white males and five black males were executed last year. During 1988, state courts sent 296 defendants to death rows in state prisons following their conviction and sentencing for murder, the report said. The death sentences of 116 inmates already on death row were vacated or commuted last year, the study said. At year's end, 2,124 prisoners were under death sentences in 34 of the 37 states that authorize capital punishment. There were no death-row prisoners in the other three states, according to the study. Of the nation's death-row inmates last year, 1,238 _ or 58.3 percent _ were white and 853 _ 40.2 percent _ were black. The study said 21 were American Indians and 12 were Asian. This group included 23 women. State prisons in Southern states held 59 percent of the nation's death-row inmates last year, while 19 percent were in prisons in Western states Sixteen percent were on death rows in state prisons in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> and almost 6 percent were awaiting execution in the Northeast. The study said that 193 of those sentenced to die last year were white males while 89 were black males, four were male American Indians and 5 were male Asians. The group included three while women and two black women. Last year, <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> had the most new prisoners on death row _ 42 _ followed by <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, where 34 defendants were ordered sent to prison to be executed. <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> had 32 new prisoners sent to death row last year, the report said.

 Wildfires forced 2,500 people from their homes the <LOCATION> Sierra </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> foothills of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> Saturday, and in <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> was alerted to prepare to join the battle against dozens of timber blazes. In all, about 37,000 acres of brush, grass and timber were scorched by a flurry of wildfires being battled by 7,200 firefighters in three Western states. In <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, about 2,500 people, including 150 nursing home patients, were kept from their homes Saturday by a wildfire that consumed 6,000 acres of grass and brush above <LOCATION> Fresno </LOCATION> on the edge of the <ORGANIZATION> Sierra </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION>. A house, two mobile homes, a barn and one unidentified structure were destroyed Friday. Efforts of 1,500 firefighters to contain the blaze were hampered by temperatures expected to top 100 degrees and by rising wind that threatened to spread the flames, said Lt. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> McDonald </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Fresno </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sheriff </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. The fire was started Friday by man or machinery, he said. `` At night we have down-canyon winds, and in daylight up-canyon winds, so a fire can start turning up on you,'' said <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Blow </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forestry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman. A line of bare earth was cut around 40 percent of the fire by midday Saturday, and more than a dozen aircraft dumped water and fire-retardant chemicals on the blaze. People were evacuated from the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Auberry </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Meadow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lakes </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Alder </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Bald </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountain </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Basin </PERSON>, said <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forestry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Akers </PERSON>. <PERSON> Leeota </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramsey </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Meadow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lakes </ORGANIZATION> was n't supposed to drive since she gave birth by Cesarean section 10 days before the fire, but she had to drive the 40 miles downhill with her two small children and her mother. `` I'm hurting a little bit and feeling awfully hungry,'' <PERSON> Ramsey </PERSON> said. `` We did n't get a chance to eat dinner.'' In <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, dozens of small blazes touched off by lightning earlier in the week were joining into huge forest fires Saturday. More than 3,000 firefighters joined the battle, and Gov. <PERSON> Cecil </PERSON> <PERSON> Andrus </PERSON> declared an emergency, putting the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> on notice that troops could be called in to help. Top priority was given to the 1,800-acre <LOCATION> Fleming </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Creek </LOCATION> blaze that was threatening commercial stands of timber and spewing smoke visible 50 miles to the south in <LOCATION> Boise </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Boise </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Interagency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> marked a new record late last week on the amount of retardant dropped in <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> by planes, said center spokesman <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Rohnert </PERSON>. The converted World War II bombers dumped 125,200 gallons in about 43 hours. In the <ORGANIZATION> Boise </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION>, three separate groups of fires were burning, including one east of Cascade that posed an erosion threat to salmon spawning beds on the South Fork of the <LOCATION> Salmon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>. Fires also were burning in the <ORGANIZATION> Payette </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Nez </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Perce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Challis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION>, and on federal land in southwestern <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>. In eastern <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>, five forest fires, most of them set by lightning earlier in the week, raged out of control Saturday, burning about 5,500 acres. About 1,500 firefighters were on the lines. The biggest _ a cluster of four blazes being fought as one _ burned through 2,500 acres of potentially valuable timber east of the town of <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Day </PERSON>. Warm temperaturs and winds up to 35 mph hampered the firefighting effort, said <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> Kimble </PERSON>. `` We're just having to back off,'' <PERSON> Kimble </PERSON> said. Other Oregon fires were on <LOCATION> Dooley </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountain </LOCATION> south of <LOCATION> Baker </LOCATION>, at <LOCATION> Koontz </LOCATION> creek south of <LOCATION> Baker </LOCATION>, near the <LOCATION> Anthony </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lakes </LOCATION> ski area northwest of <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> and one near the boundary of the Eagle Cap Wilderness south of Enterprise. In <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, in addition to the blaze near <LOCATION> Fresno </LOCATION>, a fire that threatened homes in the rural central <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> community of <LOCATION> Atascadero </LOCATION> was 80 percent contained Saturday after burning 10,500 acres of brush. The blaze, started Thursday by a spark from an off-road motorcycle, destroyed 15 to 20 outbuildings, including barns and garages, as well as two cars and a truck, said <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forestry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Alsop </PERSON>. In the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> suburb of Walnut, a brush fire that forced evacuation of 800 students from <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Polytechnic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Pomona </LOCATION> was contained Friday night by about 200 firefighters, said <PERSON> Rafael </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortiz </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. One firefighter suffered second-degree burns battling the blaze, he said.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- Disciples of Christ -RRB- Saturday endorsed a working partnership with the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christ </ORGANIZATION>, despite criticism from some members that the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> is too liberal. Delegates to the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- Disciples of Christ -RRB- <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> approved a resolution for full communion between the two churches, including mutual recognition of members and clergy. The resolution means the churches will recognize each other's members as believers in a single common faith, said <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Crow </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, the president of the council on Christian unity He said they will also work to coordinate the two churches' social services and community functions About 6,000 delegates attended the first day of business of the five-day <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- Disciples of Christ -RRB- General Assembly, officials said. The <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christ </ORGANIZATION> passed a similar resolution at its national convention in <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, a month ago. `` This is not a merger. It's not a uniting of the churches' structure,'' <PERSON> Crow </PERSON> said `` This is setting up a common acknowledgement of each other.'' The move means the two congregations can attend the same worship services, but <PERSON> Crow </PERSON> says local churches will maintain their own identities. The Disciples of Christ and the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christ </ORGANIZATION> base their faith on the same Christian doctrine, <PERSON> Crow </PERSON> said. The two organizations already work together in much of their missionary endeavors, but they differ in some worship practices and church policies, he said. One of those policies is a <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christ </ORGANIZATION> clause that forbids church boards from considering sexual orientation of its ministers. That means the church officially allows homosexuals to become ministers and forbids member churches from discriminating against them. `` In putting our stamp of approval on this, we are putting our stamp of approval on homosexuality,'' said <PERSON> Bethel </PERSON> <PERSON> Nason </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Topeka </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Kan </PERSON>. Her statements against the resolution brought a round of applause from delegates. The resolution does not mention the issue of homosexuality. Disciples of Christ delegate <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolfe </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Spearman </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, charged the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christ </ORGANIZATION> is `` far to the left, both political and ecumenically.'' But <PERSON> Crow </PERSON> said the differences in social beliefs are as common within the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- Disciples of Christ -RRB- as they are between the two denominations. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> allows for unity in diversity but that diversity need not divide us,'' he said. Disciples President <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> O. </PERSON> <PERSON> Humbert </PERSON> also unveiled a model for a proposed $ 15 million building in downtown <LOCATION> Indianapolis </LOCATION> that will house the Church's international offices. He said construction is expected to be completed by 1992. The <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- Disciples of Christ -RRB- was formed in 1832 as part of an early frontier movement to unify Christians. The <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christ </ORGANIZATION> was formed 32 years ago from other <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> sects. Both organizations allow for varied opinions and stress freedom of interpretaton.

<TEXT>
 The Secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> on Saturday denied that <ORGANIZATION> Greenpeace </ORGANIZATION> protesters forced the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> to scrap a Trident 2 missile launch off <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canaveral </LOCATION>. Instead, foreign flag ships prompted officials to call off Friday's scheduled test, said <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Garrett </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> canceled the Trident 2 test several hours after four <ORGANIZATION> Greenpeace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> U.S.A. </ORGANIZATION> vessels penetrated the safety zone and chased a submarine involved in the test in the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> about 50 miles off the cape. A statement issued by the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> said the launch was postponed `` because of intentional interference from foreign flag ships in a designated hazardous operational area.'' Some <ORGANIZATION> Greenpeace </ORGANIZATION> vessels fly foreign flags. `` We did not disrupt the proposed shot yesterday because of the <ORGANIZATION> Greenpeace </ORGANIZATION> activity,'' <PERSON> Garrett </PERSON> said. `` There were foreign flag vessels in the area. It's a normal precaution that we take, and if we have to delay, it's still not going to disrupt the schedule.'' <ORGANIZATION> Greenpeace </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Shannon </PERSON> <PERSON> Fagan </PERSON> said two large <ORGANIZATION> Greenpeace </ORGANIZATION> ships and two motorized rafts carrying anti-nuclear activists shadowed the launch submarine <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> for hours in international waters. Safety regulations require that a countdown be stopped if non-essential boats come within about three miles of the submarine. One raft was photographed beside the submarine. The planned launch was to be the second underwater test firing of the Trident 2, the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s newest, most powerful weapon. The first test March 21 ended in an explosion when the $ 23.7 million missile pinwheeled out of control four seconds after it was launched from the <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>. Nineteen land launches, 15 of them successful, preceded the sea trials.

<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Hundreds of heads huddled close to the glossy photographs Saturday, and fingers furtively pointed out familiar faces and places. This was no ordinary photography exhibit: It was a record, albeit partial, of the biggest protests in Communist <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, and many of the viewers took part. `` Look, I know him,'' one young girl whispered to a friend as they studied a photograph of student leaders addressing a crowd during the pro-democracy movement that is now officially condemned as an anti-socialist rebellion. The girl looked quickly around to see if anyone heard. But no one seemed to be paying attention; everyone had their own associations connected with the seven weeks of marches and sit-ins that ended June 3-4 when the army attacked. Hundreds and possibly thousands of people died. The three-room exhibit at the <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> Art Museum that opened Friday afternoon was the latest in a series of official efforts to convince the public that the army acted correctly. Government books and television programs have given the official version of the events. The Military Museum of the <ORGANIZATION> Chinese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revolution </ORGANIZATION> has put tanks burned by protesters on display in its front courtyard, along with several burned public buses used as street barricades against the army's advance The dramatic exhibit included pictures of soldiers recapturing <LOCATION> Tiananmen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION>, where the students made their headquarters during the protests. Many pictures were shown for the first time in public. No photo credits were given, but they clearly were the work of military or police photographers with special access. There were huge aerial shots of <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> streets filled with banner-waving marchers, of the student tent city in <LOCATION> Tiananmen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION>, of lone soldiers guarding the square at sunrise. There were soldiers with cracked skulls and bloodied clothing, and soldiers' bodies on fire and the charred remains The exhibit did not contain any pictures of civilians wounded or killed. Western journalists shot dozens of pictures of students carrying their wounded on their backs or on pedicabs. The official purpose of the display may have been education, but many viewers went to remember and search for clues to really happened in Tiananmen Square. `` That's <PERSON> Chai </PERSON> <PERSON> Ling </PERSON>, that's <PERSON> Guo </PERSON> <PERSON> Haifeng </PERSON>, there's <PERSON> Ma </PERSON> <PERSON> Shaofang </PERSON>,'' a well-groomed woman said to a friend, referring to student leaders who are now fugitives or under arrest. Only Ma was identified in the picture. `` Look at how the soldiers came in here,'' a youth said, placing his finger on a mass of green-uniformed figures trying to push its way through a civilian crowd. `` They could n't go forward or back, that's when they used the tear gas.'' Some viewers broke into smiles or laughs upon seeing again the marchers' banners: `` Step down, <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Peng </PERSON>. Retire, <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaoping </PERSON>.'' Hoisting such slogans now against the premier and senior leader would mean certain arrest. One young man pressed his face within inches of a dark, smoke-hazed view of soldiers moving into <LOCATION> Tiananmen </LOCATION>, trying in vain to make out whether students remained on the vast expanse. Many Chinese now discount rumors, circulated immediately after the army attack, of thousands of deaths in the square and of the army burning bodies, but few believe the government account that all the students left the square first and that no one was killed there. The government has acknowledged that more than 200 civilians died, including some innocent bystanders. Chinese witnesses and Western intelligence reports say that up to 3,000 people may have been killed.

<HEAD>Military Regime Gives Itself Broad Powers Over Judiciary</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The country's new military ruler further consolidated power Saturday by decreeing broad judicial powers for himself. The order gives Lt. Gen. <PERSON> Omar </PERSON> <PERSON> Hassan </PERSON> el-Bashir power to appoint the chief justice and senior judges. He can also commute death sentences and issue reprieves without explanation. The decree, which <PERSON> el-Bashir </PERSON> signed as head of the ruling 15-officer junta, named him `` supreme constitutional authority in the country.'' Shortly after Prime Minister <PERSON> Sadek </PERSON> <PERSON> el-Mahdi </PERSON>'s civilian government was overthrown in a bloodless coup on June 30, el-Bashir made himself prime minister, minister of defense and military commander-in-chief of this East African nation. He dissolved <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION>'s 36 political parties and banned all newspapers and magazines. In the past, <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION>'s chief justice was elected by other judges. Senior judges were nominated by the chief justice and appointed by a five-member <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> El-Bashir </PERSON> has accused officials of the former government and many political party members of corruption. He has said those accused of wrongdoing will stand trial. <PERSON> El-Mahdi </PERSON> has been imprisoned with about 40 former senior political figures.

 Delegates attending the <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chinese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Students </ORGANIZATION> in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> on Saturday created a fledgling national student union aimed at pressuring <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> for democratic reforms. After lengthy debate and overnight revisions, delegates ratified a constitution creating the All-America Chinese Student Union. `` It's not perfect enough, but it's really a very good start,'' said <PERSON> Ding </PERSON> <PERSON> Jain </PERSON>, chairman of the congress. Creation of the union was the main focus of the three-day congress, which attracted Chinese students from across the country, a spokesman for the congress said. The union will coordinate efforts to bring pressure on <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> to adopt pro-democratic reforms, said <PERSON> Pei </PERSON> <PERSON> Minxin </PERSON>, 31, a graduate student from <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> and spokesman for the congress. After ratifying the constitution, the congress voted on a variety of proposed projects for the union to undertake. The projects include lobbying governments for economic sanctions against <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, organizing boycotts against <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and assuming joint management with the <ORGANIZATION> Chinese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journalist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> the weekly newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Freedom </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION>. The paper was founded by a group of journalists in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> on June 9, 1989. Many of the proposals have been tried by individual student organizations before, <PERSON> Pei </PERSON> said, `` but now, with the establishment of this union, there is a legitimacy, a broad-based legitimacy to these efforts ... and conceivably we will attract more support from <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> students across <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>.'' The union's creation was brought about by the June 3-4 army attack in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> in which hundreds of pro-democracy demonstrators were killed in Tiananmen Square, <PERSON> Pei </PERSON> said. Chinese students in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> believed there had to be other ways to change the government in their native country, <PERSON> Pei </PERSON> said. `` Why not choose another less costly message, such as lobbying for these individual measures?'' <PERSON> Pei </PERSON> said. `` Conceivably Chinese students will work through this organization to voice their pro-democratic ideas and opinions and also voice their protests against the human rights violations by the Chinese government,'' he said.

 President <PERSON> Wojciech </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON> resigned Saturday as <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief and was replaced by the outgoing prime minister, <PERSON> Mieczyslaw </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rakowski </PERSON>, who has become a champion of conservative elements in the party. In another apparent victory for party conservatives, two hard-liners were named to the ruling Politburo in a shakeup that came on the last day of a <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> plenum. Four of the 18 Politburo members and five of the nine party secretaries _ most reformers or linked to <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON> _ were dropped. Party spokesman <PERSON> Janusz </PERSON> <PERSON> Bisztyga </PERSON> called the move a drive for `` new faces.'' In addition to quitting as party chief, <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON> also resigned from the Politburo and the policy-setting <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> in what appeared to be an effort to show total commitment to the presidency. <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON> had promised to resign as party chief, a post he held since 1981, if he became president. He was elected July 19 to the position, created as part of reforms agreed to in talks this year between Communist authorities and the Solidarity trade union movement. As president, <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON> has control of the military and foreign policy matters and will choose a prime minister to head the government. The official news agency <ORGANIZATION> PAP </ORGANIZATION> said the gathering of the party <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> and party deputies of parliament elected <PERSON> Rakowski </PERSON> 171 to 41 to replace <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bisztyga </PERSON> said <PERSON> Rakowski </PERSON> was the only candidate. The selection of the 62-year-old <PERSON> Rakowski </PERSON> culminated a remarkable political rise by the politician, who joined the Politburo only in December 1987 after having been dropped from the government in 1985, along with several other hard-liners. `` The party is in a difficult situation, but I believe I have support from thousands of party members,'' <PERSON> Rakowski </PERSON> told state television later. `` I am aware of the importance of the job, and I believe that we can find a way out of this difficult situation.'' <PERSON> Rakowski </PERSON> has been sharply criticized for the way he handled the economy during his nine months as prime minister. But despite triple-digit inflation, food shortages and his plan to rise food prices Aug. 1, <PERSON> Rakowski </PERSON> was believed to have gathered support from hard-liners and party members fearful of the growing influence of Solidarity. He is disliked by Solidarity for his antagonism toward the union during the martial-law crackdown of 1981 and for his decision last year to close the <ORGANIZATION> Lenin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shipyard </ORGANIZATION>, where Solidarity was founded nine years ago. He was one of 33 senior officials who ran unopposed for Parliament in June elections but failed to capture even half the votes. He handed in his government's resignation last month after the new parliament was seated. Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> immediately sent congratulations to <PERSON> Rakowski </PERSON>, saying cooperation between the Soviet and Polish parties will continue `` in spirit of party friendship and mutual understanding,'' <ORGANIZATION> PAP </ORGANIZATION> said. The Central Committee conferred for several hours on who would be selected prime minister but made no announcement before adjourning late in the evening. <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON> was to present his choice for prime minister to the parliament Monday for approval. Potential candidates appeared to be Politburo member <PERSON> Wladyslaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Baka </PERSON>, Deputy Prime Minister <PERSON> Ireneusz </PERSON> <PERSON> Sekula </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peasant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Roman </PERSON> <PERSON> Malinowski </PERSON> and Interior Minister Gen. <PERSON> Czeslaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Kiszczak </PERSON>. <PERSON> Baka </PERSON> quit Friday as party secretary in charge of the economy after harshly criticizing <PERSON> Rakowski </PERSON>'s performance as prime minister. His resignation was accepted during Saturday's session. It was unclear if he resigned to become prime minister or if he was leaving to protest the economic record of the <PERSON> Rakowski </PERSON> government. According to <ORGANIZATION> PAP </ORGANIZATION>, the plenum also adopted a resolution declaring the party's willingness to work with Solidarity and with the 260 Solidarity lawmakers chosen in the June election. Solidarity now controls 99 of 100 seats in the new freely elected <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and 161 of the 460 seats in the Sejm, or parliament. The resolution reaffirmed the party's January decision to legalize Solidarity and `` defined conditions'' needed to improve the economy, <ORGANIZATION> PAP </ORGANIZATION> said, without elaborating. Besides <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON>, the Central committee accepted Politburo resignations from <PERSON> Jozef </PERSON> <PERSON> Czyrek </PERSON>, <PERSON> Kazimierz </PERSON> <PERSON> Barcikowski </PERSON>, <PERSON> Stanislaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Ciosek </PERSON> and <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Miodowicz </PERSON>. <PERSON> Miodowicz </PERSON> said he resigned because of wishes of members of the official trade union alliance OPZZ, which he heads. They were replaced by <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> party chief <PERSON> Janusz </PERSON> <PERSON> Kubasiewicz </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Katowice </LOCATION> party chief <PERSON> Manfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorywoda </PERSON>, both hard-liners, and by <PERSON> Leszek </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, a party secretary who has been active in promoting the party to young people. Dropped as party secretaries were Czyrek, <LOCATION> Ciosek </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Baka </PERSON>, <PERSON> Marian </PERSON> <PERSON> Orzechowski </PERSON> and <PERSON> Zygmunt </PERSON> <PERSON> Czarzasty </PERSON>. <PERSON> Baka </PERSON> and <PERSON> Orzechowski </PERSON> remain members of the Politburo. <PERSON> Czarzasty </PERSON> had been brought in as a party secretary by <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON> as part of a new generation of reformers only seven months ago. With the exception of <PERSON> Miodowicz </PERSON>, those dropped were reformers or closely linked to <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON>. All of the departing officials said they resigned, but it was not clear if their resignations all were voluntary. <ORGANIZATION> PAP </ORGANIZATION> said only that the resignations were accepted.

 American evangelist <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> <PERSON> Graham </PERSON>, on his fourth visit to <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, preached to an estimated 90,000 people Saturday in a <LOCATION> Budapest </LOCATION> soccer stadium. The stadium seats 70,000, so many people stood on the field as <PERSON> Graham </PERSON>, speaking from a platform, told the crowd, `` God knows everything'' and `` salvation is through Christ.'' Organizers said it was the largest crowd ever gathered in the stadium. The predominantly young audience frequently cheered <PERSON> Graham </PERSON>. He spoke in English and the sermon was translated into Hungarian. `` I see we have a capacity crowd here. This is an indication of the spiritual yearning and hunger,'' <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> said. He did not make any political comments but when he arrived Tusday he said <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s religious life was `` at a great historical turning point.'' `` I believe our present visit is another sign of this new spirit of openness and change,'' he said. The state news agency <ORGANIZATION> MTI </ORGANIZATION> published a brief report on <PERSON> Graham </PERSON>'s service and said among those attending the event were <PERSON> Matyas </PERSON> <PERSON> Szueros </PERSON>, the speaker of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, several Hungarian church leaders and <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Palmer </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassador to <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> On Friday, the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> announced major policy changes regarding religion. The party's <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> said the party will not require that members be atheists and will not interfere in church affairs. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Hungarian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> is not an atheist party but a party committed to the cause of social progress,'' <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> member <PERSON> Janos </PERSON> <PERSON> Berecz </PERSON> said after the meeting in <LOCATION> Budapest </LOCATION>. He told a news conference the party will ensure separation of church and state. There are no official statistics on church membership in <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, but 70 percent of Hungarian Christians are believed to be Roman Catholics. In the past, some party members were known to be Catholics but they rarely professed their beliefs in public.

<TEXT>
 Tidal action, erosion and oil-eating microbes could clean most of the oil from <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>'s spill-tainted shores within five years and the beaches could be normal again in 10 years, researchers said Saturday. Speakers at a conference on the nation's largest oil spill said the natural combination could clean up the spill without human efforts. The tanker <PERSON> Exxon </PERSON> <PERSON> Valdez </PERSON> ran aground March 24 and spilled 10.92 million gallons of crude in Prince <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sound </PERSON>. The researchers based their conclusions on studies of previous oil spills with similar characteristics, especially the <ORGANIZATION> Amoco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cadiz </ORGANIZATION> spill off the coast of <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> in 1976. The researchers' findings contradicted statements by <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> Vice Adm. <PERSON> Clyde </PERSON> <PERSON> Robbins </PERSON>, the on-site coordinator of cleanup efforts. <PERSON> Robbins </PERSON> said Friday that the beaches soiled by the spill `` are never going to be clean.'' `` I would be very surprised to see a significant amount of oil -LRB- in <LOCATION> Prince </LOCATION> <LOCATION> William </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sound </LOCATION> -RRB- in five years,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Vandermeulen </PERSON>, a researcher at the <ORGANIZATION> Bedford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oceanography </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Halifax </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nova </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Scotia </LOCATION>. He and <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Atlas </PERSON>, a microbiologist at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Louisville </ORGANIZATION>, said studies of the <LOCATION> Cadiz </LOCATION> incident and other major spills showed that the ecology of the damaged areas appeared to have returned to normal within about 10 years. The researchers used comparisons of fouled areas with similar but unspoiled environments to determine what constituted `` normal.'' `` Most environments I have seen have had recovery to some level of normalcy within five to 10 years,'' <PERSON> Vandermeulen </PERSON> said. `` Even heavily oiled marshes have recovered in 11 years.'' The speed of natural cleanup by microbes is slowed by <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>'s cold temperatures, he said, but the breakdown of crude oil and weathering of shores by wind and erosion continues <PERSON> Atlas </PERSON> said oil-eating microbes exist in the area of the <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> spill, in small numbers. The <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, which has a research station in <LOCATION> Valdez </LOCATION>, has found that their numbers have increased since the spill, he said. Atlas also said general degradation of the <LOCATION> Cadiz </LOCATION> spill appeared to take around 10 years, even if nothing else was done. `` That rate is perhaps reasonable here,'' he said. Oil degradation can be sped up with the use of fertilizers containing nitrogen and phosphorus, a proposal that is being considered. Shore organisms that were destroyed by the spill would also come back fairly quickly, <PERSON> Vandermeusen </PERSON> said. `` Even if we wipe out every one, there are larval ones off shore waiting to settle,'' he said. The experts spoke before an estimated 150 researchers attending a three-day conference on the effects of the oil spill on people, animals and the environment. The conference, which ends Sunday, is sponsored by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Occupational </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Health and the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, among others.

<TEXT>
 A Chinese army officer and his wife defected to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> Saturday through the demilitarized zone separating <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> and communist <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> reported. A government intelligence source, speaking on condition of anonymity, identified the officer as Maj. <PERSON> Zuo </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiukai </PERSON>, 40, a member of the <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> delegation to the <ORGANIZATION> Korean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Military </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armistice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. The commission supervises the 1953 truce agreement that ended the Korean War. The source said <PERSON> Zuo </PERSON> and his wife requested that they be allowed to go to a third country. He said he did not know what country the couple preferred but speculated it would be either <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> or the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` Obviously they do not want to settle down here,'' he said. The <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Hankook </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ilbo </ORGANIZATION> quoted an unidentifed govenrment source as saying the couple probably defected because of their disapproval of the violent military crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators last month in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> reported they crossed the border into <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> from the truce village of <LOCATION> Panmunjom </LOCATION> inside the demilitarized zone shortly after 11 a.m. It said the two were under the protective custody of the American-led <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman Brig. Gen. <PERSON> Yoon </PERSON> <PERSON> Chang-ro </PERSON> said command officials were questioning the officer and his wife and planned to transfer them to South Korean authorities. The <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION> includes representatives of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and 15 other nations that helped <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> after <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> invaded in 1950. The command has headquarters in the border village of <LOCATION> Panmunjom </LOCATION>, 35 miles north of <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>. The government intelligence source said <PERSON> Zuo </PERSON> was the fourth-ranking officer in the 12-member Chinese delegation to the <ORGANIZATION> Armistice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, also based in <LOCATION> Panmunjom </LOCATION>. Seoul-based foreign journalists who became acquainted with <PERSON> Zuo </PERSON> at <LOCATION> Panmunjom </LOCATION> said he speaks English and had served in the Chinese embassies in <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> before being assigned to <LOCATION> Panmunjom </LOCATION> two years ago. Assistant Foreign Minister <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Jung-bin </PERSON> and other government officials met Saturday to discuss the case. The Taiwanese Embassy in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> said it was in contact with South Korean authorities. Some Chinese air force pilots who in past years defected and landed their jet fighters in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> were allowed to go to <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>, which is governed by the anti-communist Nationalist Chinese. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, which sent thousands of troops into <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> to help <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> during the Korean War, was a signatory to the 1953 cease-fire that halted the conflict. Saturday's defection was believed to be the first by Chinese through <LOCATION> Panmunjom </LOCATION>. In 1981 a Czechoslovak enlisted soldier defected to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> through the border village and three years later a Soviet student crossed the border and sought asylum. Both eventually were allowed to go to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> after being processed by a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> refugee commission in <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>.

 How do you make yourself at home in prison? Seventeen drug lords and their lieutenants used mahogany furniture, satin pillows, ornamental plants, porcelain figurines and a private sauna, the attorney general's office says. One even set up a cottage industry in his suite of cells in <LOCATION> Ciudad </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Juarez </LOCATION>, employing other inmates to make clothing for export, the office said. Photographs of <PERSON> Gilberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Ontiveros </PERSON> <PERSON> Lucero </PERSON>'s `` bedroom'' in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> newspapers Saturday showed a double bed with a thick cover and piles of pillows, elaborate mirrors and a wall-to-wall and floor-to-ceiling curtain. An investigation into prison corruption began with the disclosure earlier this month that two of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s biggest drug traffickers were living in opulent quarters in a <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> prison. While <PERSON> Ontiveros </PERSON> was branching out into haberdashery, other drug lords continued to run their narcotics businesses, using cellular telephones to call the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>, the attorney general's office said. A total of 14 cellular telephones have been confiscated, the office said Friday when it released an inventory. The inventory listed microwave ovens, video cassette players, plants, refrigerators, an exercise bicycle, sauna baths, porcelain figurines, dining room furniture, bedroom furniture, office furniture and a jewel-encrusted Rolex watch. Tear gas, pistols, knives, scanners to monitor police radio traffic, cocaine and marijuana also were found, the statement said. The drug lords, men who go by nicknames like The <LOCATION> Beast </LOCATION> and The Quiet One, are now making do with the more Spartan surrounding of the high-security unit at the Southern Prison in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. They were transferred on July 21 from prisons in <LOCATION> Ciudad </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Juarez </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nuevo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Laredo </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Tijuana </LOCATION> in a special operation by federal agents. The attorney general's office also has begun an investigation into prison officials. It said the luxury in which the drug barons were allowed to live showed the degree of their `` economic power and the internal control based on terror.'' Earlier this month the director of prisons admitted that <PERSON> Rafael </PERSON> <PERSON> Caro </PERSON> <PERSON> Quintero </PERSON>, accused of masterminding the 1985 torture-slaying of <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> agent <PERSON> Enrique </PERSON> <PERSON> Camarena </PERSON> <PERSON> Salazar </PERSON>, was living with his uncle and fellow drug lord in a space designed for 250 inmates. Walls had been knocked out to enlarge the cells, which were then outfitted with marble baths, a pool table, air conditioning, guest quarters and wardrobes crammed with dozens of silk shirts.

 The Exxon Valdez edged toward <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> on Saturday as the damaged tanker made its second attempt at entering the harbor for repairs. But the <PERSON> Valdez </PERSON> faced final navigational and environmental inspections before it would be allowed into the bay on Sunday. The ship that caused the nation's worst oil spill was under tow Saturday, scheduled to reach the pilot's buoy at the mouth of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> late Saturday, said <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> Lt. <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Solberg </PERSON>. Since Friday night's departure from waters near <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Clemente </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, 56 miles from here, the ship has been under constant monitoring for the types of discharges that three weeks ago caused it to be turned away from <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> as a pollution risk. Under an agreement between <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shipping </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and five state agencies, the <LOCATION> Valdez </LOCATION> must be leak-free for a 24-hour period prior to entering <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> en route to <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shipbuilding </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> for a nine-month, $ 25 million repair job. <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> put up $ 20 million to ensure its performance and to cover the costs of a cleanup should a spill occur during the Valdez's entry <PERSON> Solberg </PERSON> said the ship successfully executed a series of steering and engine tests Friday night and there were no visible signs of discharges. The Valdez, assisted by tugboats, was expected to come into the bay on its own power under the guidance of senior <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> harbor pilot Capt. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Silva </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr </PERSON>. Meanwhile, <ORGANIZATION> Greenpeace </ORGANIZATION> activists said they would trail the Valdez through the harbor with five sailboats and four inflatable craft in an on-the-water protest. `` We're going to have a little flotilla out there but we're not trying to block it in any way,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Greenpeace </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Blair </PERSON> <PERSON> Palese </PERSON>. `` We want to demonstrate our concern and to bring public attention to the need for a long-term nontoxic energy policy.'' <PERSON> Solberg </PERSON> said the Valdez would be surrounded by eight <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Harbor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Patrol </ORGANIZATION> vessels during the bay transit and a moving safety zone will be enforced 500 yards to the tanker's front and 300 yards from the sides and stern. A final underwater inspection with a remote camera was planned when the ship arrived at the pilot's buoy. `` The purpose of the survey is to determine if the vessel sustained any bottom damage during its transit from <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Clemente </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> and to verify the vessel is in safe condition to transit <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Solberg </PERSON> said. More than 100 tons of dangling steel plates were sheared when they tore loose from the hull framing during the ship's 2,500-mile voyage from <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, where the vessel rammed a reef March 24. The Valdez's hull split open in the accident, and almost 11 million gallons of crude spilled into Prince <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sound </PERSON>. The spill devastated hundreds of miles of Alaskan coastline and wildlife habitat, and cleanup work is ongoing.

 Actor <PERSON> Rob </PERSON> <PERSON> Lowe </PERSON> will do two years' community service to avoid prosecution on charges that he videotaped a young girl performing a sex act at a hotel during the Democratic National Convention, a prosecutor said Saturday. <PERSON> Lowe </PERSON> had faced a possible criminal charge of sexual exploitation of a minor, a charge that carries a maximum 20 years in prison and a $ 100,000 fine, said District Attorney <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Slaton </PERSON>. <PERSON> Lowe </PERSON>, 25, and his father met with <PERSON> Slaton </PERSON> Friday, almost a year after he allegedly taped the sex scene between <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Parsons </PERSON>, who was 16 at the time, and a female companion at a downtown hotel room during the 1988 convention. `` I needed to talk to him to size him up to see if he was OK for the program,'' <PERSON> Slaton </PERSON> said. `` I felt the young man fit in, but I had to be sure of his attitude.'' A telephone call to <PERSON> Lowe </PERSON>'s agent in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> late Saturday was not immediately returned. The agreement was part of the state's pretrial intervention program, `` a hybrid alternative'' to prosecution for young, nonviolent first offenders, <PERSON> Slaton </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Lowe </PERSON> is to work with disadvantaged youths in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> area schools. <PERSON> Lowe </PERSON> remains the subject of a civil lawsuit brought by Miss <PERSON> Parsons </PERSON>' mother, <PERSON> Lena </PERSON> <PERSON> Arlene </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, who claims <PERSON> Lowe </PERSON> seduced her daughter. Terms of the program will be worked out in the next few weeks, <PERSON> Slaton </PERSON> said. He declined to discuss other details of the case. <PERSON> Lowe </PERSON>, star of such films as `` About Last Night ...,'' `` <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elmo </ORGANIZATION>'s Fire'' and `` <LOCATION> Oxford </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Blues </LOCATION>,'' should be finished with the criminal portion of the case, his <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> attorney, <PERSON> Edgar </PERSON> <PERSON> Neely </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, said Saturday. `` That's the end of it,'' <PERSON> Neely </PERSON> said. `` I'm sure <PERSON> Rob </PERSON> is glad to get it behind him so he can concentrate on other things.''

 Five farmers who died trying to save one another in a manure pit were buried Saturday as the family grappled with running the 100-year-old dairy. `` What forced them down into that pit? It certainly was n't fame or glory. It was love,'' the Rev. <PERSON> Leroy </PERSON> <PERSON> Ade </PERSON> told more than 200 people who jammed the <ORGANIZATION> Christ </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Evangelical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lutheran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> for services for <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Theuerkauf </PERSON>, 65, his sons <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, 37, <PERSON> Tom </PERSON>, 28 and his grandson <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON>, 15. `` It was true love for God, love for Christ, and love for a fellow man that caused what we termed a tragedy,'' Ade said. <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Theuerkauf </PERSON> would have turned 66 today. The funeral for <PERSON> Carl </PERSON>'s cousin, <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Hofer </PERSON>, 63, was held later at <ORGANIZATION> Faith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lutheran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> in nearby <LOCATION> Marinette </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wis </LOCATION>. The five were overcome by methane fumes Wednesday morning trying to save each other at the Theuerkauf family dairy barn in <LOCATION> Menominee </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>. Sheriff's officials believe <PERSON> Hofer </PERSON>, a farm employee, went into the 12-foot-deep pit first _ perhaps to clear a drain _ and collapsed after breathing the fumes, which are produced by manure. Each one followed to rescue the man before. <PERSON> Hofer </PERSON> was dead when deputies arrived, said <LOCATION> Menominee </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Sheriff Deputy <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Corwin </PERSON>. Three others died later Wednesday morning at <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Area </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Marinette </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wis. </LOCATION>, and the fifth was pronounced dead at <LOCATION> Children </LOCATION><LOCATION> 's </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> at <LOCATION> Wauwatosa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wis. </LOCATION>, he said. There was about a foot of manure in the pit. County extension service director <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Breyer </PERSON> said the entire community was shaken by the deaths. As a one-mile procession of mourners followed the hearses through town to a country cemetery, <LOCATION> Menominee </LOCATION> residents stood by their front windows and watched. Some stood outside in the rain and others pulled their cars off the road. The Theuerkauf farm has passed from father to son for more than 100 years. Now the only direct adult heir is <PERSON> Carl </PERSON>'s third son, <PERSON> Bill </PERSON>, who was badly injured in an auto accident three years ago. <PERSON> Ade </PERSON> said the women will now run the farm. <PERSON> Breyer </PERSON> said <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Sr. </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Dorothy </PERSON>, would meet with him Sunday to discuss how to handle the dairy farm, among the <LOCATION> Upper </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peninsula </LOCATION>'s largest. The operation likely will have to be cut back. A memorial service was planned Sunday morning at the <LOCATION> Menominee </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> fair, said fair manager <PERSON> Shirley </PERSON> <PERSON> Charlier </PERSON>. The county <ORGANIZATION> Farm </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> closed down its fair booth this year so that volunteers who would have worked it could help the Theuerkaufs instead.

<HEAD>Jet Loses Primary Hydraulic System Just Before Landing</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 An <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> 727 passenger jet lost its hydraulic system just before landing Saturday, forcing the pilot to manually lower the aircraft's landing gear, officials said. None of the 34 people aboard Flight 1042 from <LOCATION> Raleigh </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, was injured during the 4 p.m. landing at Greater <LOCATION> Rochester </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>, said a <LOCATION> Monroe </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> sheriff's deputy, who asked not to be identified. `` There was a loss of primary hydraulics,'' said <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> spokesman <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. A manual back-up system was used to lower the landing gear, <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said. The plane had to be towed down the runway once it landed. The airline had not determined why the hydraulic system malfunctioned. The jetliner would be grounded while the investigation continued, <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said. Passengers on the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> jet said they first learned the jetliner was in difficulty when the pilot made an announcement minutes before it was supposed to land. `` He said we ca n't get the landing gear down,'' said <PERSON> Bernie </PERSON> <PERSON> Wight </PERSON>, 52. `` Everyone said, ` Oh No!''' The jetliner, <PERSON> Wight </PERSON> said, circled <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ontario </LOCATION> while the landing gear was put down manually. On July 19, a <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> DC-10 crashed when a rear engine blew apart, causing complete hydraulic failure. The plane landed in a fiery somersault, killing 111 people. Elsewhere, two other minor airline incidents were reported on Saturday. In <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, an <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> DC-9 lost its fiberglass tail cone while landing at <LOCATION> O'Hare </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> but taxied to the gate without incident, an airline spokeswoman said. Flight 236 from <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> landed at 10:10 a.m., carrying 99 passengers and a crew of six, said <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Bobbi </PERSON> <PERSON> Giordano </PERSON>. In <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, a <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> DC-8 with 197 passengers had to shut down one of its four engines before touching down Saturday night at <ORGANIZATION> Newark </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airport </ORGANIZATION>, but landed safely, authorities said. There were no injuries reported in either incident.

<UNK>Congressmen Sought Funds for Defense Group From Defense Contractors</UNK>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Five congressmen on committees that oversee defense spending helped raise money for a pro-defense group from contractors who do business with the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>, according to a published report. The <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>, in its Sunday editions, reported seven major defense contractors contributed $ 100,000 each in tax deductible donations towards formation of the Institute for the <ORGANIZATION> Common </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> after four of the congressmen, one of them since deceased, invited them to a dinner in the fall of 1987. The congressmen included <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Dickinson </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>, the ranking Republican on the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, a longtime friend and former business partner to ICD's president, <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Markris </PERSON>, said the Post. Joining <PERSON> Dickinson </PERSON> in soliciting funds for the institute were: Sen. <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Gramm </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Texas </LOCATION>, a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>; Sen. <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-La </LOCATION>., who sits on the Appropriations defense subcommittee; and the late Rep. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Chappell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Fla </LOCATION>., then chairman of the subcommittee, the newspaper <PERSON> Dickinson </PERSON> and Rep. <PERSON> Marvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Leath </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, invited the sponsoring firms to another fundraiser for the institute last May, according to the Post. But the contractors decided to end their support when they learned no new contributors had been brought into the venture since the first appeal in 1987. <PERSON> Dickinson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Leath </PERSON> also received speaking fees of $ 20,000 and $ 15,000 respectively from several of the same companies that helped established the group, the newspaper said. The institute's stated goal was to publicize the value of the defense industry. <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dynamics </ORGANIZATION> donated to the group because there `` was a definite feeling there was a need for this type of activity,'' company spokesman <PERSON> Alvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Spivak </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>. `` It did n't hurt that it was supported by Congressman <PERSON> Dickinson </PERSON>,'' he said. `` It probably helped.''

<HEAD>Loan to White House Aide Investigated</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A special prosecutor is investigating whether an aide to President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> violated federal ethics laws by failing to repay a $ 5,000 loan, a newspaper reported. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Webb </PERSON>, a former <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, is trying to determine whether a 1984 loan to <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Cicconi </PERSON> was legitimate or if it represented an illegal gift or bribe from executives of a troubled <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> mortgage company, the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION> reported in its Sunday editions. <PERSON> Cicconi </PERSON>, 37, runs the White House appointment office. The newspaper reported that the `` balloon'' - type loan from <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mortgage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Company </ORGANIZATION> was made in September 1984 for an original term of 90 days Under the arrangement, <PERSON> Cicconi </PERSON> did not have to pay interest, which amounted to 10 percent a year, or principal until the loan expired, and in December 1984, First American exercised an option clause that extended the loan for an additional year. The mortgage company sought protection under federal bankruptcy laws in late 1985, and its owner and other executives later were convicted on federal charges of defrauding company investors of millions of dollars. <PERSON> Cicconi </PERSON>'s lawyer, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hundley </PERSON>, said <PERSON> Cicconi </PERSON> tried on several occasions after the extension expired in December 1985 to repay the loan and its accumulated interest. But <PERSON> Hundley </PERSON> said <PERSON> Cicconi </PERSON> `` just could n't get any information at all as to who owned the note,'' or where to send the money. The <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION> said at least one former executive of the mortgage company has told investigators that an intermediary asked him to `` do him a favor and make this loan -LRB- to <PERSON> Cicconi </PERSON> -RRB- and that it was not to be paid back,'' presumably to win influence at the White House. The intermediary, an executive for a branch of a major Wall Street investment company, has denied making such a request, the newspaper's sources said. <PERSON> Hundley </PERSON> said <PERSON> Cicconi </PERSON> never talked to the intermediary himself and was preparing to quit his job in the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> White House and enter private law practice at the time he sought the loan. The newspaper said that a federal official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said evidence presented to a federal grand jury over the last six weeks `` appears to be supporting <PERSON> Cicconi </PERSON>'s view that it is a legitimate loan. The official said the inquiry, which could last several more weeks, `` may very likely not lead to the indictment of anybody.'' `` It is my understanding that their probe has cleared -LRB- <PERSON> Cicconi </PERSON> -RRB- of any wrongdoing, and that they're going to close it out very shortly,'' <PERSON> Hundley </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Cicconi </PERSON> declined through <PERSON> Hundley </PERSON> to be interviewed. <PERSON> Hundley </PERSON> said he now is negotiating repayment terms with a trustee of the company's assests appointed recently by the bankruptcy court.

 Israeli leaders on Saturday dismissed criticism of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s abduction of a pro-Iranian Moslem cleric and said he led a `` fanatical'' group that had launched terrorist attacks on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Sheik </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdul </PERSON> <PERSON> Karim </PERSON> <PERSON> Obeid </PERSON>, allegedly linked to the capture of <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> and the kidnapping of a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> held hostage there, was abducted Friday from his south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> home and taken to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> in a helicopter. `` There may be some people who voice disapproval, but public opinion will understand that this act was taken against one of the leaders of one of the most fanatical groups in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>,'' said Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s spokesman, <PERSON> Avi </PERSON> <PERSON> Pazner </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials have said <PERSON> Obeid </PERSON> is a leader of the Iranian-backed <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Obeid </PERSON> has denied belonging to the group. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio reported Saturday that <PERSON> Sheikh </PERSON> <PERSON> Abbas </PERSON> <PERSON> Musawi </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> leader who lives in a southern suburb of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, said the organization will not agree to a prisoner exchange and will increase attacks on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. The fundamentalist <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> advocates the destruction of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and its replacement by an Iranian-style Islamic state. In <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> on Saturday, <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Secretary-General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> called the Israeli raid a `` violation of Lebanese sovereignty.'' He demanded <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> return <PERSON> Obeid </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> accused <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> of state terrorism and said the kidnapping could lead to increased extremism and violence in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>. Prime Minister <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> <PERSON> Musavi </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> also called the abduction state terrorism. He issued a statement in <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> saying, `` These kinds of acts will further expand the righteous activities of Lebanese Moslems against <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and its <ORGANIZATION> Phalange </ORGANIZATION> followers.'' The Phalange is a right-wing, predominantly Christian party in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said Friday he could not condone the commando raid and did not know if it would help <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Marine Lt. <PERSON> Col </PERSON> <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>, one of 17 foreigners held hostage in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. British Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> criticized the kidnapping, saying it could hurt the hostages. <PERSON> Pazner </PERSON> said Saturday, `` I do n't remember hearing the same kind of indignation when <PERSON> Sheik </PERSON> <PERSON> Obeid </PERSON>'s people were involved in bloody terrorist attacks from south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> into <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>.'' The Israeli army said <PERSON> Obeid </PERSON> served as commander of <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> in south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> and that the group had organized at least 20 raids on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and its allies in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Yossi </PERSON> <PERSON> Sarid </PERSON>, a left-wing <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> legislator, said, `` The question is not what world public opinion is, but if -LRB- the raid -RRB- is helpful in freeing our kidnapped soldiers.'' Three Israeli troopers believed held in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> are soldiers <LOCATION> Rahamim </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Alsheikh </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Yossi </PERSON> <PERSON> Fink </PERSON>, captured Feb. 17, 1986, when guerrillas ambushed their patrol, and air force navigator <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Arad </PERSON>, seized Oct. 16, 1986, when his plane was shot down. <PERSON> Obeid </PERSON> is the most senior Moslem Shiite leader to be taken captive in recent months by <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> forces battling <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> guerrillas and pro-Iraninan fundamentalists in south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. `` There is no doubt in my mind that the idea here was to have a major exchange,'' said <PERSON> Aharon </PERSON> <PERSON> Levran </PERSON>, a private strategic analyst and brigadier general in the army reserves. `` But I do n't think they -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- will yield immediately and agree to an exchange. `` They want him back as soon as possible, but agreeing to a trade would show that <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> has the upper hand, so it wo n't take place immediately. <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Timor </PERSON> <PERSON> Goksel </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> is believed to hold 300 Lebanese in a prison in south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> run by the Israeli-backed <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lebanon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> militia.

But they were overruled in 1987 by political appointees in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, the Times said. <PERSON> Deborah </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Dean </PERSON>, a friend of <PERSON> Kitchin </PERSON> who was then executive assistant to Housing Secretary <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, was involved in getting the project approved, the Times said. An earlier report said <PERSON> Kitchin </PERSON> received $ 40,000 in consulting fees for an $ 11 million project in <LOCATION> Durham </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, that converted a former hosiery mill into HUD-subsidized apartments for the elderly. One of that project's largest supporters was <LOCATION> Durham </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Markham </PERSON>, who was a former law partner of <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>. <PERSON> Kitchin </PERSON>, an Atlanta-based consultant, has ties to <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> dating back to 1976, the Times said. <PERSON> Kitchin </PERSON> told the Times that he met repeatedly with Ms. <PERSON> Dean </PERSON>. `` You needed her help to understand what was going on at <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION>,'' he said. The Times said Ms. <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> declined to be interviewed. <PERSON> Kitchin </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> project was a good program that deserved federal support. He said he was retained at the project's inception The developer of the 145-apartment <ORGANIZATION> Woodcrest </ORGANIZATION> retirement complex, <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaynes </PERSON>, told the <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> that <PERSON> Kitchin </PERSON>'s intervention was essential to the success of the project. <PERSON> Jaynes </PERSON> said <PERSON> Kitchin </PERSON> `` told me he would talk with somebody in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, that he was up there frequently, that he knew all of these people.'' <PERSON> Jaynes </PERSON> said he remembered talking with Kitchen about Ms. <PERSON> Dean </PERSON>. `` It was pretty plain that <PERSON> Deborah </PERSON> <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> was the power in the secretary's office,'' <PERSON> Jaynes </PERSON> told the Times. <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> has been the subject of internal, congressional and <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> investigations. Mismanagement and abuses have been found in a number of the multibillion-dollar agency's programs. <PERSON> Kitchin </PERSON>, however, has attracted almost no attention from congressional panels investigating possible political influence at the housing department under <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>.

 A Grand Trunk Western Railroad train partially derailed Saturday, forcing several hundred residents from their homes for about 5 -LCB- hours, officials said. No injuries were reported. The evacuation was ordered after what officials believed was battery acid was found leaking from one of the 24 of 67 cars that derailed, said Grand Trunk spokesman <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> Weir </PERSON>. The material turned out to be lard from a car of cow hides, <PERSON> Weir </PERSON> said. The material was contained and the cargo was loaded on other flatcars so it could be moved, he said. The derailed cars toppled a utility pole, briefly knocking out electrical and telephone service in this community just north of the <LOCATION> Michigan-Indiana </LOCATION> border, said Sgt. <PERSON> Rod </PERSON> <PERSON> Cruzen </PERSON>, of the <ORGANIZATION> Cass </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sheriff </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>.

Seven loaded and seven unloaded cars derailed July 22 after the 32-car train had nearly completed its run from <LOCATION> Port </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Huron </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Midland </LOCATION>. The accident, which is being investigated, sparked a fierce chemical fire that spewed heavy smoke and burned until Friday.

 Nine out of 10 Americans think drugs are a chief or important cause of crime and 81 percent favor <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> patrols in drug-infested neighborhoods, according to a survey released Saturday. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> ranked highest in a `` Fear Index'' of the poll, followed by <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> D.C </ORGANIZATION>. The survey, sponsored by the Lexis computer legal research service and the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION>, showed that 77 percent want juveniles treated as adults and 74 percent favor the death penalty for some murderers. Asked to choose the `` chief'' or `` important'' causes of crime, 91 percent said drugs; 87 percent said the failure of the criminal justice system and 81 percent cited a decline in moral and ethical values. But 58 percent would oppose a new tax dedicated to fighting crime and only 41 percent favor it, the survey said. Those polled were asked to score the perceived safety of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> cities, from one -LRB- very safe -RRB- to 10 -LRB- very unsafe -RRB-.

Racism is a problem in the criminal justice system, according to 78 percent of the whites and 93 percent of the blacks surveyed. Forty-five percent blamed police for the problems, while 18 percent blamed prosecutors and 14 percent blamed judges. Among the other findings: _ 90 percent said the legal system makes it too easy for criminals to delay trial or enter a plea bargain. _ 87 percent said the justice system does n't adequately punish criminals. _ 68 percent think violent television shows encourage crime and 63 percent favor laws to restrict violence on TV. _ 62 percent favor the death penalty for major drug dealers. Forty percent of those surveyed said they owned a gun. Of those, 36 percent said they used them for sport, 16 percent for protection and 44 percent for both purposes. Fifty-eight percent, however, believed gun control laws should be strengthened. The poll of 1,000 people was conducted July 7-9 by <ORGANIZATION> Penn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> + </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Schoen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION>. The margin of error, depending on the question, varies from plus or minus 3.1 percentage points to 4.4 points.

 A coal mine flooded Saturday night trapping 21 miners and authorities feared they were dead. `` The possibilities of them being alive are almost non-existent,'' said the town's fire chief, <PERSON> Miguel </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuevas </PERSON>. <PERSON> Cuevas </PERSON> said the flood occurred about 7 p.m. when a section of the mine that was filled with water burst, sending mud and rocks into a section where miners were working. Four miners managed to escape and notified rescue workers. <PERSON> Cuevas </PERSON> said rescue crews and firefighters were on the scene late Saturday night, and that it would probably take 12 hours for them to reach the trapped miners. Curanilahue is about 390 miles south of <LOCATION> Santiago </LOCATION> in the heart of the Chilean coal mining region. The region is wet most of the year and water continuously leaks into the mines, which contain large pockets of water, <PERSON> Cuevas </PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
 Six-year-old Dooney Waters lives in what <LOCATION> Prince </LOCATION> <LOCATION> George </LOCATION><LOCATION> 's </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> police and social service workers call a crack house. The door that leads to the apartment is riddled with bullet holes and gaps that are usually stuffed with wads of paper or balled-up socks where there once were locks. `` Drugs have wrecked my mother,'' says <PERSON> Dooney </PERSON>. `` Drugs have wrecked a lot of mothers and fathers and children and babies. If I do n't be careful, drugs are going to wreck me too.'' <PERSON> Dooney </PERSON>'s tale came in the first of two articles in Sunday's editions of The Washington Post The <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> said a reporter and photographer spent more than two months this spring chronicling <PERSON> Dooney </PERSON>'s life in a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Heights </LOCATION> apartment complex that Prince <PERSON> George </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> police have identified as one of the most active drug markets in <LOCATION> Landover </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Dooney </PERSON> is the child's nickname. Waters is his legal surname. `` My mother do n't take care of me,'' <PERSON> Dooney </PERSON> said during an interview with the newspaper in late May. `` All she want is drugs.'' <PERSON> Addie </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorraine </PERSON> <PERSON> Waters </PERSON>, 32, described herself as a `` slave to cocaine.'' She told the newspaper she allowed drug dealers to use her apartment in exchange for steady support of her habit. The apartment is in a neighborhood where more than a dozen slayings occurred last year but there are no locks on the front door so addicts and drug dealers have easy access. <PERSON> Dooney </PERSON> now lives in the district with his father, a federal employee who asked not to be identified. `` I just could n't let him stay in a place like that,'' said <PERSON> Dooney </PERSON>'s father, who himself served prison time for a drug conviction but has been separated from <LOCATION> Dooney </LOCATION>'s mother for three years. `` There was no one watching over him,'' he said. At home, where <PERSON> Dooney </PERSON> was burned when a woman tossed boiling water at his mother's face in a drug dispute, the boy was painfully shy. But teachers described <PERSON> Dooney </PERSON> as exhaustively outgoing in school where they said he often begged to be taken to their homes. They said he once asked if he could stay overnight in his classroom. <PERSON> Dooney </PERSON> was at home, but asleep when his brother <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> <PERSON> West </PERSON>, 13, was shot in the left shoulder. His mother did n't press charges against <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> `` June'' <PERSON> Powell </PERSON>, the man police charged with shooting <PERSON> Russell </PERSON>. She said <PERSON> Powell </PERSON>, who is out on bail, was trying to shoot someone else, adding that <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> still considers him a friend. `` Everybody knows about the drugs at my house,'' <ORGANIZATION> Dooney </ORGANIZATION> said with a matter-of-fact tone not common to a first-grader. `` The police know, too, but they do n't do nothing about it. Do n't nobody do nothing about it,'' he said. Prince <PERSON> George </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> police said they know about Waters' operation but have never found enough drugs in the apartment to charge her or others `` The problem is that drugs do n't last long up there,'' said Officer <PERSON> Alex </PERSON> <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON>, who patrols the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Heights </LOCATION> neighborhood. `` They use them up as soon as they arrive.''

A communique carried by the government's <ORGANIZATION> Andina </ORGANIZATION> news agency gave this account of the battles: Three army units clashed with a group of about 150 rebels Thursday near <LOCATION> Madre </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mia </LOCATION>, 235 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Huanuco </LOCATION> district. Sixty guerrillas and seven soldiers were killed and 12 troops wounded. Thirty rebels were killed in a fight near the town of <LOCATION> Nuevo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Progreso </LOCATION>, 255 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION>, but the military did not say if the army suffered any casualties.

 When <PERSON> Emma </PERSON> <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> harks back to the days of her youth she sees this western <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> border community as it was then, a bustling little railroad town, a place of high hopes and promise. If only today's young people could see what it was like back then, the 96-year-old woman says. `` Why, we had 22 Greyhound buses stopping here every day. And the trains, land sakes, they stopped here every hour, it seemed like. We had four department stores in <PERSON> Guthrie </PERSON>. The streets were always full of people.'' Now, like thousands of other small towns across the country, <PERSON> Guthrie </PERSON> has been bypassed by the railroads, by the bus lines, by prosperity. And the young people _ looking at now, not then, and seeing no career jobs, no reason to stay on _ flee as soon as they finish high school. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Golden </PERSON> is one of those who fled. `` First, the movie theater closed, shortly after I finished school, 25 years ago. Then, we lost our high school to consolidation. The trains stopped coming after that. More recently, we lost our bus service. Then, last year, the elementary school was closed.'' <PERSON> Hettie </PERSON> <PERSON> Louise </PERSON> <PERSON> Griffey </PERSON>, a retired teacher, said she `` like to cried when they took away our little school. It's been one thing after another.'' Such losses take a terrible toll on the quality of life in a small community. And unfortunately, says <PERSON> Golden </PERSON>, now the research director for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Counties </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Guthrie </PERSON> has become a paradigm for what's happened to many country places in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` It's sad, what has befallen our rural communities,'' he said. <PERSON> Guthrie </PERSON> was a transfer point on the <ORGANIZATION> Louisville </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <LOCATION> Nashville </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Railroad </LOCATION>. It's the birthplace of <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Penn </PERSON> <PERSON> Warren </PERSON>, the Pulitzer prize-winning writer. `` It used to be a proud little town but now there's almost no hope of bringing in new industry or reviving the spirit of the community,'' <PERSON> Golden </PERSON> said. The plight of these troubled towns ca n't be traced to a single cause, but <PERSON> Golden </PERSON> cites two recent blows: the deregulation of the transportation industry in the early'80s and the end, in 1985, of federal revenue sharing, which provided millions for small-town projects. `` With deregulation, the airlines and bus lines pulled out and many communities became increasingly isolated as they lost their daily links to the wider world,'' he said. A 1986 study by the <ORGANIZATION> Interstate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> showed that no fewer than 4,514 points lost bus service between November 1982 and January 1986. By 1986, more than 10,000 of the nation's 18,000 named communities were totally without service. `` And the end of revenue sharing has meant a loss of many essential public works projects and a cutback in those social services so important in holding together a community,'' <PERSON> Golden </PERSON> said. A <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Counties </ORGANIZATION> study earlier this year examining the impact of lost revenue sharing on 28 <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> counties found widespread cuts in senior citizens programs, parks and recreation spending, and fire, police and ambulance services. `` Our small towns are losing hope,'' said Golden. `` We're trying to get a new initiative for rural development from <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. Something needs to be done.'' <PERSON> Guthrie </PERSON> Mayor <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Coke </PERSON> could n't be more in agreement. `` When they took away revenue sharing we lost 20 percent of our budget,'' <ORGANIZATION> Coke </ORGANIZATION> said. `` And we're talking about the part that really hurt.'' As a result, he said, the town's two police cars have well over 100,000 miles each on their odometers, with no funds to replace them. Other services are being maintained at marginal levels,. He shook his head sadly as he surveyed the town's main street, now dotted with sagging, empty storefronts and even emptier sidewalks. `` Back in our heyday the streets were always busy,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Coke </ORGANIZATION>. `` Salesmen would come to <PERSON> Guthrie </PERSON>, park their cars and take the trains because the connections were so good. We had three active hotels then. `` Now, about all that's left of downtown is a drugstore, a funeral home, a hardware store, an auto parts store and a furniture store that's going out of business.'' The town, he said, is full of railroad retirees and their widows. He acknowledged there's little to hold the young people, except maybe the prospect of a job in the local sewing factory or wood treatment plant. `` And who wants that?'' asked 18-year-old <PERSON> Sarah </PERSON> <PERSON> Harper </PERSON> of nearby <LOCATION> Allensville </LOCATION>. `` I'm in college. I come home to work during the summer but I've got no intention of staying here; there's nothing here but farm work or a low-level factory job, nothing you'd want to spend your life doing.'' As a result, <PERSON> Guthrie </PERSON>'s 1,800 residents, like those in other small, rural towns, tend to be older than the national median. And at a time in their lives when residents need ready access to medical services, <PERSON> Guthrie </PERSON> has only a part-time clinic staffed by two general practitioners who work out of a mobile home. From 1980 to 1988, 208 rural hospitals closed, according to the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. Some 130 rural counties, with a total population of more than 500,000, have no active physicians, the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> said. `` We once had seven doctors here,'' recalled <PERSON> Emma </PERSON> <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON>, whose late husband ran a busy service station back in the 1930s, when <PERSON> Guthrie </PERSON> was on the main route between <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. `` They called us the crossroads of the world back then,'' she said. `` You could go anywhere on a train. You could get a train to <LOCATION> Nashville </LOCATION> three or four times before noon, every day. Now, if I want to go to the doctor over in <LOCATION> Clarksville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>, I've got to pay somebody to take me. `` There's no taxi service here, but a local woman has a van and she'll take you the 18 miles down to <LOCATION> Clarksville </LOCATION>. Sometimes it costs me $ 25 to $ 30 to go see the doctor.'' <ORGANIZATION> Coke </ORGANIZATION> points out that <PERSON> Todd </PERSON> <PERSON> County </PERSON> provides <PERSON> Guthrie </PERSON>'s elderly and indigent with once-a-week bus service to <LOCATION> Russellville </LOCATION>, the county seat. But he says most people would be stuck if they did n't have a car or a neighbor to drive them. `` The town started to decline after it was bypassed by the highway and train passenger service began to fall off,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Penn </PERSON> <PERSON> Warren </PERSON>, who long ago left to settle in <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>. Now 84, the novelist and poet was born in the countryside near <LOCATION> Guthrie </LOCATION> and moved to town when he was very young. `` My father went there because of the opportunity,'' he said. `` He was the president of a small bank. I went to school in <PERSON> Guthrie </PERSON> and I can still remember the excitment of the trains stopping at all hours of the day and night. I moved away but my late brother stayed and built a big grain elevator there.'' When his brother was alive, <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> said, he used to return home frequently. Now, like everyone else, he has little reason to go to <PERSON> Guthrie </PERSON>, the onetime `` crossroads of the world.''

 When it comes to a football or basketball game, <ORGANIZATION> Rockwell </ORGANIZATION> is the enemy around here. But when it comes to a more critical issue _ survival _ old rivals are new allies. These two communities have decided that united they stand, divided they fall into the bleak landscape of ghost towns littering <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s heartland. So <PERSON> Thornton </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Rockwell </ORGANIZATION> and five other hamlets have formed a `` cluster'' called the <ORGANIZATION> Area </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commonwealth </ORGANIZATION>, one of a growing number of such programs in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> that aim to keep small towns alive by sharing classrooms, workers or equipment and pooling resources to attract business. `` It's going to take a joint effort to save our schools and save our Main Streets,'' said <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Nannenga </PERSON>, the commonwealth's founder `` We realized we've got to do something to stop our erosion. Basically our only solution is to work together.'' About 17 <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> `` clusters'' have been or are being formed _ one along <ORGANIZATION> Interstate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> 80 </ORGANIZATION>, others within counties _ to offset the 1980s' rural economic decline that has seen farmers lose their land, merchants lose their stores and hard-working people lose their dreams `` If you're sitting in a town of 500, and you start talking about economic and community development, your options are so limited,'' said <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> Borich </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> Iowa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> rural development specialist working with some of the clusters. `` What we're really doing is redefining what community is ... and dispelling some of the fatalism. Maybe if we work together, we can keep the boat afloat yet.'' The Area Community Commonwealth, the first cluster, formed in 1986. Besides <PERSON> Thornton </PERSON> and <PERSON> Rockwell </PERSON>, the group's towns are <LOCATION> Sheffield </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Dougherty </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Swaledale </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Chapin </PERSON> and <PERSON> Meservey </PERSON>. For years, the communities were divided by athletic and economic rivalries, vying for trophies and business dollars. `` There was not a sense of common good,'' <PERSON> Nannenga </PERSON> said. `` It was all for you, none for me.'' Most of the towns had struggled with shrinking school enrollments, the domino-like closings of hardware stores, factories and taverns and the shopping exodus to <LOCATION> Mason </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, which is large enough to support a K mart and <ORGANIZATION> Wal-Mart </ORGANIZATION>. `` Young people left,'' said <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> Persons </PERSON>, a grocer and the commonwealth treasurer. `` Unemployment was high. People's attitudes were down.'' It happened all across <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>. Almost half the gas stations and nearly a third of the state's groceries closed from 1976 to'88, said <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Stone </PERSON>, an <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> State </LOCATION> economist. One big obstacle is most small towns do n't have enough money to hire experts to lure industry, nor enough voters to wield much political influence. The commonwealth towns' separate populations, for example, range from 128 to about 1,200. But as a group, 6,500 people `` give us a little more leverage to be listened to in the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION>,'' Persons said. The group's biggest coup was last year's 60th birthday celebration for <PERSON> Mickey </PERSON> <PERSON> Mouse </PERSON>, organized with the <ORGANIZATION> Walt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. A much-publicized giant silhouette of <PERSON> Mickey </PERSON>'s head, visible from the air, was created by meticulous surveying and planting in a 530-acre corn and oat field between <LOCATION> Sheffield </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Dougherty </PERSON> Transcontinental airline pilots pointed it out to their surprised passengers. Disney worked with the towns to hold a two-day party in August in <LOCATION> Sheffield </LOCATION>, which drew 45,000 people. The commonwealth netted abut $ 48,000 _ profits from T-shirts and hats and other concessions. Other projects are much smaller, such as a grade sharing program in which two school districts exchange junior high and high school students, filling classrooms and saving money. Two towns share a police officer, and some small retail outlets have set up satellite stores so residents do n't have to travel 20 miles to get film developed or buy vegetables or hardware. There's no more Us vs. Them. `` We've turned a win-lose situation into a win-win situation,'' <PERSON> Nannenga </PERSON> said. An industrial park also was established in <LOCATION> Rockwell </LOCATION> in 1988 and a small water bottling company has opened, receiving a $ 30,000 loan from a $ 50,000 state grant the commonwealth received. A company that makes equipment that picks up recyclable products is considering moving there. `` We ca n't handle the industries that are going to employ 150 to 200 people,'' <PERSON> Nannenga </PERSON> admitted. `` We do n't have the housing. We do n't have the infrastructure. We may not be able to sell washing machines, but we can fix them.'' Practicality is an important part of a cluster's success, said <PERSON> Kathy </PERSON> <PERSON> Beery </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>'s rural development coordinator. `` If you have some unrealistic goals it's going to be very frustrating. You do n't want to come together just because you're desperate Perhaps there's some natural resource they can build on ... or perhaps some existing business.'' Five communities in a cluster north of <LOCATION> Des </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Moines </LOCATION> are doing that, developing a nature trail-biking corridor shared by three of the towns. `` We do n't want to lose the spirit of competition ... yet we want to capitalize on cooperation,'' said Mayor <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Hammond </PERSON> of <PERSON> Slater </PERSON>, one of the towns. `` This is the only way we're going to survive.''

 Worn by long hours and weary of watching the town shrink, <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Brzezinski </PERSON> threw in the towel on his Silver Spur Cafe 18 months ago, selling off the only restaurant in this dusty west <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> hamlet. Like the hardware store, the gas station, the grocery and so many others in so many towns in so many parts of rural <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, the Silver Spur soon failed, and <PERSON> Brzezinski </PERSON> figured <PERSON> Roby </PERSON> was n't far behind. But today, an unusual economic development plan has begun to breathe new life into this one-stoplight town. A new retirement center has opened, and because of aggressive promotion, coveys of quail hunters now flock to <LOCATION> Fisher </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>. Even the Silver Spur is going to shine again. <PERSON> Brzezinski </PERSON> is renovating the cafe and bringing it back from the dead this fall, convinced that the hungry hunters who come from 26 states for the four-month season will help the town of 814, and its only restaurant, survive. `` Our attitude has changed,'' he said. `` This is what has inspired me to do it again.'' What's happening in <LOCATION> Fisher </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> is held up across remote areas as an innovative approach to saving dying towns. Yet even here, after a handful of small successes, the future remains mostly bleak, and experts say the situation underscores just how difficult it is to revitalize rural <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. `` We have slowed the departure rate but, honestly, we have n't stopped it or reversed it,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Morris </PERSON>, chairman of the county's economic development commission `` All this is for naught unless we find the key to repopulating rural <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>.'' Three years ago, <LOCATION> Fisher </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>'s leaders declared a crisis: If they did n't do something, the county would die. Typical of small rural towns across the country, the population had already declined 44 percent over 10 years to just 5,000. Storefronts were boarded up. People, especially the young, moved to the cities. `` We were kind of desperate _ no doubt about it,'' said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Spencer </PERSON>, the county agriculture extension agent who brought together the local leaders. They rounded up state and national experts on economic development and sought their advice. They created the <ORGANIZATION> Fisher </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, and they made one key decision: Go for all the little projects they could think of, not one big project. `` Everyone thinks that <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> is going to come drop a factory in here or the B-2 -LRB- stealth bomber -RRB- program will drop in here. That does n't happen, and that's the common mistake rural people make,'' said <PERSON> Morris </PERSON>, a specialist on developing Third World nations who retired to run a motel here. The result has become a creative, if unconventional, model for rural economic development. `` They have less money and resources to work with, and yet after 10 years of decline, now they've got new money coming in,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Guarino </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION>, which has provided a grant for the quail hunting effort. `` If they can do it, you can do it all over.'' The commission has set out to revive this depressed cattle, cotton and oil area by promoting it as a retirement spot, drawing tourists and finding ways to keep citizens from leaving. Two commission members bought an abandoned nursing home and helped find new owners who have refurbished it. It's now the county's only retirement center _ even though 60 percent of the population is over age 55. Realizing <LOCATION> Fisher </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> had <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>' largest quail population, the commission formed a quail-hunting cooperative, which in its first year brought in 140 hunters and an estimated $ 100,000 of new spending. `` One hundred thousand dollars is an attention-getter in this town,'' said <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Atkinson </PERSON>, a Roby-based federal agriculture official who helps run the co-op. And in <LOCATION> Fisher </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, they'll try anything. The commission is hoping to build a memorial garden for slain police officers and turn an abandoned electric train depot into a museum to draw tourists. They're trying to raise money and serve the large poverty-level population with a food bank and used-clothing store. They've helped open a recreational vehicle park. The group even formed the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Domino </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> and played host to a first-ever national tournament. Not all of the ideas are working. The domino idea, while fun, has n't produced much money and will probably be cut back. The law enforcement monument has drawn a 15-acre land donation, but has only $ 400 in the bank. `` Time is short; doom is just around the corner,'' said the Rev. <PERSON> Alvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Petty </PERSON>, the leader of the commission's tourism task force. `` We've only got three or four more years to achieve a great deal because we're losing 8 percent of our population a year.'' Commission officials say they now know that their small-scale endeavors are simply setting the stage for necessary larger development. `` We have prepared the table, but we have n't gotten to the meat and potatoes,'' <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> said. And help will have to come from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, he believes, in the form of a modern Homestead Act that would once again encourage people to return to rural areas. `` Until we get that kind of public policy, the rest of this is <PERSON> Mickey </PERSON> <PERSON> Mouse </PERSON>. If they do n't put that structure in place, all of rural <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> will be blowing in the wind.''

 <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Cherry </PERSON> is going back to his roots; <LOCATION> Neneh </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cherry </LOCATION> is still developing hers. He moves and speaks in the rhythms of cool jazz, spontaneous and refined; she is warm and down-to-earth, with just a hint of the passion and hot funk generated by her hit single, `` Buffalo Stance.'' His peers include jazz greats <PERSON> Ornette </PERSON> <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> and <PERSON> Miles </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>; hers are such pop royalty as <PERSON> Prince </PERSON> and <PERSON> Madonna </PERSON>. But listen closely, and a similar spirit can be heard _ what <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Cherry </PERSON> might refer to as `` world music,'' or what <ORGANIZATION> Neneh </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cherry </ORGANIZATION> would call `` positive energy.'' <PERSON> Don </PERSON> is <PERSON> Neneh </PERSON>'s stepfather, and they share a common outlook on life and music. They talked recently about their music and lives in an interview at <ORGANIZATION> Neneh </ORGANIZATION>'s midtown <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> apartment. `` It's wonderful what's happening,'' said <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Cherry </PERSON>, the jazz trumpeter who has just released `` Art Deco,'' his first studio album of straight jazz in over two decades. `` The whole planet has this connection of music and sound. <LOCATION> Russia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> _ everyone's trying to express themselves. In the past three years, there's been a lot of energy and acceptance of things fresh.'' He includes Neneh's `` Raw Like Sushi'' album in that category. `` What Neneh's doing in music is what all people can relate to, the whole planet. There's a lot of things happening now that are a blessing. I hear <PERSON> Neneh </PERSON>'s songs on the radio, that's a blessing. And all of us feel that way. It's a new generation.'' The Cherrys trade compliments with ease and joy, celebrating their music and each other. <PERSON> Don </PERSON> sees <PERSON> Neneh </PERSON>'s career as a continuation of her happy upbringing. `` Neneh's always been a person to be with people,'' he said. `` She's always socialized. That's her karma. So many people are making records where they do everything, the drum parts and all. I do n't think Neneh could be like that, she enjoys working with people.'' <PERSON> Neneh </PERSON> was born in 1964 and grew up in <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, leaving school at age 14. After appearing in a number of underground bands, she began working on `` Raw Like Sushi'' last year. `` Music has always been natural to me,'' she said, `` but I did n't really make the decision to get involved with it until I was involved with working in a group. `` Music's always been there like a way of life, always. But I did n't start writing any material until I was out of two band situations. I took everything I had learned from the rest of my life and did something with it.'' `` Buffalo Stance'' combines rock, jazz, funk and disco. `` The best blessing I've had in my life is feeling I do n't have to define the various influences. ` Now we're going to do a reggae song, a jazz song.' In ` Cat on a Hot Tin Roof,' <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Newman </PERSON>'s saying, ` I need the click in my head, then I'll feel all right. `` At some point, a few years ago, I got that click. It's given me the freedom to make songs. We're in tune to where the raw energy is.'' `` The Next Generation'' is a track off `` Raw Sushi.'' <PERSON> Neneh </PERSON>, a mother of two, is already thinking of a world far removed from the dance floors where her music is heard. `` When you have a child, all of life and all children begin to matter in a different way,'' she said. `` It opened me up. Children are not being given the right information and they need to learn.'' `` You become aware of education,'' <PERSON> Don </PERSON> added. `` When <PERSON> Neneh </PERSON> was growing up, we started visiting schools ourselves; that's what education is. Not in material things, or this false love. The most important thing you can give kids is yourself.'' <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Cherry </PERSON>, born in 1936, grew up in the Watts section of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> and was soon exposed to <PERSON> Billie </PERSON> <PERSON> Holliday </PERSON>, <PERSON> Charlie </PERSON> <PERSON> Parker </PERSON> and other jazz legends. Like Neneh, music was more important than school, and he began cutting classes for the chance to jam with local musicians. He was just 17 when he started playing with <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON>, the alto sax player who helped develop free jazz, which relied on spontaneous interaction between musicians rather than extended solos. In the late 1950s, <PERSON> Cherry </PERSON> was part of the Coleman quartet whose engagement at <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s Five Spot Cafe attracted worldwide attention. He also played with <PERSON> Sonny </PERSON> <PERSON> Rollins </PERSON> and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Coltrane </PERSON> and made his first visit to the Third World in the mid -'60s, going from <LOCATION> Copenhagen </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Morocco </LOCATION>, and soon incorporated new sounds into his `` You look at the catalogs in the record stores,'' he said, `` the jazz department, new wave, fusion, new age. It's all coming together, it's world music. `` We're growing as listeners and as players, too. We've become more aware of what we have to work with. Jazz has gotten to be a gumbo. <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s a gumbo. It's good to know about each other's culture It's one of the greatest forms of education and it's happening in all of music. For `` Art Deco,'' he plays with just three other musicians, all longtime friends: tenor saxophonist <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Clay </PERSON>, bassist <PERSON> Charlie </PERSON> <PERSON> Haden </PERSON> and drummer <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>. They recorded 10 songs, including three <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> numbers -LRB- `` The Blessing,'' `` When Will the Blues Leave'' and `` Compute'' -RRB-, the standards `` Body and Soul'' and `` I've Grown Accustomed to Your Face,'' and the title track, a Cherry composition. `` It was a pleasure,'' he said. `` We had the best engineer in jazz -LRB- <PERSON> Rudy </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Gelder </PERSON> -RRB-, the producer -LRB- <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Snyder </PERSON> -RRB- had his heart in it and the musicians had been playing together. We played at the <ORGANIZATION> Village </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Vanguard </ORGANIZATION> for one week and at the end of the week we started recording. `` It's a pure jazz record.'' The Cherrys talk excitedly about working together and recording each other's material.

I'm in touch with myself and I'm getting to know myself more.

<TEXT>
 Like that friend of yours who regularly embarks on slim-and-trim diets, American industry is doing its thing again. It is seeking to slice poundage from its bureacracy, the better to court the consumer. Some of the biggest companies in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> are doing it. Usually a company is measured large because of its sales and earnings. In this instance, some of the them are large also because of their bulging midriffs. Faced with competition that seems to grow more intense as foreigners invade each other's markets, companies are cutting much of their excess baggage _ plants, products and people. Almost all the big-name companies, the kind that seek to sell worldwide, are doing it. Not all of them are American companies either. The currency advantage that once gave Japanese firms an edge in exports is greatly reduced now, so they must become even more efficient. <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> may become a vast common market in 1992, adding greatly to competitiveness there. But it's an old story in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. There was little industrial fat to be found in American companies right after World War II, but the easy days of the 1960s took care of that. Waste and inefficiency developed. By the 1970s, American companies were finding themselves at a competitive disadvantage. The industrial might of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, destroyed in the war, was much newer and more technologically efficient than American factories. The effect was shocking. The products of the bloated bureaucracies and dated factories of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> were undercut by foreign products shipped thousands of miles to showrooms. Foreign quality steadily improved while <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s fell. That shocking experience brought on a crash diet. Old factories were closed. Layers of white-collar workers were eliminated. Billions of dollars were spent on new production facilities. Nonessential units were sold off. That desperate diet of the 1970s had much to do with the success of American business in the 1980s. But success, it seems, has its dangers, the worst of them complacency. Bureaucratic baggage has accreted again. No company, no matter how great its reputation, is immune: Oldtimers such as <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and the Big Three automakers, post-war phenoms such as <ORGANIZATION> Digital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Equipment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, and upstart <ORGANIZATION> Apple </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Computer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. After a terrible start, the decade of the 1980s has the appearance of the 1960s all over The economy has grown, unemployment has dropped and inflation and interest rates are under control again. And the fat has developed. Just 10 years after having been rescued from the edge of bankruptcy, and after having cut expenses to the bone, <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> is now forced to go on crash diet that, it hopes, will save $ 1 billion by the end of 1990. The proposed cuts reveal where the fat had grown: <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION>'s white-collar work force, up about 50 percent in six years, would be reduced by 2,300 staffers Cost cuts in materials would be sought. Production would be streamlined. There is nothing new in such goals. In theory, such efficiencies are part of the unrelenting pursuit of good management. In practice, especially when times are comfortable, both theory and practice fall into disuse. What awakens both of them is competition, and competiton now is global rather than regional or national. The route to the consumer's heart is n't is nationality but price and quality. Only the slimmest and trimmest can offer it.

 The courts turned him down. Wall Street turned its back on him. So Paramount Chairman <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> scrapped his $ 12.2 billion hostile offer for Time, vindicating the media giant's plan to merge with <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> But the story of <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>'s seven-week-long struggle for <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> did not end last week when <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> dropped his bid and <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> completed its $ 14 billion tender offer for <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. The next chapters _ revealing what happens to these three sprawling entertainment-communications companies _ will unfold months and years from now. Time Chairman <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Munro </PERSON> is both optimistic and cautious about the future of the company that will be known as <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` We've got nothing but healthy businesses,'' he said. `` We've acquired a company that's on an incredible roll. Nonetheless, <PERSON> Munro </PERSON>'s company also has taken on an estimated $ 13 billion in debt to complete the deal. That will crimp some of <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION>'s plans. `` This is going to make it a little tougher on us,'' <PERSON> Munro </PERSON> said in a telephone interview. `` We are going to probably not be as aggressive as we might be without that debt.'' Time's plans overseas _ which it hoped to expand through the <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> deal _ could be limited because of the amount of money the company owes. `` Some of that will take capital we wo n't have,'' <PERSON> Munro </PERSON> said. `` Some things we would have liked to have done will take a little longer to get to.'' After Paramount launched its bid, some observers theorized <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> did not actually want to acquire Time _ and knew he'd fail _ but hoped to sabotage <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION>'s competitive advantage. Regardless of <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>' motivation, `` he did force Time to acquire <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> through debt rather than stock,'' said <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Anschel </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Dean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Witter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reynolds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` It does limit <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION>'s financial flexibility over the next year or two.'' Paramount's offer forced Time and <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> to transform their planned stock-swap merger into a $ 70 a share tender offer by <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION>. The only way Time could pay for <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION>'s 200 million shares was to borrow. But <PERSON> Munro </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ross </PERSON>, who will co-run the company, evidently do n't expect debt to slow them down too much. `` You chew on the debt not by cutting creativity or firing people, but by growth,'' <PERSON> Munro </PERSON> said. First on <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION>'s agenda is to decide the breakdown of cash and securities it will exchange for the 98 million <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> shares not purchased in the cash tender offer _ what's known as the `` back end'' of the merger. The amount of cash involved and how much, if any, debt securities Time issues will help determine the size of <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION>'s debt load. Time and <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> expect to repay that debt through cash flow, an accounting term that refers to the money generated by their business. But while the companies stated in June that no asset sales were planned as a result of the merger, they sound less resolute now that they've got a done deal. Published reports have said Time and <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> were considering selling Time's <PERSON> Scott </PERSON>, <PERSON> Foresman </PERSON> book publisher and <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION>'s cable television operations. <PERSON> Munro </PERSON> said he could not imagine a sale of either business, but added, `` We really do n't know what we're going to do until we get the back end together and refine the cash flows.'' `` We would try very hard not to sell assets,'' <PERSON> Munro </PERSON> said. `` We'll know within six months.'' Some observers doubt whether <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> and <PERSON> Munro </PERSON>, two strong personalities, will be able to get along sharing the top job. `` That will be determined, but we know each other awful well,'' <PERSON> Munro </PERSON> said. Both executives negotiated the merger, resolving differences over two years of talks, and weathered <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION>'s assault on their plans. <PERSON> Munro </PERSON> claimed the pair `` survived that without one harsh word.'' <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> has served as a co-chief executive once before. He shared the top spot at <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> with <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Frankel </PERSON> from 1967 until <PERSON> Frankel </PERSON>'s death in 1971. `` We're putting together two companies that are so healthy, it makes it easier,'' <PERSON> Munro </PERSON> said. `` The debt makes it a bit more difficult, but we really feel that's manageable.'' Analysts believe the debt will cushion <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> from any hostile bids, at least for a while. But plenty of speculation remains about what will happen to <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION>, which has an enormous amount of cash. Only a few days after the failed bid for Time, <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION> sold its financial services business to <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> for $ 3.35 billion, strengthening its ability to buy other companies. `` It's simply a question of who they're going to go after and, if they do n't, who's going to go after them,'' said <PERSON> Anschel </PERSON>, the Dean <PERSON> Witter </PERSON> analyst. Paramount Chairman <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> was undaunted in defeat, although his aggressive run at <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> flopped last week before the highest court in <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION>, where all three companies are incorporated. The three-judge <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> panel upheld a lower court ruling that affirmed Time's right to pursue its long-sought merger with <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> and told <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION> it had no business interfering. `` We believe in making bold moves when they are in the best interest of <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> shareholders,'' <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> stated after the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruled. `` We have just demonstrated that in our offer for Time ...'' <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION> would continue its expansion plans through acquisitions, mergers, joint ventures or partnerships. But analysts have predicted his future targets would be on a smaller scale than Time. The company refused to comment on the possibility that it could find itself the target of suitor. During the seven weeks that Time and <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> fought Paramount, the stock market was rife with rumors that bidders would emerge for any or all of the three combatants. Their stock prices gyrated as the reports came and went, but no bids were announced. Still, the failure of <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION>'s bid is an interesting study of how Wall Street itself studies an offer. After Paramount announced its bid on June 6, the stock market bid Time shares up from $ 126 to a high of $ 182.75. But professional speculators and their own lawyers assessed <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION>'s chances and saw that <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> would lose _ and began to dump their Time holdings. As the weeks wore on, <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> stock spiraled downward, reaching about $ 136 as the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> heard the final arguments in the case.

<HEAD>Bad Week For American Automakers and the UAW</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICK GLADSTONE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Autoworker unionists in <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> and automaker executives in <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> are finding they have a lot in common: Both know what it's like to get their snouts snapped by <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Auto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> union suffered a stunning defeat this past week at the <ORGANIZATION> Nissan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> plant in <LOCATION> Smyrna </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>, where workers voted 2-to-1 to reject <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION> representation despite an intensive and often bitter union campaign that began in January 1988. Not only did the rejection signal a repudiation of the <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Union Yes'' drive at the 6-year-old plant, but it also was seen as a sign that American workers are increasingly accepting Japanese management techniques <ORGANIZATION> Nissan </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Smyrna </LOCATION> workers, who produce light trucks and Sentra sedans, make the same money as <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION> counterparts elsewhere and none has ever been laid off, making it difficult for the union to find an effective campaign issue. The <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION> blamed the defeat on what it called <ORGANIZATION> Nissan </ORGANIZATION>'s systematic anti-union rhetoric. The vote was big news in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, where companies that rely heavily on sales in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> market, particularly automakers, have been building more factories in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, both to thwart charges of trade protectionism and to gain a stronger presence in this country. So far, no transplanted Japanese auto factory has been organized by the <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION>, and the <LOCATION> Smyrna </LOCATION> vote intensified speculation that the country's largest union will face more trouble plugging the holes in its declining membership. The union was n't the only one smarting from <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s influence on the automaking industry. Five hundred miles north of <LOCATION> Smyrna </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>, two of the Big Three reported lower second-quarter earnings because of declining domestic sales, and a third announced a $ 1 billion cost-cutting effort, partly the result of aggressive Japanese competition. <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> said earnings fell 3 percent from a year earlier to $ 1.45 billion, and <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> said earnings fell 15 percent to $ 1.4 billion. Industry analysts said the rebates offered by the carmakers not only failed to lure enough buyers but eroded whatever earnings were left. <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> which is to report earnings Monday, confronted perhaps a more serious problem of growing costs, evoking memories of gloomy days several years ago when the company needed federal loan guarantees to stay alive. The No. 3 automaker's chairman <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Iacocca </PERSON>, widely credited with resurrecting <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION>, told top managers the company was too fat and they needed to cut 2,300 white-collar workers from the payroll by yearend. A slump in the auto business has been expected for a while, and many industry analysts foresee drastically lower earnings at the Big Three over the remainder of 1989 and perhaps 1990. The automakers themselves have indicated they agree with that assessment. In one telling sign this past week, <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> bought <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>'s profitable financial services business for $ 3.35 billion cash. The purchase was seen as part of <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>'s attempt to protect itself from dependence on selling cars to make money. Elsewhere in business and economic news this past week: _ Bigger evidently is better in the drug business <ORGANIZATION> Bristol-Myers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Squibb </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> agreed to merge in a stock swap valued at about $ 11 billion, creating one of the largest pharmaceutical companies. The agreement came a day after <ORGANIZATION> SmithKline </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beckman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Beecham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION> completed their previously announced merger. _ <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> completed its merger with <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> after <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION>'s highest court blocked Paramount Communication's hostile takeover attempt of The court's decision was seen as a major victory for corporate directors whose long-term plans may conflict with the wishes of shareholders. _ More evidence of a slowing economy emerged, boosting stock and bond prices The government said its broadest measure of economic growth showed a 1.7 percent gain this spring, well below expectations. Economists said the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION>, which has taken steps to ease credit, would likely continue to do so in order to avert a possible recession. _ <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> said the cost of cleaning the Alaskan oil spill would exceed $ 1.25 billion and was responsible for a plunge in its second-quarter earnings The disclosure coincided with a five-month low in the price of oil, which had been driven higher by fears of shortages that followed the March 24 spill.

<TEXT>
 After a long time circling the runway on dwindling power, the once high-flying economy finally may be touching down. Stock market investors have braced for a possibly difficult landing by favoring companies that can turn a profit regardless of economic conditions and dumping ones apt to be bumped around during impact. The economy probably started on its final approach to the runway during the second quarter when growth eased considerably to a 1.7 percent annual pace. Many analysts regarded the report issued this past week on the gross national product _ the broadest gauge of economic activity _ as a signal that the economy has sufficient power for the sought-after `` soft landing,'' a period of slow but sustained growth with falling inflation and interest rates. This analysis helped various stock market measures scale to record heights during the week. On Friday, the <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Poor's 500-stock index climbed to 342.15 and the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> composite index advanced to 190.38, both all-time highs For all of the week, the market made some impressive progress. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials finished the week at 2,635.24, just 0.19 point below the post-crash high reached Thursday, up 27.88 points for the week and just about 87 points shy of its all time high of 2,722.42 set in August 1987. The <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION> composite index rose 3.23 to 190.38; the <ORGANIZATION> NASDAQ </ORGANIZATION> composite index for the over-the-counter market added 3.53 to 452.82; and, the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> market value index was up 3.23 at 374.51. Volume on the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> averaged 179.62 million shares a day, up slightly from 175.90 million a day the previous week. One force driving the market onward was evidence that the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> was fluffing the credit cushion to make the economy's landing more comfortable. The central bank took steps this past week to loosen short-term interest rates. Declining interest rates bode well for the stock and bond markets, says <PERSON> Greg </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Prudential-Bache </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. Hundreds of billions of dollars now invested in money market funds in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> could go elsewhere if rates continue to fall. `` Any further drops in short-term interest rates as the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> shifts policy for recession prevention could also unleash a fairly powerful flow of money into longer-term financial assets such as stocks and bonds,'' he wrote in a weekly market strategy report. A look at recent Wall Street trends indicates investors have been discriminating in their selections. Stocks of companies with earnings swings during business cycles, such as automakers, have performed weakly for some time while more recession-proof companies, such as foodmakers and consumer product companies, have fared better. `` The market is really penalizing those companies that will be bothered by a recession,'' says <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Connolly </PERSON>, of <ORGANIZATION> Dean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Witter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reynolds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. But <PERSON> Connolly </PERSON> says he sees two chief reasons why a sluggish economic growth wo n't deteriorate into a serious downturn, with widespread layoffs and significant income shrinkage. Most importantly, he says, the central bank has ample leeway to lower interest rates without stirring up inflation. `` There's no reason why the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> has to stay tight,'' says <PERSON> Connolly </PERSON>. `` In prior recessions, the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> felt it could n't loosen because it's job on inflation was n't working.'' The second safeguard is that consumers already have made major progress in replenishing their savings depleted during the longest economic expansion in the post-World War II era, <PERSON> Connolly </PERSON> contends. A government report released Friday showed the personal savings rate _ savings as a percent of disposable income _ rose to 5.9 percent in June, well above the sub-3-percent rates that prevailed a few years ago. `` Part of the function of a recession is to reliquify the consumer,'' says <PERSON> Connolly </PERSON>. `` The consumer is already partially reliquified.''

 <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> is lowering its prime lending rate to 10 -LCB- percent because of its own declining borrowing costs and further signs of a weakening economy, and analysts say other banks should quickly follow. The move, effective Monday, follows <ORGANIZATION> Chase </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manhattan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>, which dropped its prime on July 10 by the same half percentage point. The decline was the second in as many months, bringing the prime rate to the level at which it stood at the start of 1989. Analysts said they expected most other major banks to quickly lower their prime to the same level. <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> is the nation's second-largest bank. `` They were n't the first and they wo n't be the last,'' said stock analyst <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Fredericks </PERSON> with <ORGANIZATION> Montgomery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> chief economist <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> cited the falling federal funds rate _ the rate banks charge each other for overnight loans _ and signs of a slowing economy as the main reasons for the move, which was announced Friday. The prime, a laggard among other interest rates, is a benchmark banks use to set interest on a variety of consumer and business credit, including home-equity lines of credit. It also determines the rate for many credit cards. <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> has shown signs of loosening its grip on the nation's money supply in reaction to a continued slowdown in economic growth and an easing of inflation. Analysts expected most major banks to follow <ORGANIZATION> Chase </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manhattan </ORGANIZATION>'s lead in lowering their prime rate once they were certain the federal funds rate would remain near or below 9 percent, thereby confirming the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION>'s policy to depress interest rates The rate was 815-16 percent late Friday. Reflecting banks' continued dropping costs of funds, the average yield on six-month certificates of deposit fell to a national average of 8.47 percent last week, compared with 8.52 percent the previous week and the 8.8 percent range in late June, according to the newsletter Bank Rate Monitor. In the bond market, another indicator of general interest rate trends, the yield on the 30-year <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bond finished at about 7.98 percent Friday, its first close below 8 percent since April 8, 1987. <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> said the bank's second reason for lowering its prime was the week's economic news `` shows definitely that the economy is slowing down.'' A slowdown in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economy tends to ease the risk of inflation, thus allowing the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> to pursue a strategy of reducing interest rates. <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> cited reports on Friday by the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> that personal incomes rose a lackluster 0.3 percent in June as consumer spending _ which accounts for two-thirds of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economic activity _ declined for a second straight month. He also cited two months of negative growth in industrial production. `` With this kind of interest rate and economic news across the board, I'd expect the money center banks and big regional banks to do the same _ soon,'' said banking analyst <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Abrahms </PERSON> of <PERSON> Bateman </PERSON> <PERSON> Eichler </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Hill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Richards </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>.
