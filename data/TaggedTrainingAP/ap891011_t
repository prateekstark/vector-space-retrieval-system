<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> expressed concern Wednesday about a new crackdown by Panamanian authorities on civil liberties, while President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> tried to end the recriminations with key members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> that followed last week's failed coup attempt. Department spokeswoman <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON> said a `` package of war laws'' is being decreed by the the Panamanian government as part of an effort to `` eliminate the last vestiges of democracy and rule of law.'' As an example, she said civil servants could be fired for disloyalty under the new measures being planned and the right of habeas corpus is to be eliminated. `` These war laws purportedly will strip Panamanians of their remaining civil liberties and human rights,'' she said. Meanwhile, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> summoned Sen. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Boren </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Okla </LOCATION>., the chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, and Sen. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> <PERSON> R-Maine </PERSON>, the vice chairman, following a week of congressional criticism about the way the administration handled the abortive uprising In a statement issued afterward, <PERSON> Boren </PERSON> indicated that the meeting was designed, in part, to avoid a repeat of the snafus that occurred during the abortive uprising last week in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. `` I feel that our discussion, which focused on intelligence matters, will be of great help to our country if we ever confront crises like the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> situation in the future,'' <PERSON> Boren </PERSON> said. Afterward, <PERSON> Boren </PERSON> flew to <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> and was unavailable to elaborate on his statement. Wednesday night, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> brushed off any hint of bad feeling over the congressional criticism he got on the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> matter, saying criticism was to be expected always, and said he had an amiable meeting with <PERSON> Boren </PERSON> and <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON>. `` There was never any bad blood,'' he told reporters at a state dinner in honor of Italian President <PERSON> Francesco </PERSON> <PERSON> Cossiga </PERSON>. `` I'm not angry,'' he said in response to reports that he heatedly chastised his staff and laid down the law that there was to be no more second-guessing. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> predicted that as the smoke clears people will agree with him. `` I have no second guesses at all, `` he said. Administration officials have said that poor communications and confused signals contributed to the failure of the coup attempt. Wednesday's meeting occurred three days after <PERSON> Boren </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> adviser <PERSON> Brent </PERSON> <PERSON> Scowcroft </PERSON> clashed over whether <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> restrictions inhibited the administration's ability to fulfill its goal of ousting <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. Vice President <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said the meeting with the senators concluded with everyone `` on the same wave length. I believe it was a very good, productive meeting.'' But on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> aimed new criticism at the administration for seeking to blame its inaction on congressionally imposed constraints. `` The efforts by some within the administration to shift responsibility for decisions ... to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> are ill-founded, unfair and counterproductive,'' said <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Maine </LOCATION>. It is legitimate, he said, for <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to inquire into `` how the administration could have been so unprepared when what it had long been urging took place.'' At the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, Ms. <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON> denied assertions by some rebel leaders who have been given sanctuary in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> that the insurgents were promised much more support by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> than was actually given. She specifically denied that the rebels had asked for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> air support to prevent the airlifting of pro-Noriega reinforcements to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> after the coup attempt got under way. Ms. <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON> said that Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> was disturbed by unnamed <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials quoted in newspaper accounts as being critical of other agencies involved in the events last week in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. She said <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> told a staff meeting last Friday he wanted to see a stop to such criticism. Meanwhile, seven Latin American presidents, meeting in <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>, discussed the proposed expulsion of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> from an eight-member hemispheric consultative group. <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s membership was suspended in 1988 after <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> arranged the dismissal of President <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON>, who had tried to fire <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> as military commander. <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION> are among members pushing for <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s expulsion `` We can not permit a country like <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> that scoffs at and ridicules the democratic system to contnue with us,'' said <PERSON> Guillermo </PERSON> <PERSON> Larco </PERSON> <PERSON> Cox </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>'s foreign minister. Diplomatic sources said <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and some others felt expulsion would amount to interference in the internal affairs of another country.

<HEAD>Board Recommends Delaying PLO Request Until 1991</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The executive board of <ORGANIZATION> UNESCO </ORGANIZATION> recommended Wednesday that the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>'s request for admission to the agency be put off until 1991. The recommendation goes to <ORGANIZATION> UNESCO </ORGANIZATION>'s highest decision-making body, the General Conference, which begins a monthlong meeting Tuesday. If the conference takes the board's advice, as appears likely, <ORGANIZATION> UNESCO </ORGANIZATION> will be following the footsteps of the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, which decided in May to put off considering whether to admit <LOCATION> Palestine </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>'s parliament-in-exile from its headquarters in <LOCATION> Tunis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tunisia </LOCATION>, last Nov. 15 declared <LOCATION> Palestine </LOCATION> as an independent state without giving specific boundaries. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, which withdrew from <ORGANIZATION> UNESCO </ORGANIZATION> nearly five years ago, had said it would not consider returning if Palestine were admitted as a member state. At the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> meeting in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> had threatened to withhold paying its contribution to the budget, which amounts to 25 percent. The resolution approved by the <ORGANIZATION> UNESCO </ORGANIZATION> board without debate or a vote called for close involvement of the Palestinians in activities of the 159-nation <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Educational </ORGANIZATION>, Scientific and Cultural Organization. The Palestinian observer at <ORGANIZATION> UNESCO </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Omar </PERSON> <PERSON> Massalha </PERSON>, said the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> decided to accept the recommendation for postponement in order to spare the agency any political confrontation over the issue. <ORGANIZATION> UNESCO </ORGANIZATION> Director-General <PERSON> Federico </PERSON> <PERSON> Mayor </PERSON> has made a determined effort to get the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION> to rejoin the world body. The Americans and British left because they said the organization had become too political, spent too much money and was poorly managed. <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION> pulled out saying it could spend its dues better elsewhere. The resolution calls for the `` closest possible participation of <LOCATION> Palestine </LOCATION> in the action of <ORGANIZATION> UNESCO </ORGANIZATION>, in particular through its programs and full benefits of the scholarship programs.'' It says the Palestine observer mission now can make requests to participate in <ORGANIZATION> UNESCO </ORGANIZATION> programs directly instead of going through the <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> as it has in the past. Mayor has drawn up an 82-page study for the board outlining ways the Palestinians can become involved more closely in <ORGANIZATION> UNESCO </ORGANIZATION> activities.

 Panamanian rebels involved in last week's failed coup attempt never intended to kill Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> when they held him captive briefly, said one of the coup leaders seeking political asylum here. Among 42 Panamanians the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> flew to <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> on Saturday was Capt. <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Licona </PERSON>, believed to be the highest-ranking coup participant to escape capture, said a <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration official speaking on condition of anonymity. `` We're working with the immigration service so that they can remain here, _ those that want to file for asylum,'' <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Franken </PERSON>, a refugee coordinator for the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION>, said Wednesday. `` I expect that will take about a week.'' <PERSON> Adela </PERSON> <PERSON> Bonilla </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Giroldi </PERSON>, widow of the major who led the unsuccessful coup, also was among those airlifted to <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>. She told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> the coup was betrayed by another officer who switched sides at the last minute. She said her husband, Maj. <PERSON> Moises </PERSON> <PERSON> Giroldi </PERSON> <PERSON> Vega </PERSON>, had worked with Maj. <PERSON> Francisco </PERSON> <PERSON> Olechea </PERSON>, commander of the elite Battalion 2000, in planning the coup. Battalion 2000, instead of fighting <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, was airlifted 55 miles from the fighting and led <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s troops to crush the coup. `` Everything was ready. But <PERSON> Olechea </PERSON> was playing a winner's game and he failed to come through because of his cowardice,'' she told the Times in a <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> interview. <PERSON> Franken </PERSON> said the Panamanians flown into <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> have told him they want to remain in seclusion for now. But administration officials are said to be attempting to get more information from the leaders secluded here. One rebel leader said that during the daylong coup attempt on Oct. 3, the rebels held <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> hostage for several hours and could have killed him at any time, The <ORGANIZATION> Miami </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION> reported Wednesday. The rebel, who spoke on condition that neither his name nor the location where he was interviewed be disclosed, said his troops knew him as `` Commandante Trueno'' _ Commander Thunder. He said junior officers who took part in the coup attempt turned <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> over to their superiors, but that leaders of the rebellion had no desire to kill the general. `` There was no intention at any time to kill the man,'' Commander Thunder said. When asked why, he said it may have been because a soldier would find it hard to execute his top commander. `` It may have been their military discipline,'' he said. Mrs. <PERSON> Giroldi </PERSON> told the Times that three captains who were supposed to persuade <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> to surrender `` did n't do it because they were cowards.'' `` My husband could have killed <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, but he would not do that. He thought the commander's fate should be decided by the people,'' not the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, she told the paper. In their public proclamations, the rebels said they had staged the coup to `` retire'' <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> and five senior colonels of the Panamanian <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION>. With Commander Thunder were about a dozen other rebel troops seeking political asylum. He said they would make no statement as they waited to hear what their fate would be. `` We do n't want to say anything at this time,'' Commander Thunder said. `` We are awaiting orders.'' Family members of slain coup leader Maj. <PERSON> Moises </PERSON> <PERSON> Giroldi </PERSON> also were in the group, <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Rich </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanders </PERSON> said. He would not confirm whether the group included <PERSON> Giroldi </PERSON>'s widow, <PERSON> Adela </PERSON> <PERSON> Bonilla </PERSON> <PERSON> Giroldi </PERSON>, a key intermediary between <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials and the coup plotters. Earlier, one of the group said the soldiers feared for their relatives at home. `` <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> is a beast,'' said the man, who also asked not to be identified. `` He wo n't stop at anything. He's going to take reprisals against our wives, our children and our parents back in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>.''

 Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> accused the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> on Wednesday of trying to keep its forces in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> to maintain control over <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. The widow of the Panamanian major who led an unsuccessful coup against <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> says it failed because her husband was betrayed by another major who switched sides at the last minute, according to a published report. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, who blamed last week's coup attempt on the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, said <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> must be prepared `` because they can not catch us by surprise again, and even if the commander -LRB- <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> -RRB- falls, the people will not fall.'' Countering what <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials have been saying, <PERSON> Adela </PERSON> <PERSON> Bonilla </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Giroldi </PERSON> was quoted by the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> in Thursday's editions as saying the coup was `` very well organized and coldly calculated.'' She said her husband, Maj. <PERSON> Moises </PERSON> <PERSON> Giroldi </PERSON> <PERSON> Vega </PERSON>, worked with Maj. <PERSON> Francisco </PERSON> <PERSON> Olechea </PERSON>, commander of the elite Battalion 2000, in planning the coup. Instead of being used to oust <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, however, Battalion 2000 was airlifted 55 miles from the scene of the fighting and led <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s troops in crushing the coup. `` Everything was ready. But <PERSON> Olechea </PERSON> was playing a winner's game and he failed to come through because of his cowardice,'' she told the Times in an interview in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>. Mrs. <PERSON> Giroldi </PERSON> was not at military headquarters during the coup attempt on Oct. 3 and her information came from officers who took part in the coup and, as she did, fled shortly afterwards to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, the Times said. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> spoke in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> at the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> assembly </ORGANIZATION>. Before he addressed the crowd, he introduced <PERSON> Sarah </PERSON> <PERSON> York </PERSON>, 11, a <LOCATION> Negaunee </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>, girl on her second trip to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> at <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s invitation `` She represents the truth of the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people, purity and not hatred,'' he said as he brought his young pen pal to the podium to wave to the crowd. The assembly is comprised of precinct representatives appointed by the government to act as a legislative body. It replaces the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>, which was abolished when the provisional government of President <PERSON> Francisco </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> took office on Sept. 1. The government annulled May 7 elections, which foreign observers say the opposition won by a 3-1 margin. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, who commands the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> and controls the government, said <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s intention was not just to eliminate him, `` but to install in power the enemies of the people.'' <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> spoke after <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. He called for reconciliation and said his government was open to dialogue. On Tuesday, the government announced tough new measures aimed at suppressing dissent, firing public employees considered to be disloyal, freezing wages and suspending year-end bonuses. Members of the assembly demanded dismissal of `` seditious'' elements still working for the government. But <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON>, who was frequently rumored to have opposed the laws during Cabinet meetings, said the measures should not be used for personal revenge. `` The preservation of the country as our home is and must be the paramount goal of our government,'' <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> said. Opposition leaders and members of professional associations expressed concern over impact of the new laws, which the government said were meant to `` protect the economy and national security in the face of <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. aggression.'' `` It is the first step in the creation of a police state,'' <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Ricardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> <PERSON> Calderon </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> Wednesday that <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> was decreeing a `` package of war laws'' as part of an effort to `` eliminate the last vestiges of democracy and rule of law.'' <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> blames <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> for its troubles. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government imposed economic sanctions on <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> after <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> was indicted in February 1988 on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> drug charges. He denies the charges. Wednesday was the 21st anniversary of the military coup that brought to power the late <PERSON> Omar </PERSON> <PERSON> Torrijos </PERSON>, the man <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> considers his political and ideological mentor. The coup deposed President <PERSON> Arnulfo </PERSON> <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> 11 days after <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> took office. <PERSON> Torrijos </PERSON> banned political parties, exiled scores of politicians and ruled with the help of a <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> instead of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Torrijos </PERSON> signed treaties with President <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> that committed the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to a new relationship with <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> gave up its territory in the Canal Zone in 1979. Under the treaties, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> must close its <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> bases at the end of the century, when <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> will take over the Canal's administration.

 Police action against cocaine suppliers is futile unless the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> reduce the demand that drives the illicit trade, President <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Andres </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION> said Wednesday. Perez spoke on opening day of a summit of seven Latin American presidents in this desert city that also is to consider expelling <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> as the eighth member of the Group of Eight regional organization. <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s membership was suspended in 1988 after Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> arranged the dismissal of President <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON>, who had tried to fire <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> as military commander. The Venezuelan leader called <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s military rule a `` masked dictatorship.'' President <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION> used his opening remarks to `` express publicly the Peruvian people's and the Peruvian government's repudiation and condemnation of the military dictatorship.'' <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION> were expected to push for expulsion of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, but diplomatic sources said <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and some other members felt that would amount to meddling with the internal affairs of another country. Among items on the summit's agenda besides drug trafficking are <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s conflicts, foreign debt and environmental damage to the <LOCATION> Amazon </LOCATION> jungle. In his remarks on the drug trade, <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> said: `` The more demand grows in the north, the more production will grow in the south. Police actions will be useless unless demand is reduced.'' Other opening statements also expressed support for <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION>, which argue that President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s emphasis on attacking the cocaine traffic at the source is not enough. The summit began the day after Presidents <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON>, <PERSON> Virgilio </PERSON> <PERSON> Barco </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Jaime </PERSON> <PERSON> Paz </PERSON> <PERSON> Zamora </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION> invited <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to attend a drug summit in <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> within 90 days. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> accepted immediately. <PERSON> Paz </PERSON> did not remain for the Group of Eight meeting because <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION> is not a member. <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> and <PERSON> Barco </PERSON> were joined by <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Gortari </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Sarney </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Menem </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Julio </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanguinetti </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Uruguay </LOCATION> at the third summit since the regional organization was formed in 1987. The meeting is being conducted in closed session at the Hotel Las Dunas on the outskirts of <ORGANIZATION> Ica </ORGANIZATION>, a city of 350,000 people 185 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION>. Officials said earlier that the meeting would last three days, but late Wednesday shortened the meeting to two days without giving a reason. An army battlion of 300 soldiers guarded the hotel and 3,000 plaincothes policemen circulated in the city in case of attacks by <ORGANIZATION> Shining </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Path </ORGANIZATION>, a Maoist guerrilla group that began fighting Peruvian governments in 1980. The insurgency has cost 15,000 lives by government count. A car bomb police blamed on Shining Path exploded Tuesday night outside an auto parts store in residential <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION>, wounding a guard and blowing out the windows of the shop and nearby buildings. Police said rebels also shot and killed a woman candidate for deputy mayor of a <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION> district Tuesday night, firing three bullets into her head as she stood behind the counter of her pharmacy. Official reports said 26 other people were killed in seven incidents Tuesday night and Wednesday, including nine policemen, two mayors and two rural mayoral candidates. Diplomatic sources at the summit said the presidents were expected to give full support to <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION> in their fight against traffickers. <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> began a crackdown on cocaine gangs Aug. 19. On Tuesday, <PERSON> Barco </PERSON>, <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> and <PERSON> Paz </PERSON> promised `` all-out war'' on cocaine in their countries, which produce 90 percent of the world's supply Their communique stressed that stopping the cocaine trade must be accompanied by vigorous efforts against production and consumption. That reflects reservations in <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> about <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s emphasis on police and military actions to stop trafficking in the Andean nations President <PERSON> Sanguinetti </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Uruguay </LOCATION> told reporters before the summit began Wednesday: `` The problem is not only in <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION>. It is also in the streets of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>.'' His reference was to the <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> drug cartel, which has been at war with the <LOCATION> Colombian </LOCATION> government since the crackdown began in August. The three-nation communique did not elaborate on differences of approach, but <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> have requested more <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economic aid to provide alternative sources of income for hundreds of thousands of peasants who live by growing coca, the raw material for cocaine. `` It's not a problem of donating some helicopters, sometimes very old helicopters, or donating rifles or bullets,'' <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> said recently. `` It would be enough to offer a good price and a guaranted market for the products that could substitute for coca.'' He, Barco and <PERSON> Paz </PERSON> also said <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> leaders should attend the drug summit. <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> has said that, if the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is successful in slowing the flow of cocaine across its borders, traffickers will shift their focus to <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>.

Officially named the Sovereign Military Order of the <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> John </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jerusalem </ORGANIZATION>, of <PERSON> Rhodes </PERSON> and of <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION>, the knights are the oldest order of chivalry and the fourth oldest religious order in the <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>. They ruled this rocky and almost barren <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> archipelago from 1530, when Emperor <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> V </PERSON> gave it to them for the price of one trained falcon a year, until 1798 when <PERSON> Napoleon </PERSON> sent them packing without the treasures they acquired during centuries of plundering the Ottoman Empire. Fra <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Bertie </PERSON>, the 78th grand master of the 900-year-old order, has summoned the knights back and has urged them to help <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION> improve its economy. For centuries, membership in the knights required proof of generations of nobility. Although some ranks today are open to those without noble ancestry, the rolls are still crowded with the wealthy and influential. The <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> financier <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Grace </PERSON> is a member, as are former <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Secretary of State <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Haig </PERSON>, Premier <PERSON> Giulio </PERSON> <PERSON> Andreotti </PERSON> and President <PERSON> Francesco </PERSON> <PERSON> Cossiga </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Giovanni </PERSON> <PERSON> Agnelli </PERSON>, chairman of the Italian automobile company <ORGANIZATION> Fiat </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> attorney and owner of the <ORGANIZATION> Baltimore </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Orioles </ORGANIZATION> major league baseball team who died in August 1988, also was a member. Such men are one reason the order's Maltese association asked <PERSON> Bertie </PERSON> to call the knights back to <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION>, which in 25 years of independence from <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> has found the economic road as rocky as its coastline. <PERSON> Bertie </PERSON>, a long-time former resident of <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION>, encourged knights worldwide to attend the first world gathering of the order and openly solicited their help. `` I also urge those of you who are directly or indirectly interested in facilitating contacts with the development of the economic life of the island to do so,'' <PERSON> Bertie </PERSON> told the knights earlier this year in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Giorgio </PERSON>, president of the Maltese association of the ancient order now based in <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>, said about 500 of the 10,000 members are expected to travel to <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION>. `` We want knights from around the world to exchange ideas about our hospital work and to rediscover <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Giorgio </PERSON>. `` During the 268 years the knights were here, they introduced new thinking in architecture, law, medicine and merchant shipping.'' The knights made <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION> a thriving center of Christianity and trade. <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Giorgio </PERSON> said the knights also gave <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION> the legal codes that are the basis for much of its modern law. In 1575, they built and then operated what then was one of the largest hospitals in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. They gave <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION> an architectural heritage of massive fortifications and magnificent palaces and churches. The knights today operate about 200 hospitals and first aid centers in 90 countries, especially in the Third World and war zones. The order was founded in the late 11th century with the opening of a hospice for pilgrims in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>. Its centuries-old dedication to hospital work began when it treated the sick and wounded after the army of the First Crusade captured <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> in 1099. It first took up arms in the 12th century to defend the pilgrim routes to the Holy Land. In the late 13th century, after the Holy Land fell to the Moslems, the knights moved first to <LOCATION> Cyrpus </LOCATION> and then to <LOCATION> Rhodes </LOCATION> where they built a navy to fight the Moslem Ottoman Empire. <PERSON> Sultan </PERSON> <PERSON> Suleiman </PERSON> the Magnificent defeated the knights and forced them to leave <PERSON> Rhodes </PERSON> on Jan. 1, 1523, although with huge losses to his troops. Seven years later, the knights resumed the fight from <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION>. Once again <PERSON> Suleiman </PERSON> attacked. This time 600 knights, 1,230 mostly Spanish soldiers and about 6,000 Maltese militia defeated an Ottoman army of 40,000. That victory in 1565 marked the beginning of the end for Ottoman seapower and earned the knights the gratitude of a threatened <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 On March 24, 1978, students and soldiers burst into <PERSON> Tran </PERSON> <PERSON> Tuan </PERSON> <PERSON> Thi </PERSON>'s factories, ordered them closed and confiscated all the goods in the name of the socialist transformation of south <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>. Now, more than 10 years after he was left a pauper, <PERSON> Tran </PERSON> heads a private savings and loan association and runs a chicken farm, a food processing plant and six foodstores. <PERSON> Tran </PERSON> is an ethnic Chinese. His own resurgence parallels the change in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s policies toward its Chinese minority, the most dynamic ethnic group in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>. Eleven years ago, uniformed men broke down doors and dragged away shopkeepers throughout the Chinese quarter, arresting thousands as the Communist government of the north sought to bring revolution to the recently conquered south. The brutal policy left the Chinese community in ruins and proved a major factor in the deterioration of relations between <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>. It also led to an exodus of tens of thousands of Chinese. Vietnamese government officials got rich on the deal, demanding bribes for safe passage to port towns in the south. To this day, many of the escapees still languish in refugee camps around <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>. Now the government, faced with growing poverty and falling production, has turned to the <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> community for help in building <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>. Chinese have been coming to <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> since the 3rd century B.C. In the two milleniums since then, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> ruled <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> for 900 years. In other times, defeated Chinese armies, criminals, starving peasants and persecuted monks all made their way to <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>. About 400,000 ethnic Chinese live in <LOCATION> Ho </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Chi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Minh </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, mostly in the <LOCATION> Cholon </LOCATION> suburb. Estimates of Chinese nationwide vary from 600,000 to 1 million. `` Our recent treatment of the Chinese has not always been completely perfect,'' acknowledges <PERSON> Nghi </PERSON> <PERSON> Doan </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ho </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Minh </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION>'s 5th District, which includes <LOCATION> Cholon </LOCATION>. `` But now we are even accepting that their businesses will undertake a certain level of exploitation, as long as it benefits production.'' These are radical words for a dedicated Communist. <PERSON> Nghi </PERSON>, himself an ethnic Chinese, has been a party member for 43 of his 61 years. During the Vietnam War he did underground work against the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and South Vietnamese governments. In some cases, property confiscated from <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> has been returned. Starting early this year, businessmen were allowed to open private banks. An ad hoc stock market has formed among Chinese traders. Government officials turn a blind eye to the black market, and privately owned factories have been encouraged. Even big businessmen like <PERSON> Ly </PERSON> <PERSON> Sen </PERSON>, an ethnic Chinese who was named one of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s three `` super-capitalists'' in a show trial in 1975, have been released from jail and encouraged to add their expertise to <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s development. `` The Commies are our slaves now,'' said one <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> merchant who learned his colloquial English from American GI customers during the war. `` They need us more than we need them.'' But the change has not completely satisfied the Chinese. Chairman <PERSON> Nghi </PERSON> estimates that production for District 5 has yet to reach half of what is was during the Vietnam War years, when little factories, bars and restaurants served an international clientele of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> soldiers and Southeast Asian businessmen. Chinese community leaders estimate that tens of thousands still want to leave <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>. And many Chinese businessmen say they are worried the government's policies might turn radical again. `` I'm not doing anything big right now,'' said the <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> merchant. `` I do n't know when Big Boss is going to crack down. Most of us are just watching.'' But others, like <PERSON> Tran </PERSON> <PERSON> Tuan </PERSON> <PERSON> Thi </PERSON>, are going full steam ahead. Several years ago as reform policies began, <PERSON> Tran </PERSON> scraped together some capital from friends and started a food processing factory. Then he rented out storefronts to sell his goods. Impressed with his success, the government contacted <PERSON> Tran </PERSON> and offered him land to start a chicken farm. Tran jumped at the chance for a joint venture with the state,. `` I've got a lot of guts,'' he said. `` But I also figured the more I work with the government, the less chance there is of them taking things away from me.'' Six months ago, <PERSON> Tran </PERSON> started a private bank, the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. Together with <PERSON> Ly </PERSON>, who was a top banker during the war, he amassed hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of investments. Loans are made at 8 percent to 10 percent a month. And deposits pay 7 percent a month, compounded quarterly, or 125 percent a year, <PERSON> Ly </PERSON> says. The rates, which battle <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s annual inflation of at least 30 percent, are higher than the government's monthly rate of 5 percent for deposits and 8 percent for loans. `` They trust us, they trust me,'' <PERSON> Ly </PERSON> said, explaining his success. `` I've been a banker all my life so they have confidence.'' Another reason is that customers can withdraw their money freely. State banks still demand a list of reasons, and often substantial bribes, to approve withdrawals. <PERSON> Ly </PERSON>'s son and daughter both escaped to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> as boat people. His wife also left several months before he was let out of jail in 1987 after 12 years. Despite the changes in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, he said he still hopes to leave. `` I'm an old man and miss my family,'' says the 64-year-old. `` I was once part of this country's future but now I'm part of its past.''

 <PERSON> Denis </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldberg </PERSON> no longer feels uneasy in a crowd. But whenever he sits down to write his memoirs, the recollections of 21 years in a South African prison still overwhelm him. He served the longest prison term imposed on a white militant, and now is in his fifth year in British exile. But he says the ideals that got him, <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> and six other black nationalists locked up for plotting to overthrow the white-led minority government made his life sentence bearable. `` I did n't count every day I was in prison, but I calculated it,'' <PERSON> Goldberg </PERSON>, now 56, says in an interview. `` I was there 7,904 days. I do n't regret one day, it was worth it. `` I certainly do not repudiate my past actions. I do not repudiate the armed struggle _ I think it's essential.'' At 29, <PERSON> Goldberg </PERSON> was an engineer turned bomb-maker for the <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, the banned black nationalist movement. He was arrested at an <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> hideout in <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION> and given three life sentences in June 1964 for `` campaigning to overthrow the government by violent revolution.'' Deported in 1985 after undertaking not to participate in political violence, he now runs the <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION>'s mail order business in north <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> selling mostly T-shirts and posters. He lectures occasionally in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and abroad. On Tuesday, President F.W. <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON> said he will free five of <PERSON> Goldberg </PERSON>'s co-defendants, including <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> political strategist <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Sisulu </PERSON>, but not <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>. The other co-defendant, <PERSON> Govan </PERSON> <PERSON> Mbeki </PERSON>, was freed in 1987. <PERSON> Goldberg </PERSON> calls their release `` a public relations exercise to show <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON> is amenable to change.'' It took <PERSON> Goldberg </PERSON> two years to adjust to freedom in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. Finally, one morning, `` suddenly I felt at ease; The crowds did n't bother me. `` There's a lot of softness and gentleness outside that is enriching,'' he says. `` It sounds corny but it's very, very true. I find life incredibly exciting, fulfilling and worthwhile.'' His wife <PERSON> Esme </PERSON>, 60, says: `` Prison made him tender.'' But the memories of prison run deep. `` I find that when I do sit down to write about it, I simply do n't sleep,'' he said. `` A recollection of one incident brings back a whole chain of incidents and events, and I find that this just overwhelms me.'' The former engineer said he gradually was driven to violence by revulsion for apartheid, the race-separation system under which 5 million whites disenfranchise 28 million blacks. He's chubbier now and losing his hair, and his quirky humor masks a deep hurt at having missed seeing his two children grow up. His son, <PERSON> David </PERSON>, was 8 and his daughter, <PERSON> Hilary </PERSON>, 5 when he left <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION> in May 1963, intent on fleeing abroad. A bomb had exploded in his garden, obscenities were painted on his car and police were clamping down on dissidents. He stayed on briefly to organize arms production for the <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION>. `` Had I not been arrested, I would have gone on to start production of land mines and grenades and timing devices and so on,'' he says. `` Bomb-maker is a pejorative term. My people said that what I was doing was just and justified.'' <PERSON> Goldberg </PERSON> served most of his sentence in the whites-only <LOCATION> Pretoria </LOCATION> Prison. `` In a country where prison is the norm in the lives of most black South Africans, it was perhaps a way of identifying,'' he said. `` That we could survive and come out relatively whole people is really a victory over people who try to smash us.'' After a reunion with his family, who had moved to <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> during his trial, he said his son, then 29 and married with children, `` needed me to tell him I had n't left him.'' `` I told him I did n't see how I could ever make my family above all other families,'' he says. `` Kids suffer and starve not because their parents are politically active, but that's the nature of apartheid, and I felt I had to do something.'' His eyes reddened with emotion behind horn-rimmed glasses. `` I've had some suffering. So! Lots of people have died. People are getting hanged, people are getting shot. I'm alive. Life's great.

<HEAD>Mudslide in Amazon Gold Pit Kills Eight</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Eight miners were killed and five injured when a hill of loose earth gave way at a gold mining pit in the northeastern <LOCATION> Amazon </LOCATION> state of <LOCATION> Para </LOCATION>, officials said. The disaster occurred around Wednesday morning in the remote mountain range of <LOCATION> Serra </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pelada </LOCATION>, some 1,900 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION>, when a 50-foot wall of loose earth collapsed and swallowed the men alive, said <PERSON> Manoel </PERSON> <PERSON> Candido </PERSON>, leader of the <ORGANIZATION> Serra </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peleda </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mining </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cooperative </ORGANIZATION>. `` A wall of earth completely smothered them,'' <PERSON> Candido </PERSON> said by telephone. <PERSON> Candido </PERSON> said the victims were among a group of some 40 men working at the time of the mudslide in the mine, known as the `` Deep Hole.'' Some 25,000 miners work in the region, he said. `` The earth is very loose in the region. Those miners were warned not to mine in the area but there are not enough police to keep them away,'' <PERSON> Candido </PERSON> said. He said a similar accident occurred near the mine site two weeks ago, killing three miners. Rescue teams of civil and state police arrived at the site hours after the disaster and pulled a number of men from the earth, he said. `` We've saved some but there could be others still buried,'' <PERSON> Candido </PERSON> said. He said the rescue workers would search for more victims through the night. Such accidents have grown more common since an estimated 1 million prospectors invaded <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>'s vast <LOCATION> Amazon </LOCATION> jungle after rich deposits of alluvial gold were discovered there in 1979. Since then, thousands of people, mostly unskilled peasants, have been lured to mine sites where they dig with their hands and carry bags of mud on their backs and up precarious rope ladders.

 <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s first public auction of llamas did little for the long-eyelashed beast of burden's new status as a fashionable pet.

The highest price paid was $ 8,000 for a 4-year-old female llama, but a final bid of $ 11,200 for two alpacas came in below the reserve price.

 The pilot zoomed low between the pink, craggy peaks of the <LOCATION> Sheep </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountains </LOCATION>, suddenly twisting his F-16 Falcon vertically into the desert sky before diving on the target, a railroad bridge. Capt. <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> `` Omar'' <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON>'s plane plunged toward the bridge as he pushed his `` pickle'' button, simulating bombs away. <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> pointed the Falcon's nose up, climbed radically and turned, eliciting groans from his reporter passenger as the `` Gs'' increased to seven times the force of gravity. The lean, 30-year-old pilot from <LOCATION> Binghamton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, did n't seem bothered. `` We have to do a lot of things to keep in condition,'' he said. <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> pushed the fighter past <ORGANIZATION> Mach </ORGANIZATION> 1, through the sound barrier, and with a sonic boom for salute, headed back toward the <ORGANIZATION> Tactical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fighter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weapons </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> at <ORGANIZATION> Nellis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION>, known in the <ORGANIZATION> Tactical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION> as `` The Home of the Fighter Pilot.'' Despite improved superpower relations, with hopes high for general world peace, professional warriors are still working to keep a combat edge. `` Gunsmoke'' a biennial competition, decides the `` best of the best'' in <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> precision gunnery and bombing. `` Peace is breaking out all over, so why maintain the edge?'' asked Maj. Gen. <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> <PERSON> McCoy </PERSON>, a 6-foot-4 Texan who flew 223 missions in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> and commands the fighter training center at <LOCATION> Nellis </LOCATION>. `` Every kid -LRB- competing in Gunsmoke -RRB- will tell you today that we have always dickered best from a position of strength. ... We ought to have a pair of Russian generals out here. I'd host'em for the whole two weeks,'' said <PERSON> McCoy </PERSON>. As <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> soared away from the target area in his fighter, a formation of A-10 Thunderbolt pilots from the <ORGANIZATION> Connecticut </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> swept by, completing bombing and strafing runs that were part of the two-week shooting competition, which ends Saturday.

Maj. <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoy </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Falls </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Neb. </LOCATION>, who was `` Top Gun'' in his A-10 Thunderbolt two years ago, said, `` I do n't think any rational individual would wish to be at war, but it can be difficult being a warrior when peace is breaking out. `` The biggest problem the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> has to deal with when we are not in conflict is complacency. ...

The flier, nicknamed `` Omar'' for the World War II general, faces the possibility he will never fire a shot in anger. `` The slogan for tactical aviation is ` Readiness is our profession,''' he said. `` The military needs to detach itself from the emotions'' about hopes for relaxed tension between the superpowers. Without the ordeal of combat to provide the ultimate warrior's test, the fliers use competitions such as `` Gunsmoke,'' the biggest of its kind, to maintain their adrenaline levels `` Next to my marriage and the birth of my children, it was the most exciting moment of my life to be able to sit back in a moment of quiet reflection and realize that on that day, I was the best,'' <PERSON> Hoy </PERSON> said.

 It is not only the tens of thousands of ordinary workers, students, housewives and shopkeepers who are complaining about conditions in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and berating its leaders. Even privileged <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> members, some of them world renowned figures in the sports, musical and theater worlds, have joined the chorus. Many of them risk jeopardizing the special status they enjoy if their criticisms get too loud. Still, authors, entertainers, artists and sports personalities have urged the hard-line leadership to re-examine its policies and open a dialogue with opposition groups. The calls have ranged from a joint appeal by as many as 300 <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> artists to individual statements by such prominent authors as <PERSON> Christa </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON>. <PERSON> Katarina </PERSON> <PERSON> Witt </PERSON>, the two-time Olympic figure skating gold medalist and possibly the best-known East German abroad, said the Communist government must think about the causes for the exodus of its people to the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION>. About 50,000 East Germans have fled West in recent months, either crossing <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s recently opened border to <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION> or after seeking refuge in <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION>'s embassies in <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. The exodus deeply embarrassed the government last weekend during 40th anniversary festivities that were overshadowed by nationwide demonstrations unseen since Soviet tanks crushed a workers' uprising in 1953 `` It makes me sad, it hurts me that so many people have left the country,'' Ms. <PERSON> Witt </PERSON> told reporters in <LOCATION> Munich </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, where she was touring this week with a show. `` Something will change -LRB- in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> -RRB-,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Witt </PERSON>, herself a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and a beneficiary of the perks bestowed on major athletic stars. Ms. <PERSON> Witt </PERSON> has been a glamorous ambassador of goodwill and previously limited her political statments to praise for the benefits of a socialist system. The brutal force used by security police against demonstrators over the weekend caused some public figures to call for restraint. <PERSON> Christa </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON>, a well-known author who is widely read in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, urged both sides to show `` prudence, calm and patience.'' In a statement broadcast by West German radio stations, she criticized Communist authorities for outlawing the New Forum opposition group, calling the move a `` fatal'' mistake. The author, whose daughter and son-in-law were arrested during weekend demonstrations in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>, called for a broad dialogue over the future of the country. <PERSON> Kurt </PERSON> <PERSON> Masur </PERSON>, chief director of the famed <LOCATION> Leipzig </LOCATION> Gewandhause orchestra, and cabaret star <PERSON> Berndt </PERSON> <PERSON> Lutz </PERSON> <PERSON> Lange </PERSON> joined three local <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> officials in calling for a dialogue between the opposition and authorities. After their statement was read on <LOCATION> Leipzig </LOCATION> radio about 70,000 people demonstrated in the city Monday evening. Unlike the weekend clashes, the biggest demonstration in the current wave of protests ended peacefully with no intervention from massive security forces. Actors in two <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> theaters have posted statements calling for dialogue between the state and the opposition. A similar statement was read by the cast in the <LOCATION> Dresden </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Theater </LOCATION> after a recent performance. After authorities warned the actors not to read the statement again, they stood silently on the stage after the next performance and distributed it to the public. A group of 300 <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> painters, sculptors and other artists have passed a resolution calling for a broad public discussion of the country's problems. They also urged the state-controlled media to open up to all forces seeking democratic reforms. A statement by 44 entertainers, including well-known East German rock bands such as <PERSON> Pankow </PERSON> and City, criticized the `` unbearable ignorance'' of the Communist leadership. The statement, published in a <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> newspaper, called for reforms `` that will not remove socialism but continue to make it possible'' in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Hermann </PERSON> <PERSON> Kant </PERSON>, president of the official <ORGANIZATION> Writers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> and a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, wrote an open letter to the <ORGANIZATION> Junge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Welt </ORGANIZATION> newspaper criticizing censorship in the media. The letter, published on Monday by the official youth newspaper, said it would be wrong to abscribe `` our current defeat'' to the `` evil class enemy.'' <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s state-run newspapers have bitterly denounced Western, particularly West German media, blaming them for triggering the exodus and instigating the protests.

 Gunmen on motorcycles Tuesday killed two employees of the newspaper <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Espectador </ORGANIZATION> in an attempt by cocaine traffickers to force the <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION> daily to end its anti-drug crusade. Later Tuesday, the spasm of violence in <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> worsened as assailants shot to death a journalist on a downtown street and killed four people in a working-class neighborhood bar. Police said the unidentified assassins killed <PERSON> Roberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Sarasty </PERSON>, the 55-year-old director of <ORGANIZATION> Cronista </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratica </ORGANIZATION> magazine, while he was walking with another journalist. His companion was slightly wounded. At about the same time, another group fired at a crowd at a bar in Manrique, a northern <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> barrio, killing four in a spray of bullets before fleeing. <PERSON> Manrique </PERSON> is a known recruiting ground for `` sicarios,'' or hitmen used by drug traffickers. The shootings in <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION>, where only 11 <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Espectador </ORGANIZATION> employees remain, followed 13 bombings in three other Colombian cities overnight. It was the largest outbreak of bomb attacks since drug lords, blamed for slaying a presidential candidate, went to war with the government nearly two months ago. Tuesday's violence came during a visit to <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> by <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> Gen. <PERSON> Maxwell </PERSON> <PERSON> Thurman </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION> based in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. Killed within an hour of each other Tuesday afternoon were <PERSON> Marta </PERSON> <PERSON> Luz </PERSON> <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON> and <PERSON> Miguel </PERSON> <PERSON> Soler </PERSON>, a spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Espectador </ORGANIZATION> in this capital told The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. Miss <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON> was administrator of the paper's <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> office, and <PERSON> Soler </PERSON> was the daily's circulation manager in the city of 2 million people. In a telephone call to the paper's <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> office, a man who did not identify himself said a group known as the Extraditables had killed the two and he said they would kill other <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Espectador </ORGANIZATION> workers who did not leave <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> within three days, an editor at the newspaper said on condition of anonymity. The Extraditables are suspected drug traffickers sought for extradition to stand trial in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. A senior <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Espectador </ORGANIZATION> reporter, who also spoke on condition of anonymity, told <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> in a telephone interview that none of the paper's 1,200 employees had quit, though many have received death threats in the past. However, one of the paper's owners, speaking in <LOCATION> Monterrey </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, at the annual conference of the <ORGANIZATION> Inter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, said <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Espectador </ORGANIZATION> may close its <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> office. `` I do n't know if we'll be able to continue operating in the city of <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> under the circumstances,'' said <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Gabriel </PERSON> <PERSON> Cano </PERSON>, president of the paper's editorial board. He also said the 102-year-old newspaper may have to close eventually because of financial problems caused by the bombing of the main offices last month. The car bomb at its <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION> building caused heavy damage and forced the newspaper to cut operations. About 50 soldiers now guard that building 24 hours a day. <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Espectador </ORGANIZATION> publisher <PERSON> Guillermo </PERSON> <PERSON> Cano </PERSON> was assassinated by drug traffickers in a spray of submachine gun fire Dec. 17, 1986, as he was leaving the newspaper in his car. <PERSON> Soler </PERSON> was killed in front of his house Tuesday by a man who rode by on a motorcycle, <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Espectador </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Alfonso </PERSON> <PERSON> Bernal </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. Miss <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON> was killed by a shot in the neck, and her mother was wounded in a leg while the two women sat in their white sedan at a traffic light, the paper's spokesman in <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION> said. Nineteen people were injured by explosions in <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Barranquilla </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Pereira </PERSON>, the police said. No one claimed responsibility, but authorities assume the scores of bombs set off since August were planted by the drug gangs, who supply 80 percent of the cocaine sold in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. There were no indications whether the overnight bombings were connected with <PERSON> Thurman </PERSON>'s visit. No <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops are stationed in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>, but the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has delivered $ 65 million worth of military aid to help in the fight against drug traffickers. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> technicians arrived last month to help train Colombians to operate or repair some of the equipment, but were here only a few days and none remained behind. President <PERSON> Virgilio </PERSON> <PERSON> Barco </PERSON> has said he does not want <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> soldiers in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> even as advisers. <PERSON> Thurman </PERSON>'s 24-hour visit included a meeting Monday with <PERSON> Barco </PERSON> and Gen. <PERSON> Miguel </PERSON> <PERSON> Maza </PERSON>, commander of the <ORGANIZATION> Administrative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, the government investigative police, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> said. The embassy described the meeting as routine. <PERSON> Thurman </PERSON> left <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION> on Tuesday. <PERSON> El </PERSON> <PERSON> Tiempo </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION> daily usually well-informed about the government, said <PERSON> Thurman </PERSON> also met with Gen. <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> <PERSON> Botero </PERSON>, the defense minister. The bombings Monday night and early Tuesday included nine in <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION> that injured eight people, and three in <LOCATION> Pereira </LOCATION>, wounding 11, the national police said. Police said a man who planted one of the bombs was killed in a shootout with officers. Authorities have reported 161 explosions since Aug. 19 and give the casualties as 11 dead and 183 wounded.

 The career diplomats' union is using newly released <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> documents in a bid to bolster its claim that some political nominees for ambassadorships are unqualified for their jobs. Less than a month after the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> filed suit to obtain the documents, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> last week handed over to the union 51 `` certificates of competence'' of ambassadorial nominees. In filing the suit, <ORGANIZATION> AFSA </ORGANIZATION> had said the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> was abusing the `` confidential'' classification to avoid embarrassment because the certificates could not conceal the lack of qualifications of some nominees. The career diplomats have complained for years about what they regard as presidents' tendency to nominate as ambassadors diplomatic novices at the expense of foreign service professionals. The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> had repeatedly refused to comment on the substance of the association's complaint, although department spokeswoman <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON> noted last month that President <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> went outside the diplomatic service when he chose <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> as <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> ambassador in 1970. A 1980 law says ambassadorial nominees should be knowledgeable about all aspects of the country of their assignment and that political campaign contributions `` should not be a factor'' in the selection process. One example cited by <ORGANIZATION> AFSA </ORGANIZATION> was <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Zappala </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> developer who was nominated to be ambassador to <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> after reportedly donating $ 126,000 to the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> last year. <ORGANIZATION> AFSA </ORGANIZATION> maintained that <PERSON> Zappala </PERSON>'s qualifications, as shown in the certificate, were not consistent with requirements for background knowledge of the host country. The certificate states that <PERSON> Zappala </PERSON>'s `` impressive business background in real estate combined with his civic activities qualify him as an excellent candidate for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassador to <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Zappala </PERSON> won <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> confirmation by a 79-20 vote. While some political appointees, including the former ambassador to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Mansfield </PERSON>, have excelled, others have been an embarrassment, career diplomats say. One frequently cited example is a former ambassador to a <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> country who often spent evening hours on his luxury boat, using the sail as a screen for showing his collection of pornographic movies. A <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> nominee who drew criticism from <ORGANIZATION> AFSA </ORGANIZATION> is <PERSON> Sally </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Novetske </PERSON>, legislative representative of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Vocational </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION>, selected to be ambassador to <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION>. Her certificate called her an `` excellent candidate'' but <ORGANIZATION> AFSA </ORGANIZATION> Vice President <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Schmitz </PERSON> described her resume as `` unusually thin.'' Last Saturday, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> confirmed by voice vote two other politically well-connected nominees whose appointments had drawn criticism from Sen. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Sarbanes </PERSON>, D-Md. They are <PERSON> Della </PERSON> <PERSON> Newman </PERSON>, a real estate broker headed for <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION> who managed President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state campaign last year; and <PERSON> Melvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Sembler </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> real estate tycoon who is bound for <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> after contributing $ 127,000 to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s 1988 campaign. Their respective certificates, released by the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, described them both as `` excellent candidates'' but made little further effort to back up the recommendations. <PERSON> Schmitz </PERSON> said the certificates are not prepared by the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> but by two <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> political appointees who work out of an office that deals with personnel matters.

 More than 100 <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> air traffic controllers fired during the 1981 strike are seeking reinstatement after a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> panel said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aviation officials altered time sheets and lied to an employee appeals board. Citing the new evidence, attorneys for the controllers asked the <ORGANIZATION> Merit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> to reopen the cases. `` Right or wrong they -LRB- the controllers -RRB- were entitled to their day in court,'' attorney <PERSON> Phillip </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wood </PERSON> said Tuesday. `` If it turns out the entire evidentiary product was phony and they destroyed the original evidence, what else is there?'' <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Farrar </PERSON> said he had no comment on the petition filed by <PERSON> Wood </PERSON> and attorney <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Klein </PERSON>. The board upheld the firings in 1985 based on <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> attendance records, which showed that the <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> controllers failed to report to work during the strike. But a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> panel last month said <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> officials doctored evidence and lied to the board when they said the time sheets used to defend the firings were the same ones kept during the strike. Instead, the subcommittee's report said, <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> officials set up a `` war room'' at the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Route </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Traffic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Aurora </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, and for three months created records to replace original, shoddy documents. <PERSON> Wood </PERSON> said the controllers want their jobs back. He said he was not disputing whether the controllers failed to report to work during the strike by the <ORGANIZATION> Professional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Traffic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Controllers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>. Rather, like the subcommittee, <PERSON> Wood </PERSON> said he was concerned about the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> records placed before the appeals board. `` The board has to look beyond the litigants here,'' he said. `` It has to look at the integrity of the system. How can anyone win when the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> pulled what it pulled here?'' The petition to reopen the cases was filed last week. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Works </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee has asked the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> to investigate current and former <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> officials for possible criminal misconduct. During the strike, President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> fired 11,500 controllers, including about 450 in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>.

 Private researchers charge the White House with wholesale violations of federal record-keeping laws and say their suit to block destruction of <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration computer tapes would not hamstring President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in performing his duties. Lawyers for several research groups filed their response Tuesday to a <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> move in a case that could decide whether the White House can routinely destroy the kind of computer messages that were discovered in the Iran-Contra affair. After a chance for government lawyers to answer the new arguments, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Richey </PERSON> will decide whether to proceed with the case or allow it to go directly to the <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> as the government wants. <PERSON> Richey </PERSON> ruled on Sept. 15 that the private organizations may sue the president to block erasure of the tapes. Lawyers for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Archive </ORGANIZATION> and other organizations claim the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration is trying to avoid responding to inquiries that will reveal `` wholesale violations of the Presidential Records Act and the other federal records laws through the routine destruction of information.'' The case involves 12 days of tapes generated on the Professional Office System, known as PROFS, used in the Executive Office of the President. On Jan. 18, two days before he left office, President <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> instructed staff members to erase their computer message systems. The next day, the organizations filed suit to require the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> to preserve backup tapes that stored these messages in a computer bank. The tapes have since been preserved under a temporary restraining order issued in January by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Barrington </PERSON> <PERSON> Parker </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> asked on Sept. 27 that the case be shunted directly to the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION>, partly because it involved `` a threat to the president's authority.'' The organizations that filed suit denied `` such dire consequences'' are involved. They argued that <PERSON> Richey </PERSON>'s Sept. 15 order does not interfere with the president's ability to do his duties. Instead, they said, the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> is apparently trying to assure the president of `` authority to make unilateral -LRB- and unreviewable -RRB- decisions to destroy the PROFS information, regardless of whether it falls within the definition of ` presidential records' that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has mandated must be preserved for the benefit of future generations.'' The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Archive </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> nonprofit group that researches national security issues, filed the suit along with the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Library </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Historical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studies </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>. The PROFS messages played an important role in the congressional investigation of the Iran-Contra affair during <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s admninistration <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> aide at the center of the affair, frequently sent PROFS messages to his superiors. In November 1986, he tried to erase them, but he did not know they were automatically being stored on magnetic tape in the central computer bank. By using these tapes, the congressional committees investigating the affair were able to reconstruct much of the information.

<HEAD>Battle of Words: Where Did the Revolution Begin?</HEAD>

<DATELINE>POINT PLEASANT, W.Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Guns, knives and tomahawks were the tools of war 215 years ago when the Battle of Point Pleasant raged on a narrow strip of land where the <LOCATION> Kanawha </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> rivers meet. Now, words and history books serve as the weapons. Point Pleasant claims that it, not <LOCATION> Lexington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, was the site of the first battle of the American Revolution. Historians and geographers acknowledge that the battle _ known as <ORGANIZATION> Lord </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dunmore </ORGANIZATION>'s War _ is important, but for other reasons. `` They came out this way to solve an Indian problem _ the uprising of the <LOCATION> Shawnee </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Gould </PERSON>, a former history professor and now <ORGANIZATION> Marshall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>'s provost. `` It can be extremely difficult to say it's the first battle of the Revolution.'' But that's what Point Pleasant residents celebrated Tuesday, the anniversary of the battle. Before the battle, the <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> armies marched to invade the Indian country. Four days later a 1,000-man division under Gen. <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> was attacked by about 1,000 Indians led by Chief Cornstalk. Finally, after a nearly daylong battle, the Indians retreated, leaving 33 dead. The Virginians had 60 killed and 96 wounded. The victory resulted in a treaty on terms dictated by <PERSON> Dunmore </PERSON>, the Colonial governor. `` <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has declared this a battle of the Revolution and in a chronological list of the battles, this is the first,'' said <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> <PERSON> Reed </PERSON>, superintendent of the Point Pleasant Battle Monument State Park. According to records at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sons </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revolution </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Louisville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on Feb. 17, 1908, passed a resolution recognizing the Battle of Point Pleasant as a fight in the American Revolution and appropriated money for a monument dedicated Oct. 10, 1909 _ the battle's 135th anniversary. Consequently, both the Sons and Daughters of the American Revolution accept descendants from the battle as members. `` It's annoying that this should have to be covered up,'' said <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pennell </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Birmingham </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>, a past historian general for the <ORGANIZATION> SAR </ORGANIZATION>. `` We're fighting <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>'s hold on history. That group has been mighty tight with history.'' <PERSON> Pennell </PERSON> said he grew up believing that the Revolution began in <LOCATION> Lexington </LOCATION> on April 19, 1775 _ six months after Point Pleasant. He changed his mind after meeting a West Virginian who mentioned the battle, its significance and the congressional resolution. `` We need a nationally recognized historian to look at this and say, ` Yea' or ` Nay.' And you have to get someone away from the <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> area,'' <PERSON> Pennell </PERSON> said. `` Nobody has ever refuted publicly the statement in this congressional record that this is the first battle of the Revolution.'' <PERSON> Gould </PERSON> agrees the battle should be recognized by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, but not as a Revolutionary fight. `` We can say that the events that precipitated the Battle of Point Pleasant had little to do with colonial grievances against the crown,'' <PERSON> Gould </PERSON> said. `` The impact was that it kept the <ORGANIZATION> Shawnees </ORGANIZATION> quiet for a while when the first shots were fired in <LOCATION> Lexington </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Concord </LOCATION>. `` I do n't think anyone fighting in the battle saw it as a rebellion against the crown.'' In 1903, the <ORGANIZATION> Ohio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Archaeological </ORGANIZATION> and Historical Quarterly called Point Pleasant the first Revolutionary fight because <PERSON> Dunmore </PERSON> put the <ORGANIZATION> Indians </ORGANIZATION> up to it to create two battlefronts for the colonists. <PERSON> Gould </PERSON> said <PERSON> Dunmore </PERSON> was a loyalist but doubted whether he staged the fight. Although Point Pleasant claims the first battle of the Revolution, the historian at the Minute Men National Historical Park in <LOCATION> Concord </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, says he never heard of the conflict. `` I think they're reaching,'' historian <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> <PERSON> Sabin </PERSON> said. `` People often do that with historical firsts. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>' resolution 81 years ago should have recognized Point Pleasant's significance in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>' western expansion, said <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Clagg </PERSON>, <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON>'s professor emeritus in geography and the author of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>'s section in the Encyclopaedia Britannica. `` It was significant in breaking the Indian stronghold in the West,'' <PERSON> Clagg </PERSON> said. `` It established that we were willing to make a stand on this side of the mountains.'' Treaties that ended hostilities in the late 1700s gave the new country rights to lands as far west as the <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> largely because of the victory at Point Pleasant, <PERSON> Gould </PERSON> said. Without the victory, he said, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would have been granted lands only as west as the <ORGANIZATION> Alleghenies </ORGANIZATION>, leaving everything beyond to <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>. `` I think they might be celebrating the wrong thing,'' <PERSON> Gould </PERSON> said. `` They ought to be celebrating the significance of that victory in American history, and that's that it secured the frontier.''

 <ORGANIZATION> MCI </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> is asking a federal court to force <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Telegraph </ORGANIZATION>'s `` deceptive'' ads off the air, even though <ORGANIZATION> MCI </ORGANIZATION> claims it is taking 100,000 customers a week away from its rival. <ORGANIZATION> MCI </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> McGowan </PERSON> said Tuesday that <ORGANIZATION> MCI </ORGANIZATION> filed suit because <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T is using false and deceptive ads comparing the two long-distance phone services in a `` desperate'' attempt to stem the loss of customers. `` They are panicking about it,'' <PERSON> McGowan </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T's market share has fallen to 75 percent since <ORGANIZATION> MCI </ORGANIZATION> broke the old <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> System </ORGANIZATION>'s monopoly on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> phone service in the 1970s. <ORGANIZATION> MCI </ORGANIZATION>'s share now is more than 10 percent. <PERSON> McGowan </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> MCI </ORGANIZATION> research showed <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> T </ORGANIZATION> is losing even more than 100,000 customers a week, but <ORGANIZATION> MCI </ORGANIZATION>'s marketing department, which has been trumpeting that number in its own ads, `` likes round numbers.'' But, he said, <ORGANIZATION> MCI </ORGANIZATION> is suffering substantial financial losses even as it takes away <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T customers. The <ORGANIZATION> MCI </ORGANIZATION> lawsuit in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, the latest in a long string of dustups between the nation's two leading long-distance companies, charges <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T made false comparisons between its service and <ORGANIZATION> MCI </ORGANIZATION>'s Primetime, cut-rate long-distance calling plan. <ORGANIZATION> MCI </ORGANIZATION> complains about <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> T </ORGANIZATION> ads that say <ORGANIZATION> MCI </ORGANIZATION>'s rates are cheaper only when brief calls are made over 900 miles away and after 7 p.m. and that <ORGANIZATION> MCI </ORGANIZATION> customers `` might have had better luck calling Mars'' than trying to reach <ORGANIZATION> MCI </ORGANIZATION> for an explanation of their bills. <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T `` maliciously attacked <ORGANIZATION> MCI </ORGANIZATION>'s honesty and the value of <ORGANIZATION> MCI </ORGANIZATION>'s competing services by falsely and deceptively representing that <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T was superior to its competitors in general, and <ORGANIZATION> MCI </ORGANIZATION> in particular, in terms of trustworthiness, quality and price,'' the suit said <ORGANIZATION> MCI </ORGANIZATION> itself is known for aggressive advertising, such as showing people fainting when they see their non-MCI long-distance phone bills. But <PERSON> McGowan </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> MCI </ORGANIZATION> now is being outspent 8-to-1 by <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T in advertising. He said he could not estimate the losses <ORGANIZATION> MCI </ORGANIZATION> had suffered as a result of <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T ads, but he said `` it's substantial.'' <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T spokesman <PERSON> Herb </PERSON> <PERSON> Linnen </PERSON> said, `` We welcome the opportunity to discuss who is misleading whom and will do so in a countersuit. ... We have been concerned about <ORGANIZATION> MCI </ORGANIZATION>'s sometimes misleading print and broadcast advertising and have complained about it directly to <ORGANIZATION> MCI </ORGANIZATION>.'' He said <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T attorneys sent a letter to <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> CNN </ORGANIZATION> this month complaining that <ORGANIZATION> MCI </ORGANIZATION> was stretching facts in ads that claim `` MCI always saves you money over <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> T </ORGANIZATION>, month after month'' and that every week 100,000 <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T customers switch to <ORGANIZATION> MCI </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T said the ads are false and asked the networks to stop running them. <PERSON> Linnen </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> had replied that they would look into the matter, but <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> CNN </ORGANIZATION> had not yet responded to the letter. `` AT & amp; T stands behind its advertising,'' <PERSON> Linnen </PERSON> added. <ORGANIZATION> MCI </ORGANIZATION> complains in its suit about <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T statements that <ORGANIZATION> non-AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T companies provide slow telephone connections, that other companies do n't operate worldwide like <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> T </ORGANIZATION> and that competing 800, facsimile and WATS services are inferior. The suit asks the court to stop <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T `` from making false or deceptive representations that any <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T service is materially superior to any competing <ORGANIZATION> MCI </ORGANIZATION> service in terms of quality or lower cost, or that <ORGANIZATION> MCI </ORGANIZATION> has misrepresented its services or rates to consumers.'' It also asks a judge to force <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T to stop advertising for 12 months unless `` such information clearly and conspicuously discloses a court-approved corrective notice that mitigates the lingering effects of the misrepresentations described therein.'' <ORGANIZATION> MCI </ORGANIZATION> also wants the profits `` wrongfully amassed by <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T on the sale of its products or services during the period in question,'' plus interest and legal fees. The suit does not put a price on those profits.

<HEAD>WASHINGTON TODAY: John Sununu, the White House Disciplinarian</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM RAUM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 White House Chief of Staff <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> is the chief disciplinarian of the <ORGANIZATION> Bush </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, the one to whom top officials get sent when they misbehave. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, with the image of being kinder and gentler by far than his staff chief, rarely chews out members of his team directly, according to White House insiders. Instead, that's the job of <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON>, the former three-term <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> governor with a reputation for managing with a firm hand. Sometimes, when more than just a mild chastising is needed, the punishment is doled out in two parts: <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> talks to the errant official privately and <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> lets the world know about it. The most recent official to be so admonished by <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> was former Education Secretary <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>, currently the national drug policy director, had suggested at last month's education summit in <LOCATION> Charlottesville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, that some sessions among governors had been full of `` pap and ... stuff that rhymes with pap.'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> duly relayed <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON>'s words of wisdom to the independent-minded <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>: `` Thanks for your comments; they were n't helpful.'' `` I think <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>'s probably gotten the message,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said, thereby making sure that <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> did get the message. It was the same as the one-two reprimand dished out in March to <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> counsel <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Boyden </PERSON> <PERSON> Gray </PERSON>. He had publicly raised questions about the wisdom of a <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> compromise reached with <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and negotiated by Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> had met with <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> and `` they had a polite discussion about how things work in the White House.'' White House sources, who insisted upon anonymity, said other top administration officials who have received similar courses in `` how things work'' in the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> include: _ Veterans Affairs Secretary <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Derwinski </PERSON>, for announcing the government would not appeal a federal judge's decision on Agent Orange without first clearing it with Budget Director <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Darman </PERSON> The ruling, striking down restrictions on benefits, likely will result in more <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> compensation for Vietnam-era veterans exposed to the defoliant. _ Transportation Secretary <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON>, who was admonished not to `` fly alone'' in making decisions on a Dutch airline's participation in the buyout of <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> _ Interior Secretary <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Lujan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> again, who were brought in and told to stop bickering over turf battles in <LOCATION> Alaskan </LOCATION> oil spill cleanup efforts And Defense Secretary <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON>, soon after he was sworn in, rapidly learned that freelancing was n't a trait that won points with <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON>. Although it's not known what <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> might have told <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> privately, the chief of staff was quick to publicly repudiate <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON>'s forecast of eventual failure for <ORGANIZATION> Kremlin </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. In becoming <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> disciplinarian, <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> `` is just assuming a role that has been one of the traditional functions of the chief of staff,'' said a senior White House official who works with <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> and did n't wish to be identified for that reason. `` He's the one to keep people in line, and he's very good at it. He's not one you'd want to cross,'' the official said. <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Card </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, a <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> deputy and loyalist, said, `` Most people outside <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> do n't understand that the White House takes on the personality of the chief of staff more than it takes on the personality of the president.'' <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON>'s management style became an issue during the post-mortem pronouncements on what went wrong during last week's failed coup attempt in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. Critics have claimed a lack of coordination between the White House and other national security agencies contributed to the chaos. Reports of a rift between <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Adviser </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Scowcroft </ORGANIZATION> resurfaced _ friction that <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> sources say intensifies whenever <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> wanders into Scowcroft's realm. Former President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, too, sometimes used his chiefs of staff to administer rebukes to top officials. For instance, it was <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, chief of staff in <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s first term, and not the president who actually took then-budget director <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Stockman </PERSON> to the `` woodshed,'' according to <PERSON> Stockman </PERSON>'s account in his 1986 book `` Triumph of Politics. <PERSON> Stockman </PERSON>, in trouble for telling a magazine interviewer he had grave misgivings about <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s economic policies, wrote that he was n't scolded by <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> in the Oval Office meeting _ but urged by a moist-eyed <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> to stay on.

 <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> news </ORGANIZATION> anchor <PERSON> Deborah </PERSON> <PERSON> Norville </PERSON> says her taping of non-broadcast `` interviews'' of business executives during a paid appearance in February did n't violate the network's news guidelines. `` My understanding was that I would be interviewing some marketing people, which I did do,'' <PERSON> Norville </PERSON> said Tuesday of the appearance at a <ORGANIZATION> Philip </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morris </ORGANIZATION> corporate sales presentation in <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Norville </PERSON>, whose moonlighting at the conference first was reported in this week's Newsweek magazine, said the interviews were n't done for <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> and simply were part of the conference. `` But the format was more involved than that, as I discovered when I got there,'' she said. She said she had n't expected the format prepared for her might put her in a position of seeming to endorse some products. When she realized there was a problem, she said in a phone interview, she tried to make the best of `` an awkward situation.'' `` I rewrote everything they had prepared for me to say,'' she said. `` I just said, ` Look, I ca n't say these things.' And I made a point of rewriting everything so that nothing I said could be construed as an endorsement.'' In retrospect, the network would not have let her appear at the sales conference, said <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> president <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Gartner </PERSON>. `` None of us understood the format -LRB- of her engagement -RRB- until it was too late,'' he said. `` Had we understood what was involved or expected of <PERSON> Deborah </PERSON>, we would not have done it. And clearly it's something we would n't do again,'' he said in a prepared response to a query about the paid appearance she cited. <PERSON> Norville </PERSON>, who since Sept. 5 has been news anchor of the `` Today'' show, was anchor of `` NBC News at Sunrise'' when she got the invitation to appear at the sales meeting. She was given permission to accept by <PERSON> Gerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Solomon </PERSON>, then executive producer of `` Sunrise.'' <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> guidelines say that staff members considering invitations to speak, lecture or make personal appearances `` should use their judgment to avoid being placed in a situation in which they may be used for any purpose.'' <PERSON> Norville </PERSON>, who declined to say how much she was paid, said she `` certainly did n't accept the engagement with any thought that I would be violating any guidelines, and I do n't believe that I did.'' However, she conceded, `` it was a difficult situation. And I was there, and I had to be as graceful about it as I could, yet try to be mindful of what my responsibility as a journalist is. It was a difficult rope to walk and I tried to walk it as best as I could.''

 Four men believed to be illegal aliens were found dead Tuesday in a railroad trailer marked with skulls and a danger warning, and authorities tried to determine if a pesticide used on the flour inside contributed to their deaths. The Border Patrol was investigating to determine if smugglers put the men in the trailer, said <ORGANIZATION> Border </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Patrol </ORGANIZATION> agent <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> French </PERSON>. The four apparently were asphyxiated, said <LOCATION> Victoria </LOCATION> police Lt. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>. Autopsies were to be performed by the <ORGANIZATION> Travis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Examiner </ORGANIZATION>'s office in <LOCATION> Austin </LOCATION>, police said. Authorities also were investigating the death of a fifth found alongside railroad tracks in <LOCATION> Sinton </LOCATION>, where the train stopped earlier en route to <LOCATION> Victoria </LOCATION>. Investigators believe the death is related to the other four. <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Patricio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Sheriff <PERSON> Leroy </PERSON> <PERSON> Moody </PERSON> said it's possible the man died in the same railroad car and fell out. `` They put a hole in the roof about the size of a half dollar. Apparently one of them had a buckle knife he used to poke the hole,'' <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said, adding the hole probably was made for ventilation. <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuddeback </PERSON>, an investigator with the <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION>'s hazard communication branch in <LOCATION> Austin </LOCATION>, said the fumigant used in the trailer, loaded with flour, could be fatal if inhaled or injested. The trailer was piggybacked on a railroad flatcar. A sticker on the trailer door showed skulls and said in English and Spanish: `` Danger. This trailer is being fumigated.'' `` It's quite possible there was enough of the fumigant around to kill the guys,'' Ms. <PERSON> Cuddeback </PERSON> said. The fumigant can cause nausea and vomiting, she said. Ms. <PERSON> Cuddeback </PERSON> said the fumigant is `` really very, very nasty. The effects to -LRB- men in the trailer -RRB- could be pretty awful'' if it was inhaled. Three emergency medical service workers and seven <LOCATION> Victoria </LOCATION> police officers later were taken from the scene to a <LOCATION> Victoria </LOCATION> hospital. Some of the officers complained of nausea and vomiting, but the others were just under observation, said police Lt. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>. The victims' bodies were found by a <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> car inspector after a railroad worker noticed the door was open on the 40-foot trailer, normally part of a tractor-trailer rig or 18-wheeler. The victims appeared to be in their 20s, said <LOCATION> Victoria </LOCATION> police Lt. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>. Three of the four had papers, although police had n't verified the documents Tuesday. One had a Mexican passport, one had documents from <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>, and a third had papers that had been stamped in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> but indicated he was from <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> said. He said the fourth man did not carry any identification. French said the <ORGANIZATION> Border </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Patrol </ORGANIZATION> is working through the Mexican consul to identify the men. Police said the train left <LOCATION> Harlingen </LOCATION> on Monday evening, overnighted in <LOCATION> Sinton </LOCATION>, and continued on early Tuesday to <LOCATION> Victoria </LOCATION>, a town of about 50,000 people 125 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> and 200 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Harlingen </LOCATION>. The morning was cool, with temperatures at <LOCATION> Victoria </LOCATION> in the mid-50s. The trailer was half filled with boxes of corn flour called masa, used for tortillas. The masa had been fumigated with `` Phostoxin,'' an aluminum phosphate pesticide used against rodents and insects, before the trailer was sealed and loaded on the train in <LOCATION> Harlingen </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Jorge </PERSON> <PERSON> Trevino </PERSON>, quality control manager for the flour producer, <ORGANIZATION> Azteca </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Milling </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Edinburg </LOCATION>. He did not know exactly when a contractor had treated and sealed the trailer, but <PERSON> Azteca </PERSON> traffic manager <PERSON> Gonzalo </PERSON> <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> said the men must have broken into the trailer after it was put on the train. <LOCATION> Victoria </LOCATION> police Sgt. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Burney </PERSON> said symptoms caused by the pesticide `` are diarrhea and vomiting, which they found inside the car.'' Tuesday's discovery was the latest in a series of incidents since 1980 in which illegal aliens died after crossing into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. On July 2, 1987, 18 Mexican men suffocated after a smuggler locked them inside a railroad boxcar that was later parked for hours in the desert sun east of <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paso </LOCATION>. The men had crossed the border and entered the <LOCATION> Missouri-Pacific </LOCATION> freight yard at <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paso </LOCATION>. One man survived by punching a breathing hole in the boxcar floor with a spike. Since then, border agents have saved dozens of illegal aliens trapped in similar situations.

<HEAD>Starting Monday, Shrimpers Not Using Turtle Devices Face Stiff Fines</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Gulf Coast shrimpers are looking to President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> for a last-minute reprieve from regulations they claim will cost them nearly a third of their income. Unless <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> intervenes, shrimp fishermen will face stiff fines next week if they are caught without devices in their nets that prevent the drowning of endangered sea turtles. The <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shrimp </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> predicts quiet compliance with the law, but executive director <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Rayburn </PERSON> also says shrimpers could lose up to 30 percent of their catch at a time when earnings are banked to get them through the non-productive winter months. Congressmen from the Gulf Coast say shrimping is an endangered industry that can not afford to use the turtle excluder devices, or TEDs. `` You're beginning to see less shrimpers than less turtles,'' says Rep. <PERSON> Solomon </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortiz </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, who has watched the number of shrimp-industry employees in <LOCATION> Port </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Isabel </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, fall from nearly 3,000 to fewer than 400 in six years. <PERSON> Ortiz </PERSON> and Rep. <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> <PERSON> Tauzin </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-La </LOCATION>., say fuel and insurance costs for the shrimpers have been mounting as prices have been driven down by shrimp imports, which now account for 75 percent of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> consumption Although shrimpers have been required to use TEDs since Sept. 8, the federal government has forgiven the penalties _ at first in whole and later in part _ if a shrimper bought and installed a TED. Sunday, however, is the last day for such reprieves. On Monday a shrimper found in violation of the law faces an $ 8,000 fine. A second offense could result in a $ 15,000 fine and a third offense could cost $ 15,000 and the confiscation of the shrimper's vessel, catch, or both. That's unless <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who agreed to review the matter, intervenes in the long-fought battle between environmentalists and shrimpers over the use of TEDs. The issue is now before <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON>, the White House chief of staff, said <PERSON> Tauzin </PERSON>. <PERSON> Tauzin </PERSON> says he's expecting penalties and angry shrimpers if the law is n't modified, but hopes there wo n't be a repeat of earlier blockades of <ORGANIZATION> Gulf </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> shipping channels by protesting shrimp fishermen. <PERSON> Tauzin </PERSON> believes shrimpers could lose up to 50 percent of their catch as crews inexperienced with the devices search for ever-scarcer shrimp. A 10 percent loss in catch is enough to put some shrimpers out of business, he said. Government scientists have found losses from TEDs can range from 5 percent to 10 percent, or even less, but those demonstrations were conducted with crews experienced in using TEDs, <PERSON> Rayburn </PERSON> says. Conservationists argue shrimping is the single greatest cause of turtle mortality and that TEDs are the best prevention.

<HEAD>Demonstration Turns Into Riot, Many Injured</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 About 2,000 riot police swinging batons and firing water cannon broke up a demonstration outside a jail early today, and at least 64 people were injured, protest leaders and police reported. Police said 15 people were arrested but provided no further details of what appeared to be one of the most violent incidents since demonstrations were made legal after martial law was lifted in 1987. `` Riot police launched water cannons at us first. They then wielded clubs at the unarmed crowd,'' said protest leader <PERSON> Yang </PERSON> <PERSON> Chu-chun </PERSON>. `` I saw at least 20 people with head injuries in a nearby hospital, and we estimated at least 50 people were wounded'' seriously. In a statement, <ORGANIZATION> Taipei </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> said 14 police were hurt in the melee. The demonstration began Tuesday, on <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>'s National Day, when 10,000 people rallied outside the Tucheng jail in a <LOCATION> Taipei </LOCATION> suburb to demand the immediate release of prominent dissident <PERSON> Hsu </PERSON> <PERSON> Hsin-liang </PERSON>. The protesters, wearing yellow headbands and carrying yellow flowers, shouted `` Release <PERSON> Hsu </PERSON> <PERSON> Hsin-liang </PERSON>,'' and vowed to sleep outside the jail because they were denied permission to meet with <PERSON> Hsu </PERSON>. About 3,000 protesters remained past midnight. The fighting began at 3 a.m. today when riot police moved to disperse the crowd, which broke up after a two-hour clash. Police claimed the demonstration was illegal because protest leaders did not apply for permission and said breaking up the sit-in was designed to avoid violence. The statement said <PERSON> Hsu </PERSON>'s wife was among the arrested <PERSON> Hsu </PERSON>, 48, was jailed after he returning from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> last month, making the final portion of his journey in a fishing boat from <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. The government accuses him of helping organize a 1979 anti-government demonstration in the southern port of <LOCATION> Kaohsiung </LOCATION>. Protest leaders said the 1979 protest was aimed only at demanding more political freedom and that a retrial was necessary.

 A combination of high-tech devices, armed patrols, alligators and rattlesnakes should keep anti-nuclear demonstrators from reaching the space shuttle Atlantis' launch pad, security officials say. `` I would n't want to get into the number of officers, but you can be assured ... that we feel we have adequate people to take care of any situation,'' said <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Wistrand </PERSON>, deputy director of <ORGANIZATION> Kennedy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>'s security office. <PERSON> Wistrand </PERSON>'s comments Tuesday came in response to statements by anti-nuclear activists that they would try to infiltrate the launch pad if a federal judge failed to block the liftoff. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> Tuesday evening, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> Gasch </PERSON> ruled that the launch could go ahead because the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> had complied with the requirements of the National Environmental Protection Act. Attorneys for the <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> tried to block the launch of the shuttle and the plutonium-laden <ORGANIZATION> Galileo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jupiter </ORGANIZATION> probe on safety grounds. `` We're sad because the court did n't rule in our favor. But on the other side, we feel like we've succeeded in bringing the issue to the public, that they are plannning to put nuclear power in space,'' <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Gagnon </PERSON>, the group's coordinator in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, said after the ruling. <PERSON> Gagnon </PERSON> said protesters plan to follow through with their intention to block the launch by putting people on the launch pad. <PERSON> Wistrand </PERSON> said his force, armed with M-16 assault rifles and 9mm semiautomatic pistols, is prepared to find and arrest anyone who attempts to get onto the 140,000-acre space center. `` We're concerned by all aspects whether it's by land, by plane or by boat, but I think the most likely way is by foot,'' <PERSON> Wistrand </PERSON> said. The swampy areas around the launch pad limit the lanes of approach, <PERSON> Wistrand </PERSON> said. In demonstrations two years ago, about 20 people were arrested on space center property, he said. `` What we found is that because of the swamps, which include alligators, rattlesnakes and wild hogs, they -LRB- demonstrators -RRB- mainly want to stay on the high and dry land,'' he said. `` It made it fairly easy to detect and arrest these people.'' Besides the additional patrols and monitoring devices, the security perimeters have been moved to the outer gates, the adjoining <LOCATION> Banana </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> has been closed to boats, and helicopters with infrared scanners fly over the area. The <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> has several boats in the ocean offshore to enforce the security zone. On launch days, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> provides chase planes to protect the airspace above the shuttle. Though <PERSON> Wistrand </PERSON> refused to divulge how many men are on duty at a time, he has a force of 200 to 225 security guards. `` We've had a number of demonstrations in the past and we've successfully handled those and each time we've made a number of arrests,'' <PERSON> Wistrand </PERSON> said More than 20 anti-nuclear activists used various means to get in at the space center and <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canaveral </LOCATION> Air Force Station in January 1987 to protest the test-firing of a Trident 2 missile.

<HEAD>Cheney Complains of Congressional Interference in Panama Operation</HEAD>

 Congressional limits on covert action thwarted the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration in its handling of the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> crisis, says <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON>, who faults lawmakers for interfering in the White House effort. The former <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> congressman spent much of last week on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> defending the administration against charges it mishandled the abortive coup against <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> dictator Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. In an interview Tuesday with The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> took the offensive, complaining lawmakers' involvement in an area `` really not their bailiwick'' undercut the executive branch's ability to deal with the crisis `` We had situations here where members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> were literally calling agencies downtown, or even people in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, as these events unfolded, demanding information. That creates all kinds of problems,'' <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> said. He declined, however, to name any names among his former colleagues. The <ORGANIZATION> defense </ORGANIZATION> secretary, who served in the House for more than 10 years, said that although members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> have legitimate oversight roles, `` they ought to refrain from trying to intrude in the process while it is still unfolding.'' Adding to the problems of congressional interference were the comments made by lawmakers based on information that was usually `` a small piece of the total picture,'' and in some cases, inaccurate, <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> said. They `` certainly complicate our lives when they run out and make public pronouncements in front of the press, knowing only half of what there is to know,'' the <ORGANIZATION> defense </ORGANIZATION> secretary said. As an example, <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> cited the assertion that <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> was offered to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials. Sen. <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Helms </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.C. </LOCATION>, repeatedly has contended that was the case, although <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> and other administration officials say they've found no evidence that such an offer was ever made. Questioned about clashes this past weekend between the administration and members of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> over restrictions on covert action, <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> said officials have been handcuffed in their ability to act. `` There's no question in my mind that we've reached a point where it is a complicated business to try to function in this area,'' he said. `` There's complications that have developed over the years because of various and sundry rules and restraints.'' Choosing his words carefully after expressing concerns about divulging classified information, <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> described a hypothetical situation in which the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, learning about a planned coup, assesses those involved and their strategy as well as positions its forces. `` You ca n't really do that without congressional approval. These days it's very difficult to get that,'' <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> said. On the defense budget, <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> said he would recommend a presidential veto if <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> negotiators produce legislation that gives inadequate financing to strategic programs such as the B-2 stealth bomber and adds money for weapons <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> has proposed canceling. Asked about calls from congressional Republicans that the administration take a stand on an acceptable budget total for the Strategic Defense Initiative, <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> said the Pentagon was seeking the $ 4.5 billion approved in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> version of the defense authorization bill. He conceded, however, the total may not be possible given the current negotiations with the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, which approved $ 3.1 billion of the $ 4.9 billion <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> requested. `` It's not a matter of our dictating a particular number and saying this is has absolutely got to be.'' Responding to warnings from <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> that a fleet of 132 B-2 bombers at an eventual cost of $ 70 billion is impossible, <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> fired back that if <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> had accepted the budget he proposed in May there would be no problem in funding the program. `` We showed them how to do it,'' he said, referring to his proposed funding for the strategic programs and cancellation of the <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION>' V-22 Osprey, the tilt-rotor aircraft, and the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s F-14D Tomcat jet fighter <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> is looking to restore the two conventional programs.

<HEAD>Congressional Leaders See Gramm-Rudman Cuts Coming</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALAN FRAM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Congressional leaders believe their dispute over the capital gains tax cut pushed by President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is virtually certain to trigger the Gramm-Rudman law's automatic spending cuts next week. Their assessment came Tuesday after <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> leaders of both parties failed again to unravel their differences over the proposed capital gains tax reduction. The argument has delayed <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> debate on a related $ 14 billion deficit-cutting bill. Unless that legislation is passed by Monday, automatic cuts in many defense and domestic programs _ expected to total about $ 16 billion _ will take effect. `` You're not going to avoid'' the cutbacks, <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Minority Leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, R-Kan., said after a nearly two-hour private session `` I think we're all pretty much in agreement on that.'' <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> met in the Capitol with <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Democratic Leader <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Speaker <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>, D-Wash., and <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Minority Leader <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Michel </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Ill </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> said he believed the chances of avoiding the Gramm-Rudman reductions are `` extremely remote The air of defeat has arisen because of the complicated dispute that has tied up congressional leaders for the past week. Republican senators are preparing to force the chamber to vote on a plan to lower the capital gains tax in an effort to honor <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s campaign pledge for a cut in the rate. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> says a rate cut will stimulate economic activity and boost federal revenues. Democratic leaders oppose the idea, arguing it would cost the government billions of dollars in the long run. But the Democratic leadership is on the defensive, realizing that most senators favor some capital gains reduction, and so they are trying to reach an agreement with the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> that would prevent a capital gains amendment _ and other controversial issues _ from being added to the deficit-reduction bill. Attaching capital gains language to the budget bill _ considered an urgent, must-pass measure _ would greatly increase prospects for a cut in the tax rate. Each party has been seeking parliamentary arrangements for voting that would give them procedural advantages in any floor votes. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> also complicated matters last week when it approved an $ 11 billion deficit-slashing bill of its own. That measure included a two-year capital gains cut, a shrinkage of Medicare benefits for extremely ill elderly patients, an expansion of federal day care programs and other initiatives. Working out a way to pare those items from the legislation _ and for the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> to agree to a compromise bill _ makes it all but impossible to finish the task by next Monday, leaders concede. `` The time to have stripped the bill down ... was before we enacted it,'' <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> told reporters. The Gramm-Rudman cuts will be triggered Monday if the projected deficit for the 1990 fiscal year, which began Oct. 1, is not below $ 110 billion. The <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> projected Tuesday that the shortfall will be $ 141.3 billion. This would call for cuts of $ 41.3 billion, divided evenly between defense and domestic programs. The <ORGANIZATION> CBO </ORGANIZATION> projections, however, are merely advisory. The White House's Office of Management and Budget issues its binding projections Monday. They are expected to require about $ 16 billion in cuts, divided equally between defense and domestic programs. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, as it has done in the past, could undo any cuts with future legislation.

 One Canadian school district is selling condoms in high school bathrooms and another will start soon in programs health experts hope will help guard against unwanted pregnancies, AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases. `` They've been installed for two or three weeks,'' says <PERSON> Loretta </PERSON> <PERSON> Nichols </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Qualicum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trustees </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>. `` There's been absolutely no vandalism ... There's been much less concern among the students than there is among the adults.'' <LOCATION> Qualicum </LOCATION>, a semi-rural district on <LOCATION> Vancouver </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, placed the condom vending machines in one boys and one girlrs room in each of its two secondary schools, which some 1,100 students attend. `` We've had excellent family-life programs in place prior to this,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Nichols </PERSON> said in a telephone interview Tuesday. The <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION> school board voted 15-3 recently to install condom vending machines in its 38 secondary schools in a program that could begin by Christmas. Students in <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION> are being taught that the best method for preventing AIDS is abstention but that condoms can cut the risk significantly. The decision was made after Dr. <PERSON> Perry </PERSON> <PERSON> Kendall </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION>'s medical health officer, reported 47 known positive tests for the AIDS virus among local teen-agers between the ages of 15 and 19. He estimated that there may be as many as nine more positive tests for each one known. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, said he knew of no high schools in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> that provide condom-dispensing machines. `` You would have problems in the local communities, etc., etc.,'' he said by telephone. Mrs. <PERSON> Nichols </PERSON> said the decision in <LOCATION> Qualicum </LOCATION> was made strictly for health reasons, without being aware the district would be considered in the vanguard. `` We had no idea whether it was done anywhere else in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, and it really did n't concern us,'' she said. `` The board approached the situation on the basis of health prevention and left the moral aspect completely aside.'' The vote was 6 to 1 in favor. A major factor was that area pharmacies close at 6 p.m. so young people might find it difficult to purchase condoms, Mrs. <PERSON> Nichols </PERSON> said, while life in a small town also might discourage them. `` Because we're a small area, it's difficult for a student to go in to a drugstore and be anonymous,'' she said. The machines that sell condoms for 50 cents each -LRB- 43 cents <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> -RRB- were installed by a supplier on a four-month trial basis. The <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION> district plans to purchase machines for $ 200 each, then sell condoms it buys for 18 cents each at a yet-to-be-determined price. Educational programs are planned for students, teachers and parents before the machines are installed. `` None of us has ignored or downplayed the distress with which some parents will receive this plan,'' <PERSON> Kendall </PERSON> said during the debate. `` Yet in this instance, the harm of not acting far outweighs potential censure.'' He said that teen-agers consider themselves immune to the possibility of getting pregnant or contracting a disease. <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> had reported 3,040 AIDS cases as of Tuesday. `` Encouraging students to buy condoms will not end the misery of unwanted teenage pregnancies, of the transmittal of sexual diseases, of teenage abortions,'' <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Globe </ORGANIZATION> and Mail newspaper said in an editorial. `` It will reduce the numbers, however. `` By addressing the issue openly, schools may give some teen-agers the strength to make protection an issue when considering sexual intercourse, and the knowledge that at least one form of protection is readily available,'' it said. The decision on condom machines is up to local school boards. The <ORGANIZATION> Scarborough </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, which has 24 secondary schools in <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION>'s eastern suburban area, decided against installing the machines. Acquired immune deficiency syndrome is caused by a virus that damages the body's immune system, leaving victims susceptible to infections and cancer. It is spread most often through sexual contact, needles or syringes shared by drug abusers, infected blood or blood products, and from pregnant women to their offspring. The scientific name for the virus is human immunodeficiency virus, or HIV.

<HEAD>Congressman Says Ethics Committee Delaying Decision on Gingrich</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The congressmen who filed an ethics complaint against <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Republican Whip <PERSON> Newt </PERSON> <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON> says the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> ethics committee is delaying a decision on whether to investigate <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON>'s financial dealings. Rep. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON>, D-Ark., complained in a letter to the committee that a <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> law firm hired to recommend whether an investigation should begin has not interviewed many witnesses who are willing to testify against <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON> <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> said Tuesday he had retained his own attorney to review the committee's progress following his complaint that <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> Republican, may have violated <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> rules and campaign finance laws. But, he wrote the committee, it was easier to find evidence supporting his allegations than to find evidence of an investigative effort by the committee-hired firm. The ethics committee _ formally the <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Standards </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Official </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conduct </ORGANIZATION> _ hired <PERSON> Phelan </PERSON>, <PERSON> Pope </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> John </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>, the firm that served as the panel's special counsel in the case against former Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> resigned from <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in June after the committee charged him with 69 rules violations. <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> filed an ethics complaint against <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON> April 11 and amended the document on July 14, but said he has received no response from the committee. The committee denied <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON>'s request for information on the <PERSON> Phelan </PERSON> firm's progress, writing him that <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> rules prohibit disclosure of the information. The complaint said <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON> may have violated campaign finance laws, <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> limits on outside income and a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> rule preventing acceptance of gifts from those with a direct interest in legislation. Many of the allegations center on <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON>'s formation of a partnership, including political supporters, to promote the 1984 book he co-authored, `` Window of Opportunity.'' There also were questions about the use of <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON> staffers to work on the book. <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON> has denied any violations, although he said last month that his congressional staff did clerical work on the book. He said House rules permit such activity as long as the book deals with a public policy issue, and the staffers work at least 40 hours a week on congressional duties.

<HEAD>Battleship Captain Complains of Crew</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The captain of the USS Iowa says the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> staffed his ship with `` dopers, marginal performers'' and other low-quality sailors who had been kicked off other ships, according to a published report. Capt. <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Moosally </PERSON> complained to the officer investigating the turret explosion that killed 47 sailors in April that he believed the ship was `` kind of out of it'' when he took over command in May 1988. The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>, however, said the <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>'s crew was no worse than any other ship's crew. `` I think the battleship has not been properly taken care of as far as manning goes in the wardroom -LRB- the officers on a warship -RRB- or the enlisted area,'' <PERSON> Moosally </PERSON> told Rear Adm. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Milligan </PERSON>, the chief investigator of the <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> explosion. <PERSON> Moosally </PERSON> said some of the sailors sent to the ship were `` dopers, marginal performers, constant UAs -LRB- unauthorized absences -RRB-.'' A transcript of the captain's remarks in the May interview was obtained by the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>, which published them in its Oct. 9 edition. The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> said its investigation concluded the explosion in the gun turret was probably detonated on purpose by a suicidal sailor who was upset at the breakup of a friendship with one sailor and at another shipmate's rejection of his homosexual advances. <PERSON> Milligan </PERSON> asked <PERSON> Moosally </PERSON> why he let sailors with criminal records and disciplinary problems handle ammunition in violation of <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> regulations. <PERSON> Moosally </PERSON> said he would be hard-pressed `` if I was to disqualify all the guys I've got on -LRB- <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> -RRB- that have problems.'' `` I've got guys that were kicked out of submarines, kicked out of SPs -LRB- shore patrol -RRB- that I've got as gunner's mates,'' the captain said. `` That's what the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> sends me.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> denied that low-quality sailors and officers were assigned to the ship. The four battleships in the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> `` get their fair share of the best and worst,'' Lt. Cmdr. <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> Quigley </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, told the newspaper. Adm. <PERSON> L.A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Edney </PERSON>, vice chief of naval operations, wrote in the Oct. 16 edition of <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> that <PERSON> Moosally </PERSON>'s remarks were taken out of context. `` The questioning took place quite soon after the tragedy while both the captain and the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> were searching their minds for possible causes and while the grief he suffered could best be described as an open wound,'' <PERSON> Edney </PERSON> wrote. Earlier this month the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> gave <PERSON> Moosally </PERSON> a letter of caution for violations of training and other regulations that were found during the investigation of the explosion. These violations, the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> said, had nothing to do with the explosion.

<HEAD>Pentagon Spokesman: Decision Not Made On Editors</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> spokesman says a decision on whether to replace military editors at the armed forces newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Stars </ORGANIZATION> and Stripes with civilians wo n't be made until an ombudsman submits a report on the question. The comment by <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> came a day after he told reporters Monday, `` When the current military editors retire, it is our intention to put civilians in there.'' But <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said at a <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> briefing Tuesday, `` I'm not denying anything that I said yesterday. I'm just saying that we do have an ombudsman and it would be well for me to let him make his recommendations first.'' The decision to switch from military to civilian editors would comply with a recommendation in a report last year by the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION>, assisted by the <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Professional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journalists </ORGANIZATION>, reported that it found evidence of censorship and improper management at the government-run daily. The <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> recommended the editor-in-chief be a civilian with solid journalism credentials, rather than a military officer. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>' earlier statement had been warmly greeted by those who have been pressing for such a change, but it apparently caught the ombudsman _ former <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> editor <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Foisie </PERSON> _ off guard. <PERSON> Foisie </PERSON>, reached in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> had `` misspoke.'' `` I think he got confused,'' <PERSON> Foisie </PERSON> said. `` I'm doing a study. I have n't made any report yet. A decision of the kind mentioned by Mr. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> would not be made until my report.'' <PERSON> Foisie </PERSON>, who was appointed last summer to help deal with the allegations of censorship, has been in the <LOCATION> Far </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> for more than two weeks, visiting bureaus of the overseas paper and investigating its problems. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said that even if the changes occur, `` I anticipate that there will always be a military commander of the newspaper. Now, how you divide up editorial responsibilities is something that we're asking Mr. <PERSON> Foisie </PERSON> to advise us on.'' Although frequently referred to as one newspaper, the Stars and Stripes is published in two separate editions by largely autonomous bureaus in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>.

 Producers of the blood and <PERSON> gore </PERSON> sequel `` <LOCATION> Leatherface </LOCATION>: The <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Chainsaw Massacre III'' hope to chop off its X rating in the editing room and turn it into an R-rated massacre. New Line Cinema will resubmit the film Oct. 17 in an effort to win the less restrictive rating from the <ORGANIZATION> Motion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Picture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Classification </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Rating Administration. `` Some adjustments have been made.

New Line planned to release the slaughterfest starring <PERSON> Kate </PERSON> <PERSON> Hodge </PERSON> and <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Butler </PERSON> on Nov. 3. The New York-based motion picture association, which issues movie ratings as a guideline to parents, does n't discuss reasons for its ratings decisions or comment on what scene or scenes are deemed objectionable. An R rating lets those under age 17 to see the film if accompanied by an adult. Only adults are allowed in for movies rated X, the most restrictive audience category and deemed a financial death sentence for mainstream movies. `` The <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Chainsaw Massacre'' was released in 1974 by <ORGANIZATION> Bryanston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pictures </ORGANIZATION> and was rated R. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chainsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Massacre </ORGANIZATION> 2'' was n't submitted to the association for a rating when it was released in 1986 by Cannon.

<TEXT>
 Drug traffickers claimed responsibility for the assassination of two employees of a crusading anti-drug newspaper and threatened to kill its remaining 11 workers in <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> if they do n't leave. A magazine journalist and four other people also were gunned down Tuesday in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s cocaine trafficking capital. The shootings in <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> followed 13 bombings in three other <LOCATION> Colombian </LOCATION> cities late Monday and early Tuesday _ the most serious rash of attacks since the country's drug lords went to war with the government nearly two months ago. Last month, a car bomb exploded outside the main officies in <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION> of the 102-year-old <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Espectador </ORGANIZATION> newspaper, injuring scores of bystanders and causing extensive damage. In a telephone call to <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Espectador </LOCATION>, a man said a group called The Extraditables would kill the 11 members of the paper's <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> staff if they did not leave the city in three days, an editor at the paper said. The staff is composed of journalists, secretaries and administrative workers. The anonymous caller said The Extraditables was responsible for Tuesday's assassinations in <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> of the paper's administrator and circulation manager for the city of 2 million, said the editor, who asked not to be identified for security reasons. Drug traffickers have issued statements under the name The Extraditables. The country's top cocaine barons fear extradition to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, which seeks to put them on trial. In announcing the anti-drug campaign, President <PERSON> Virgilio </PERSON> <PERSON> Barco </PERSON> put in place emergency decrees restoring an extradition treaty with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and empowering security forces to seize the property of cocaine bosses. Millions of dollars in property allegedly belonging to the traffickers has since been seized, but only one reputed high-level drug figure has been extradited to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Killed within an hour of each other Tuesday afternoon were <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Espectador </ORGANIZATION>'s administrator, <PERSON> Martha </PERSON> <PERSON> Luz </PERSON> <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON>, 35, and its circulation manager, <PERSON> Miguel </PERSON> <PERSON> Soler </PERSON>, 45. Both employees were shot by unidentified gunmen traveling on motocycles. Police said gunmen later Tuesday killed <PERSON> Roberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Sarasty </PERSON>, the 55-year-old director of <ORGANIZATION> Cronista </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratica </ORGANIZATION> magazine, while he was walking on a downtown street with another journalist. His companion was slightly wounded. At about the same time, another group fired at a crowd at a bar in Manrique, a northern <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> barrio, killing four people before fleeing. <PERSON> Manrique </PERSON> is a known recruiting ground for `` sicarios,'' or assassins used by drug traffickers. Police said that they not been able to establish the motives for the killings of Sarasty or the four people in <LOCATION> Manrique </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Espectador </ORGANIZATION> editor denied local radio reports that the paper's owner had decided to close the <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> offices because of the assassinations and threats. However, one of the paper's owners, speaking in <LOCATION> Monterrey </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, at the annual conference of the <ORGANIZATION> Inter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, said <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Espectador </ORGANIZATION> may close its <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> office. `` I do n't know if we'll be able to continue operating in <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> under present conditions,'' said <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Gabriel </PERSON> <PERSON> Cano </PERSON>, whose brother, <PERSON> Guillermo </PERSON> <PERSON> Cano </PERSON>, was killed by cocaine traffickers on Dec. 17, 1986. <PERSON> Cano </PERSON> also said the paper, founded in <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> in 1887, may have to close eventually because of financial problems caused by the bombing last month. A senior <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Espectador </ORGANIZATION> reporter, asking not to be identified, said in a telephone interview that none of the paper's 1,200 employees have quit, although many had received death threats. The reporter said drug traffickers were trying to destroy the paper by decimating its staff and that more assassinations may occur. `` Security ca n't be increased any more. We've already got 50 soldiers guarding our facilities, bodyguards for all our managers and dynamite-sniffing dogs roaming our halls,'' he said. `` What else can be done?'' <PERSON> El </PERSON> <PERSON> Espectador </PERSON> has been a strong supporter of the government's anti-drug offensive, which began after the assassination Aug. 18 of leading presidential candidate <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Galan </PERSON> In an effort to help the newspaper survive, many <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> papers have expressed support through large paid advertisements placed in the paper.

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The dollar gained ground against the Japanese yen Wednesday despite the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION>'s raising of its discount rate, while the key index on the <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> plunged. The <ORGANIZATION> Nikkei </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> lost 136.28 points, or 0.39 percent, ending at 35,240.07 points. It had gained 167.00 points Monday. Stock and foreign currency markets were closed Tuesday for a national holiday. Stock dealers attributed the index's fall to the yen's sharp decline in earlier trading, as well as the central bank's discount rate hike. The dollar, which opened higher at 144.90 yen, ended at 143.90 yen, up 1.67 yen from Monday's close of 142.23 yen. It moved between 142.55 yen and 144.95 yen. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> currency started to fall in earlier trading after rumors the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> might raise its discount rate, traders said. The <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> raised its official discount rate by 0.5 percent to 3.75 percent shortly after the morning markets closed Wednesday, central bank officials confirmed. The new rate became effective as soon as it was announced at 12:45 p.m., a bank official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. This was the second increase in the key lending rate this year. The previous hike went into effect May 30, bringing the rate to 3.25 percent, to stem inflation and strengthen the yen, which has fallen against the dollar in recent months. `` The decision came in consideration of recent currency market fluctuations, movements in foreign interest rates, domestic economic trends, consumer prices and the money supply,'' the central bank said in a statement released after its announcement Wednesday. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> hopes the rate hike will stabilize consumer prices and encourage the continued growth of domestic demand,'' the statement said. Expected increases in interest rates on savings accounts at banks had not yet been determined, the official added. The rate is currently at 0.26 percent.

 A federal appeals court has upheld the constitutionality of an <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> policy that denies financial aid to private groups supporting abortions in foreign countries.

<HEAD>Safety Regulations for Microwave Packaging Considered</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Heat-sensitive food packaging materials designed for microwave cooking will be evaluated by the <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> for potential new safety regulations. The <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday it is asking for information about heat susceptors, metalized surfaces in the packages of food intended for microwave cooking. These heat susceptors absorb microwave energy and become very hot, allowing the food to become brown and crisp. Because the susceptors become so hot, the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> said it is concerned that other parts of the package, including adhesives, polymers, paper and components of plastic films, may migrate into the food at high levels.

 <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> had seven of network television's top 10 programs last week but <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> narrowly rode `` The Cosby Show'' and the baseball playoffs into first place in the <ORGANIZATION> A.C. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nielsen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> ratings. <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> finished within 0.8 point of <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>, and its `` Roseanne'' was the highest rated program of the week. <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> has the contract to carry the World Series between the <ORGANIZATION> Oakland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Athletics </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Francisco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Giants </ORGANIZATION>. The last such regional contest in 1985, between the <ORGANIZATION> Kansas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Royals </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Louis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cardinals </ORGANIZATION>, went seven games and was a ratings winner for <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>. But the A's - <ORGANIZATION> Giants </ORGANIZATION> contest has the disadvantage of being on the That means all the games will have to start two hours before prime time, at 5 p.m. in their respective cities, so <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> viewers can catch the first pitch at 8 p.m. `` This World Series is not a regional matchup,'' insisted <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Hara </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s director of sports programming. `` The two teams are national attractions with very recognizable superstars.'' `` If <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> called us up and said, ` Hey, we do n't like this Oakland-Giants matchup,' we'd take it,'' said <PERSON> Preston </PERSON> <PERSON> Beckman </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s vice president of sports audience research. <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> led the three networks for the 68th consecutive week, with an average rating of 15.2 to <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s 14.4 and CBS' 12.5. The ratings are the percentage of the estimated 90.4 million homes with television sets in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Here are last week's top 10 shows: `` Roseanne,'' <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>; `` The Cosby Show,'' <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>; `` The Wonder Years,'' <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>; `` NBC Monday Night at the Movies: `` A Cry for Help: The Tracy Thurman Story''; `` Who's the Boss? <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>; `` <ORGANIZATION> NFL </ORGANIZATION> Monday Night Football, <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> vs. <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>,'' <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>; `` Chicken Soup,'' <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>; `` Growing Pains,'' <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>; `` Head of the Class,'' <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>; and `` Murder, She Wrote,'' CBS. National League games did better than <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> contests during the playoffs, with the Giants-Cubs matches on Sunday and Thursday nights tying for 12th place in the ratings. The first game for the National League series, on Wednesday night, was in 17th place while the third game on Saturday night was No. 19. Two American League games were played in prime time, with the Tuesday night game between the <ORGANIZATION> Athletics </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Toronto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Blue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jays </ORGANIZATION> in 36th place and the Friday game at No. 38. `` One of the two teams in the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> was a Canadian team, so you do n't have the benefit of two markets in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Beckman </PERSON> of the lower American League ratings. He said the American League also tends to draw lower ratings. Also during the week, a rare interview with <PERSON> Marlon </PERSON> <PERSON> Brando </PERSON> failed to lift the sagging `` Saturday Night With <PERSON> Connie </PERSON> <PERSON> Chung </PERSON>.'' The CBS show tied for 68th place. The bottom 10 network shows, from the lowest: `` Championship Baseball Preview _ American League,'' -LRB- Friday night -RRB- <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>; `` Saturday Night With <PERSON> Connie </PERSON> <PERSON> Chung </PERSON>,'' CBS; `` Championship Baseball Preview _ National League,'' -LRB- Saturday night -RRB- <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>; `` Mr. <PERSON> Belvedere </PERSON>,'' <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>; `` <ORGANIZATION> NFL </ORGANIZATION> Live Extra,'' <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>; `` Tour of Duty,'' CBS; `` Championship Baseball Preview _ American League,'' -LRB- Tuesday night -RRB- NBC; `` Living Dolls,'' <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>; `` Snoops,'' CBS; `` Primetime Live,'' <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>.

 The widow of a rebel <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> captain vowed at his funeral to obtain justice for the man she said was killed in prison after the failed attempt to topple Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. `` I will shout it to the world until justice is done and the truth is known,'' <PERSON> Luz </PERSON> <PERSON> Elaine </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> said Tuesday as she dried tears from her eyes at her husband's coffin. She denied rumors that Capt. <PERSON> Nicasio </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> had hanged himself after the coup attempt Oct. 3. The coroner's report said he died of asphyxiation. At the funeral, she called him `` a very <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> man, a god to his children, and they are not going to sully his name.'' <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON>, 36, was one of 27 officers arrested after the coup attempt. He was an adjutant to former intelligence chief Col. <PERSON> Guillermo </PERSON> <PERSON> Wong </PERSON>, who was also jailed. Eight rebel officers were killed on the day of the coup, when troops loyal to <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> put down the rebellion. The government has denied reports some coup leaders were executed after they surrendered. America <PERSON> Torres </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> McEnfresh </PERSON>, <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON>'s mother-in-law, said the family was told Monday morning by the district attorney's office to pick up his body at the morgue. `` I saw him for the last time on Tuesday morning -LRB- Oct. 3 -RRB-,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> said. `` He did what he always did. He went jogging, came back dressed in civilian clothes, very sporty, we kissed and then he left at about 7:30 a.m.'' `` He never would have committed suicide,'' she told reporters. `` He was a religious man. He taught us to love God. None took food here without blessing it first.'' Also Tuesday, the government took new steps against critics of <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, decreeing after a Cabinet meeting that government employees who take part in `` anti-government activities'' may be fired. Many government employees were reported to have celebrated and taunted their supervisors while rebels held the military headquarters on Oct. 3, thinking the coup had been a success. The government also decreed laws Tuesday that freeze wages of public employees and cancel Christmas and year-end bonuses. In another move against a perennial critic, the government eliminated the Education Ministry's national personnel board, which assigned teaching positions. A communique said the new laws were intended to protect `` the economy and the national security from the aggression of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government the past two years.'' `` They are repressive measures,'' said <PERSON> Ricardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> <PERSON> Calderon </PERSON>, leader of the opposition <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrat </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. `` I think they are the first steps toward developing a police state.'' <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, in announcing last week that the laws were forthcoming, said `` here there will be no room for traitors nor jobs for the traitors,'' an apparent reference to the government employees. As chief of the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> is the real power in the government. Also Tuesday, the government said it will send representatives to the Oct. 23-28 meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> Panama </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Canal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>'s board of directors in <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla </LOCATION>. It had boycotted the last two meetings of the joint U.S.-Panamanian board, saying <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> might bring up the political conflict between the two countries. Since <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> was indicted in February 1988 on charges of smuggling drugs into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and laundering drug money, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> has been applying economic sanctions and other pressures on <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> to force <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> out. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> denies involvement in drug trafficking and claims the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is trying to force him out because it wants to renege on 1977 treaties that cede control of the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION> by the end of the century.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has accepted an invitation to attend a drug summit with the leaders of the world's three largest coca-producing countries, who pledged all-out war on traffickers during talks in this desert city. The presidents of <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>, in a five-hour meeting Tuesday, invited <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and European leaders to take part in the summit, to be held within the next 90 days in <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, White House press secretary <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said: `` The president will go.'' He said 90 days was `` within the time frame we have been considering. It's reasonable.'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> had no objection to participation by Europeans and security concerns would not stand in the way of a summit. Of a planning meeting Nov. 20, he said: `` I'm sure that's fine with us. At their meeting, Presidents <PERSON> Jaime </PERSON> <PERSON> Paz </PERSON> <PERSON> Zamora </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Virgilio </PERSON> <PERSON> Barco </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION> also questioned <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> reliance on military and police actions to stem the cocaine trade. In a brief communique at the end of their session to develop a common strategy to fight drugs, the presidents said both the production and consumption of cocaine must be addressed at the summit. They also pledged to continue `` all-out war'' on trafficking. In the statement, the presidents said a successful anti-narcotics campaign must, in addition to seeking punitive measures against drug traffickers, also deal with production and consumption of drugs. They did not elaborate in their statement. However, <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION> have said military-style repression of the drug trade should be accompanied by more <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economic aid to provide alternative crops or sources of income for the hundreds of thousands of peasants who grow coca. In August, <PERSON> Barco </PERSON> began a crackdown on Colombian cocaine barons, who oversee the smuggling of most of the cocaine that reaches the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. He has received $ 65 million worth of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military aid to help in the effort. <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> has urged <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> leaders to join the war against cocaine. He has warned that if the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is successful in slowing the influx of cocaine, traffickers will shift their focus to <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION> are the world's three major coca-producing countries. Coca is a raw material used to make cocaine. About 300 soldiers guarded <PERSON> Ica </PERSON>'s elegant <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dunas </LOCATION> hotel, where the meeting took place and about 3,000 plainclothes policemen circulated in this city of 350,000 people 180 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION>. The heavy security was to defend against any attacks by the leftist <ORGANIZATION> Shining </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Path </ORGANIZATION> guerrilla group, which works in alliance with cocaine traffickers in <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Upper </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Huallaga </LOCATION> <LOCATION> river </LOCATION> <LOCATION> valley </LOCATION>, source of most of the world's coca leaf. Tuesday's one-day drug meeting was to precede a larger meeting today of seven <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> presidents, who were expected to expel <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> from a regional organization called the Group of Eight. A bomb exploded before dawn Tuesday in Trujillo, the northern Peruvian city where five regional foreign ministers were meeting to prepare the agenda for the three-day regional summit. It exploded at the offices of a public housing agency, damaging the building but causing no injuries. Police said no group claimed responsibility. In <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION>, leftist guerrillas killed a governing party candidate for a municipal council Tuesday night and rebels set off a car bomb that wounded one person, police said. There was no claim of responsibility. At today's summit, the leaders of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Uruguay </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> will join <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> and Barco in <ORGANIZATION> Ica </ORGANIZATION> to discuss <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s conflicts, drug trafficking, foreign debt and environmental damage to the <LOCATION> Amazon </LOCATION> jungle. They were to debate <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s membership in the <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eight </ORGANIZATION>, which has already suspended <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> from participation to protest the leadership of Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. `` We can not permit a country like <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> that scoffs at and ridicules the democratic system to continue with us,'' Foreign Minister <PERSON> Guillermo </PERSON> <PERSON> Larco </PERSON> <PERSON> Cox </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION> said Tuesday in Trujillo.

 Along the 10,000-foot ridges of central <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Tien </PERSON> <PERSON> Shan </PERSON> mountains, where few Westerners have set foot, veterans of the <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> wars shared battlefield memories and a desire for peace. The Americans, most of them former <ORGANIZATION> Marines </ORGANIZATION>, Special Forces troops or paratroopers, recalled how fellow soldiers in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> were killed or wounded by gunfire from AK-47 assault rifles, supplied by the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. Soviet veterans, also from elite combat units, offered similar accounts of how their comrades fell victim to hand-held Stinger missiles that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> had shipped to the Afghan rebels. `` We talked about that quite openly,'' said <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Rheault </PERSON>, the leader of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> group, `` and then we'd think about what would happen if we started shooting at each other with our own weapons. `` We'd end the planet,'' said the retired <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> colonel. For eight days last month, about 35 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet veterans trekked across some of the world's most spectacular and forbidding terrain in an expedition that reflected the spirit of glasnost, the Soviet's policy of openness that is responsible for a growing number of exchange programs. Earthstewards Network of <LOCATION> Bainbridge </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION>, a non-profit, educational group that seeks to promote citizen diplomacy, had invited <PERSON> Rheault </PERSON> to lead the expedition and recruit participants. A Soviet veterans' group organized the itinerary; the Americans had no idea of their destination until they arrived. `` It was a great adventure,'' said retired Lt. Gen. <PERSON> Hal </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>, who commanded a 1st Cavalry Division battalion in the Ia <LOCATION> Drang </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>, the landmark 1965 battle between <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and North Vietnamese forces. <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>, 67, of Crested Butte, <LOCATION> Colo. </LOCATION>, was surprised at the ease with which he and the other Americans were accepted by the younger Soviet veterans. Many of the Americans were a generation older. `` They called me their brother, and they wanted me to call them my little brothers,'' <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> said. `` I thought they might call me ` grandfather'.'' The route traversed a range of remote and barren mountains that cuts across western <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> into the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> east of <LOCATION> Tashkent </LOCATION>. Despite language barriers _ each group had two interpreters _ and the age differences, the former soldiers forged a common bond, according to members of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> contingent. Attitudes toward the respective wars were strikingly similar, <PERSON> Rheault </PERSON> said, citing the example of one of the Soviets, who displayed knife wounds from hand-to-hand combat in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. The Soviets completed their troop withdrawal from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> earlier this year. `` He was proud of having been a good soldier, but he was not happy at having been sent to fight that stupid war,'' <PERSON> Rheault </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Rheault </PERSON>, a former commander of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Special Forces troops, is no stranger to controversy. He and five Green Beret subordinates were arrested by the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> in 1969 on charges of killing a South Vietnamese civilian who was an alleged double agent. <PERSON> Rheault </PERSON> was jailed 70 days before the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> abruptly dropped the charges. <PERSON> Rheault </PERSON> went on to develop innovative outdoor adventure programs at the Hurricane Island Outward Bound School in <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>. He said the <PERSON> Tien </PERSON> <PERSON> Shan </PERSON> expedition reinforced the belief that communication improves hopes for peace between the superpowers. At the end of a day's climb, the <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> veterans sang `` Where Have All the Flowers Gone'' and other songs of the era. The Soviets shared their protest songs, including the mournful `` Black Tulip,'' which took its name from the helicopter that lifted out bodies of dead Soviet soldiers. `` We had so much in common that it transcended our differences,'' said the 63-year-old <PERSON> Rheault </PERSON>. `` We certainly felt a lot closer to each other than any of us felt to our own politicians.''

 Rock fans and opera lovers were enthusiastic about the world premiere of an opera written by <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON> <PERSON> Copeland </PERSON>, the former drummer with the rock group Police. A newspaper review, though, was n't so kind. The idea of a rock star moving into the opera world is `` very exciting,'' said 22-year-old <PERSON> Brent </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Painesville </LOCATION>, a longtime fan. `` He's bringing new ideas to high opera,'' said <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, dressed for Tuesday night's premiere in a tuxedo and red bow tie. A companion, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Dunham </PERSON>, 28, also of <LOCATION> Painesville </LOCATION>, said the opera `` Holy Blood and <PERSON> Crescent </PERSON> <PERSON> Moon </PERSON>,'' was `` a good mix for new people. You need that.'' <PERSON> Dunham </PERSON>, a fan of opera, said that the `` orchestrated score needs a little work. The actual singing is good.'' But a reviewer for The Plain Dealer newspaper found problems. `` Copeland's score rises only at a few isolated moments to anything that makes us care about his characters. It is full of nervous orchestral busy-work,'' the review said. <PERSON> Dunham </PERSON> said the capacity audience at the ornate State Theater included many more young people than the typical opera audience. `` I would n't expect to see them here for ` <PERSON> Carmen </PERSON>,''' he said. <PERSON> Copeland </PERSON>, who spent six years with Police and later wrote scores for movies and television shows, took four years to write `` Holy Blood and <PERSON> Crescent </PERSON> <PERSON> Moon </PERSON>,'' a tale of the Crusades in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>. The 37-year-old decided to write an opera on a lark in 1984, while he was composing music for a ballet for <PERSON> Shakespeare </PERSON>'s King <PERSON> Lear </PERSON> for the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ballet </LOCATION>.

 <ORGANIZATION> Jupiter </ORGANIZATION>'s Great Red Spot is getting redder following a color change by a 6,200-mile-wide belt of clouds, scientists said as <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> prepares for the <ORGANIZATION> Galileo </ORGANIZATION>'s six-year mission to the planet. `` This is a dynamical, neat place to look at. It's changing and doing wild things on a huge scale,'' said <PERSON> Rita </PERSON> <PERSON> Beebe </PERSON>, an astronomer at <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mexico </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. British astronomer G.M. <PERSON> Hurst </PERSON> on July 16 first noticed that <ORGANIZATION> Jupiter </ORGANIZATION>'s 6,200-mile-wide <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Equatorial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Belt </ORGANIZATION> was changing from brown to white. Since then, the <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Red </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Spot </LOCATION> _ a hurricane almost twice <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>'s size that faded to dim gray in 1976 _ has been returning gradually to its brick red color, <PERSON> Beebe </PERSON> said Tuesday by phone from <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cruces </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.M. </LOCATION> `` The Red Spot appears to be darkening. Color seems to be coming back,'' said <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Meara </PERSON>, an associate editor at <ORGANIZATION> Sky </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Telescope magazine in <LOCATION> Cambridge </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass </LOCATION>. `` Some observe it as orange; some pink. It has a pale luster.'' The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> had hoped to launch space shuttle Atlantis on Thursday carrying the <ORGANIZATION> Galileo </ORGANIZATION> probe into <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> orbit, where it will be deployed on its flight to <LOCATION> Jupiter </LOCATION>. But the agency late Tuesday delayed the launch at least until at least Monday because of a computer problem aboard the shuttle. Scientists study weather on Jupiter and other planets to understand Earth's climate and rules governing weather on planets, said <PERSON> Beebe </PERSON>, who watches Jupiter using a 24-inch telescope at her university's Tortugas Mountain Observatory near <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cruces </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Galileo </ORGANIZATION> will examine <ORGANIZATION> Jupiter </ORGANIZATION>'s vast storms and jetstream-like belts when it arrives in 1995 at the solar system's largest planet, which is 11 times wider than <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> and 318 times heavier. The Great Red Spot, which is at least 350 years old and measures about 12,400 miles east to west and 6,200 miles north to south, is continuing to get redder and about six months from now `` will settle down as a beautiful oval red spot,'' <PERSON> Beebe </PERSON> said. The darkening is being caused by the changing color of the <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Equatorial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Belt </ORGANIZATION>, which sits just north of the spot, she said. The belt faded from brown to white in the early 1970s, then turned brown again in 1974, said <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> <PERSON> Orton </PERSON>, a planetary scientist at <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION>'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in <LOCATION> Pasadena </LOCATION>. It appears brown when sunlight hits natural gas, or methane, and ammonia to create yellow-brown photochemical smog, which drifts down in <ORGANIZATION> Jupiter </ORGANIZATION>'s atmosphere and absorbs light hitting the atmosphere, <PERSON> Beebe </PERSON> said. She said the belt changes to white when <ORGANIZATION> Jupiter </ORGANIZATION>'s internal heat pushes enough ammonia ice crystals upward, where winds up to 330 mph spread the crystals out to form a white deck of light-reflecting cirrus clouds. <PERSON> Beebe </PERSON> said that when the belt is brown, eddies in its winds start feeding ammonia ice crystals into the Great Red Spot, so white ice washes out the red color.

He found the Southern Equatorial Belt had cooled considerably, showing icy clouds were blocking heat from warmer atmospheric gases below. <PERSON> Beebe </PERSON> said the belt will turn brown again within about 18 months as violent storms mix atmospheric gases.

 Police found the bound bodies of 80 murdered young Sinhalese men along a road in southern <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION> today, a day before the final round of peace talks to try to resolve ethnic conflicts that have claimed more than 16,000 lives. The bodies were found along a 20-mile stretch of road between the towns of <LOCATION> Panadura </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Mataguma </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Kalutara </LOCATION> district, 25 miles south of <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION>, said police officials who can not be identified under briefing rules. The victims, all between age 18 and 30, had their hands tied behind their backs before they were shot to death, police said. The bodies, some of them burning, were found in groups of six or eight, they said. No one claimed responsibility for the massacre, one of the worst this year. But authorities blamed pro-government death squads seeking revenge for the murder Monday of three Sinhalese soldiers in <LOCATION> Kalutara </LOCATION> district. Authorities claimed the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> ambushed the soldiers while they were on patrol. Human rights groups and opposition politicians have alleged that vigilante groups are killing sympathizers of the front, an extremist Sinhalese group trying to overthrow the government. President <PERSON> Ranasinghe </PERSON> <PERSON> Premadasa </PERSON> and his government have denied the charge and have invited the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> to monitor their human rights practices. The front has been attacking the Sinhalese-dominated government since the signing of a peace accord in July 1987 designed to give greater autonomy to the island nation's Tamil minority. After <PERSON> Premadasa </PERSON> took office in January, the bloody conflict within the <LOCATION> Indian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> island nation's Sinhalese majority instensified, claiming an average of 25 lives every day. More than 5,000 people have died in the past two years in central and southern <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>, where most of the country's Sinhalese majoriy live Another 11,000 have died in the northeast, where most Tamils live and where Tamil guerrillas have been waging a 6-year-old battle for a separate homeland. The <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> espouses Marxism but increasingly has taken up a banner of ultra-nationalism for the Sinhalese, who are mostly Buddhists and comprise 75 percent of the country's 16 million people. Tamils account for 18 percent of the population and are mainly Hindus. Last month, <PERSON> Premadasa </PERSON> convened a peace conference of 21 of the country's 27 recognized political parties. Tamil guerrilla groups, including the largest and most militant <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tigers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tamil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eelam </ORGANIZATION>, participated in the meeting. The front, however, boycotted the talks. The conference is scheduled to hold its final round of talks on Thursday.

District Judge <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Staker </PERSON> gave <PERSON> Clary </PERSON> a concurrent term of four years and three months on cocaine distribution charges. `` It is for that child that I make these sentences run concurrently,'' <PERSON> Staker </PERSON> said.

 Colombian police and soldiers, working sometimes in concert with drug traffickers and paramilitary groups, have illegally killed 2,500 people in 17 months, <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> said today. An additional 250 victims disappeared after being taken into custody in 1988 and the first five months of this year, and some were tortured while being held, the international human rights group said in a report. Amnesty said that last year alone, it documented more than 30 group killings in which a total of 350 people died. It said local rights groups estimate more than 70 incidents occurred involving groups of five or more victims. Victims have included trade union leaders, human rights workers, teachers, priests, peasants and, more recently, members of the judiciary trying to investigate rights abuses, it said. Many recent mass killings appear to have been part of a campaign to eliminate people thought to support opposition parties, London-based <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> said. `` Available information on the organization and functioning of so-called death squads provides compelling evidence that paramilitary forces form an integral part of a counterinsurgency program adopted by the Colombian armed forces _ often operating with powerful drug groups _ designed to eliminate perceived opponents without recourse to the law,'' the report said. In one of the worst cases, it said 43 people, including three children, were massacred in <LOCATION> Segovia </LOCATION>, a gold-mining town in <LOCATION> Antioquia </LOCATION> province, by heavily armed men who arrived in in pickup trucks on Nov. 11, 1988. Some assailants were reportedly hooded and in camouflage uniform. Amnesty said preliminary judicial investigations established that army and police personnel were directly responsible for preparing the attack, which was apparently directed at supporters of the opposition group <ORGANIZATION> Patriotic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>. It said <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> overruled a military court's claim of jurisdiction and handed the case back to the civilian court that had been pursuing it A civilian court judge investigating the case is one of several judges who received death threats in recent months, it said. Other members of the judiciary were killed, including two civilian judges investigating alleged rights abuses. Amnesty said it welcomed measures by President <PERSON> Virgilio </PERSON> <PERSON> Barco </PERSON> to combat drug traffickers, but was concerned that `` equally vigorous measures'' were not announced against members of the armed forces and paramilitary groups accused of systematic rights violations. It said civilian members and supporters of paramilitary `` death squads'' have declared their intention to continue their activities. Amnesty asked <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> to ensure strict control over all branches of the police and security forces and take whatever steps are needed to ensure they act within the law. It said that where evidence exists of security force personnel involvement in rights abuses, perpetrators must be prosecuted and judiciary officials investigating alleged rights abuses must be given protection and resources.

 You'd have to wonder about a guy who claimed he was a <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> spy, a mobster, a doctor, the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>'s youngest major general, <PERSON> Elvis </PERSON> <PERSON> Presley </PERSON>'s pal and a hero who rescued scores of POWs from <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>. His girlfriend did, and after she checked <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lyons </PERSON>' story with the <ORGANIZATION> Secret </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, they arrested him. <PERSON> Lyons </PERSON>, a 35-year-old Mission, <LOCATION> Kan. </LOCATION>, salesman of water purification systems pleaded guilty in July to impersonating a <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> agent and a major general and was sentenced Tuesday to 15 months of psychiatric treatment. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Earl </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> said <PERSON> Lyons </PERSON> has `` a history of falsehoods that ca n't be substantiated other than through his words.'' <PERSON> Lyons </PERSON>' ex-girlfriend, <PERSON> Beth </PERSON> <PERSON> Hannah </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Overland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Lyons </PERSON> was charming, quick-witted, and full of stories. `` He was a gentleman,'' she said. `` He always held the door open.'' Ms. <PERSON> Hannah </PERSON>, 45, nearly married him, and <PERSON> Cindy </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON>, 35, also of <LOCATION> Overland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>, did. Both suffered financially for believing his stories and both attended his sentencing. `` He was a master of manipulation,'' Ms. <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> said, `` an absolute master.'' `` He would make a tremendous writer,'' Ms. <PERSON> Hannah </PERSON> said. `` It's a waste.'' Ms. <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> recalled, `` <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> was constantly lying. He would go from day to day, minute to minute, building one story on another.'' <PERSON> Lyons </PERSON> left the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> as a private, but he wrote an article about himself in a bogus newsletter. The story recounts how General <PERSON> Lyons </PERSON> led a commando team in 1983 to <LOCATION> Southeast </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>, rescued 285 prisoners of war and returned with the remains of 300 servicemen. It said he received two Medals of Honor and was awaiting a third. Ms. <PERSON> Hannah </PERSON>, who knew little of government and the military, said <PERSON> Lyons </PERSON> laced his lies with enough detail to make them sound true. By late January, less than a month after they met, she gave <PERSON> Lyons </PERSON> $ 1,000 to pay his debts. Ms. <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> met <PERSON> Lyons </PERSON> at a restaurant in 1981. She had arrived there and saw a former boyfriend with a nicely groomed man who identified himself as Dr. <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Lyons </PERSON>. In the weeks to come, Ms. <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> said, <PERSON> Lyons </PERSON> kept making excuses to see or call her. At such meetings, he would mention that he flew helicopters, designed vacuum cleaners and sold insurance. One day, she said, <PERSON> Lyons </PERSON> came to her house saying he wanted to come clean: His first name was <PERSON> Robert </PERSON>, not <PERSON> Pat </PERSON>, and his stories about being a doctor were false. He said he had no choice but to lie because he was trying to protect his real identity as a member of the <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> mob. Another day, Ms. <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> said, they drove to a carwash, where <PERSON> Lyons </PERSON> jumped a track and smashed her <LOCATION> Pontiac </LOCATION> into a post. He promised that his insurance policy would pay for the damage and said the mob had arranged the wreck. Ms. <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> agreed to marry <PERSON> Lyons </PERSON> in 1981 because he said the mob would leave them alone once he married. `` I had to get married because I wanted my family left alone,'' she said. `` I wanted my cake decorating shop left alone.'' But during 18 months of marriage, Ms. <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> said, she was forced to sell her furniture and close her business to appease creditors. `` I was watching my life being destroyed,'' she said. Ultimately, <PERSON> Lyons </PERSON> confessed that he had lied about his life as a mobster. Ms. <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> threw <PERSON> Lyons </PERSON> out of their house, divorced him and later had the marriage annulled. <PERSON> Hannah </PERSON> said she became suspicious when a neighbor saw <PERSON> Lyons </PERSON>' resume and doubted his claims The neighbor called the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION>, where authorities said they had never heard of <PERSON> Lyons </PERSON>. She then called the <ORGANIZATION> Secret </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. During the hearing, <PERSON> Lyons </PERSON>' attorney, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Gerstle </PERSON>, described his client as `` an individual who has severe problems and enormous emotional problems.'' `` This has been a long, trying five months for ... my family, my friends,'' <PERSON> Lyons </PERSON> said. `` I'm sorry for this episode and the entire train of events.''

<TEXT>
 Authorities are investigating whether a man whose body was found near railroad tracks was traveling with four others found dead in a trailer being carried on a railroad flatcar. The four, thought to be illegal aliens, were found Tuesday morning on the <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> train, and authorities were trying to determine if a toxic pesticide used on the cargo contributed to their deaths. Later, authorities found the body of a man also believed to be an illegal alien beside the tracks just south of <LOCATION> Sinton </LOCATION>, 65 miles south of <LOCATION> Victoria </LOCATION>, authorities said Tuesday night. <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Patricio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Sheriff <PERSON> Leroy </PERSON> <PERSON> Moody </PERSON> said it's possible the man died in the same railroad car and fell out. <ORGANIZATION> Moody </ORGANIZATION> said a crewman on a <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> train spotted the fifth body about 10 feet from the tracks Tuesday afternoon. Autopsies on all five were ordered. The trailer, half-filled with boxes of tortilla or corn flour called masa, had two warning stickers about the size of license plates taped to the doors. The signs showed skulls and said in English and Spanish: `` Danger. This trailer is being fumigated,'' and `` Do not enter.'' The masa had been fumigated with <PERSON> Phostoxin </PERSON>, an aluminum phosphate pesticide, before the trailer was sealed and loaded on the train in <LOCATION> Harlingen </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Jorge </PERSON> <PERSON> Trevino </PERSON>, quality control manager for the flour producer, <ORGANIZATION> Azteca </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Milling </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Edinburg </LOCATION>. The pesticides are used on masa shipments to keep the food free of rodents and bugs. <PERSON> Trevino </PERSON> did not know when a contractor had treated and sealed the trailer, which measured about 40 feet long, 8 feet tall and 10 feet wide. <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuddeback </PERSON>, an investigator with the <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION>, said the fumigant used in the trailer could be fatal if inhaled or ingested. The four apparently died of asphyxiation despite punching a small hole in the trailer, probably for ventilation, said <LOCATION> Victoria </LOCATION> police Lt. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>. Three rescue workers and seven police officers at the scene were taken to a hospital after some complained of nausea and vomiting, said police Lt. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>. The symptoms of the fumigant are diarrhea and vomiting, which was found inside the car, said police Sgt. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Burney </PERSON>. The victims appeared to be in their 20s, he said. Three of the four had papers, although police had n't verified the documents Tuesday. One had a Mexican passport, one had documents from <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>, and a third had papers that had been stamped in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> but indicated he was from <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> said. A Border Patrol agent said the patrol is working through the Mexican consul to identify the men. The patrol is investigating whether smugglers put the men in the trailer and whether other illegal aliens broke the door open later, said <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> French </PERSON>, agent-in-charge for the patrol's <LOCATION> Corpus </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Christi </LOCATION> area. Tuesday's discovery was the latest in a series of deaths since 1980 after illegal aliens crossed into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. On July 2, 1987, 18 Mexican men suffocated inside a locked railroad boxcar. They had come across the border into the <LOCATION> Missouri-Pacific </LOCATION> freight yard at <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paso </LOCATION>. A smuggler had locked the men inside the insulated box car that later was parked for hours in the desert sun at <LOCATION> Sierra </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Blanca </LOCATION>, about 90 miles east of <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paso </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Plans For Massive Airport Announced In Bid To Build Confidence</HEAD>
<HEAD>By DAN BIERS</HEAD>
<HEAD>Associated Press Writer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HONG KONG (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The governor today announced plans for a new airport and port complex costing $ 16 billion that is designed to boost confidence in the British colony before <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> takes over in 1997. The two-runway airport, to be built on an offshore island and landfill, and a new high-speed rail system and six-lane highway linking it to urban areas will be the territory's largest construction project ever. `` By pressing ahead with such ambitious programs despite the special pressures which our community has so recently faced, the government is demonstrating its commitment to <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>'s future,'' Governor Sir <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> said in his annual speech on the state of the colony. The announcement comes as the government tries to restore confidence in the territory, which was severely shaken by the harsh crackdown on dissent in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> in June. Many residents are concerned about what will happen when the territory is handed to Communist <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> in 1997, even though <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> has promised <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> can maintain its capitalist system for 50 years and enjoy a `` high degree of autonomy.'' In addressing those concerns, <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> said a draft <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> of Rights that would allow people to seek redress in courts if they believe their civil or political rights are violated would be ready by July 1990. But he did not discuss the increased political tension of recent days between <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> that has exacerbated the confidence crisis. <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> was angered by the colony's decision last month to allow a <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> swimmer who had sought political asylum to fly to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. It retaliated by refusing for the first time to accept the return of Chinese caught entering <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> illegally. The move has sparked fears in the colony of a flood of illegal immigrants. <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> devoted much of his speech to the massive construction projects that promise to change the face of this territory of 5.7 million people. `` Physically, <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> will have changed almost beyond recongition,'' he said. The centerpiece of the program is a new airport at <LOCATION> Chek </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lap </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kok </LOCATION>, about 15 miles west of downtown <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, which will replace the colony's existing airport, famed for a harrowing flight path that forces approaching aircraft to seemingly skim rooftops of the crowded <LOCATION> Kowloon </LOCATION> peninsula. The new airport, which should open by early 1997, will operate 24 hours a day and be able to handle 80 million passengers a year. That is more than three times the maximum capacity of the existing facility. A town for at least 150,000 people as well as industrial and commercial facilities will be built near the new airport. <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> also will construct `` what amounts to a completely new port on the western side of the territory,'' not far from the airport, <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> said. A large breakwater between two offshore islands will be built to increase sheltered anchorage and a new shipping channel will be dredged. The price of the projects is expected to be about $ 16.28 billion, <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> said. Although he did not provide specifics on financing, the government has more than $ 8.97 billion in surplus. <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> also mentioned an aggressive land reclamation policy that will expand the downtown area about 990 feet into the colony's famed harbor In addition, the site of the existing airport will be redeveloped. The governor failed to break new ground on political issues such as bringing democratic change to <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> and giving a segment of the population the right to emigrate to <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. Political commentator <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Y.S </PERSON>. <PERSON> Cheng </PERSON> said the speech will have a `` fairly neutral effect'' on the confidence of <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> people in the future. `` He has done what he can. What he said has already been anticipated. `` <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> people probably realize that their future is not determined by these well-written highly diplomatic policy speeches by the governor, but by the political situation in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>,'' he said. The speech had little impact on the <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> stock exchange, widely viewed as a barometer of public sentiment. Stocks fell slightly in the afternoon. <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Niem </PERSON>, research director at the stock brokerage <ORGANIZATION> Hoare </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Govett </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Asia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>, said the plan for a new airport had generally been expected since 1983. `` This wo n't necessarily influence foreign investors. I do n't think it is the key issue The key issue is still <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>,'' he said.

In a partisan primary delayed two weeks by Hurricane Hugo's devastation, <LOCATION> Charlotte </LOCATION>'s ballot Tuesday drew only 14,920 voters, or 7.5 percent of those eligible to cast ballots, according to Elections Supervisor <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Culp </PERSON> `` We had predicted 8 percent, so it was as bad as we expected,'' <PERSON> Culp </PERSON> said. `` I guess hurricanes and <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> are all this town can take.''

In complete but unofficial returns, six blacks, including five incumbents, were elected from six predominantly black voting districts. In the three remaining districts, which are mostly white, one white incumbent retained his seat, and two other districts will hold runoffs in which both opponents are white. The district plan has been criticized by whites, who complain their strength is still too diluted and that there should be another district where they are in the majority.

 The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> has joined the investigation into the vandalism, cross-burning and threats against a family of Ukrainian Christians. The bureau is looking into possible civil rights violations against <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ekaterina </PERSON> <PERSON> Doroshkevich </PERSON> and their eight children, who resettled in the area two months ago. A cross was found burning on the family's lawn Sunday morning and anti-Russian slogans were spray-painted on the <ORGANIZATION> Calvary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> God </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> that is sponsoring their resettlement. The pastor, the Rev. <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, received a telephoned death threat directed against his family and the Doroshkeviches. Lt. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Moeller </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lake </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said police are analyzing evidence and, so far, the incidents appear to be the work of a single person. `` It's far too early to theorize, but there's nothing at all to suggest this is anything more than an isolated incident from an individual, a misguided individual,'' he said. `` There's nothing to suggest a group or an organized activity.'' The harassment that <PERSON> Doroshkeviches </PERSON> have suffered is the first aimed at any of the more than 10,000 Soviet Christians who have immigrated to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> since 1988, said <PERSON> Judi </PERSON> <PERSON> Jankowski </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> chapter of World Relief, an arm of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Evangelicals </ORGANIZATION>. On Tuesday, the church received scores of phone calls after news reports of the harassment and vandalism. Almost all of the callers voiced support for the church and the emigres, said church secretary <PERSON> Donna </PERSON> <PERSON> Boyum </PERSON>. She said three callers criticized the resettlement of the Doroshkeviches, who say they suffered religious persecution in their Soviet homeland and spent 12 years trying to emigrate. More than 60 callers had a positive message, she said. `` We've had offers of donations, food and clothing, people who want to write notes of support to the family, other churches putting them on their prayer chain,'' <PERSON> Boyum </PERSON> said. `` People generally are shocked that anyone would do something like this.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Twin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Area </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION> planned to hold a session today allowing representatives of various religious organizations to speak out against the incidents. `` We fear this is an example of the xenophobia that seems to be occurring in our country, in which some people are threatened by any kind of difference whatsoever,'' said <PERSON> Carol </PERSON> <PERSON> Wirtschafter </PERSON>, assistant director of the <ORGANIZATION> Jewish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Anti-Defamation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Minnesota </ORGANIZATION> and the <LOCATION> Dakotas </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 Homesickness has prompted the return of more than 50 East Germans who fled their strict Communist homeland for the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> in the past month, a border official says. Nearly 50,000 East Germans have arrived in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> since Sept. 11, when <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> removed restrictions on crossing its western border. Many refugees cried tears of joy when they arrived, but West German officials have cautioned that many would face personal problems as they tried to fit into a new society. <PERSON> Wolfgang </PERSON> <PERSON> Schlee </PERSON>, spokesman for Bavarian border police, said Tuesday that 54 refugees who arrived since Sept. 11 already had returned and he expected more to do so. `` Homesickness is the key,'' he said by telephone from <LOCATION> Munich </LOCATION>. `` Many of them miss their friends. It's for personal reasons. `` In some cases, it's a question of wives, children and parents left behind, alone or in need of care.'' He noted that many brought `` only the most necessary things with them. Most of what they owned was left behind.'' Speculation has arisen about how the refugees would be treated if they returned home, but <PERSON> Schlee </PERSON> said he doubted they would face the harshness of the past. <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> severely punishes what it calls `` flight from the republic.'' Armed guards, fences and the <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> Wall are designed to block escape. Over the years, thousands of East Germans have been sent to prison after being caught fleeing. Official news media in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> have given prominence to statements from those who left and returned after becoming disillusioned in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. They regulary carry bleak descriptions of life in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, insisting that unemployment and housing shortages are rampant.

<TEXT>
 Voters cast ballots today to choose local councils that could reform the city's much-maligned school system by giving parents a direct say in their children's education. `` The bad education system is really crippling the city,'' said <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>, executive director of Designs for Change, an education research and advisory group that helped shape the reform package. `` Whether you have kids in school or not, it's important.'' <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>'s school system, the nation's third largest with 410,000 students, has had low test scores and high dropout rates. In 1987, then-Education Secretary <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> called the system the nation's worst. Under a reform package passed last year by the <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>, elections are being held today at the city's 469 elementary schools and Thursday at the 71 public high schools to take much power out of administrators's hands and turn it over largely to parents. Among other things, the councils will have the authority to hire and fire principals, develop school-improvement plans and spend money. `` I think people understand the significance,'' <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> said. `` The best indicator of that is that we have 17,000 candidates, and therefore we will have contested selections for almost all positions on the councils.'' Each council will include six parents, two teachers and two community residents without schoolchildren. School staffs will elect the teacher members. The 11th member of each council will be the principal of the school or schools the council oversees. A 50 percent turnout among parents with children in schools was predicted by community activists and others who spent weeks trying to mobilize residents to participate. `` I'm just asking people to take a look at this very seriously because to go into it for anything other than helping the kids, it will not work,'' said <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Guyton-Smith </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T clerk seeking a community representative spot on the council at <ORGANIZATION> Farragut </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> on the city's southwest side. Despite fears that politicians and others would manipulate the elections to favor certain candidates, <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> said election judges were hired by the school board to make sure the elections are impartial. Project LEAP -LRB- Legal Elections in All Precincts -RRB-, a watchdog group that monitors regular municipal elections, also agreed to monitor the voting to watch for improprieties.

 Even though <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>'s mayor wo n't be getting all A's from his <ORGANIZATION> Oakland </ORGANIZATION> counterpart, hostilities were played down as the <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Francisco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Giants </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Oakland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Athletics </ORGANIZATION> prepare to meet in the World Series Still, <ORGANIZATION> Oakland </ORGANIZATION> Mayor <PERSON> Lionel </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> wanted to capitalize at a press conference Tuesday on <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Francisco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mayor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Art </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agnos </ORGANIZATION>' recent remark that there was n't anything in <LOCATION> Oakland </LOCATION> he wanted. `` He kind of took a potshot at us recently, but I'm willing to let bygones be bygones,'' said <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, beaming in a bright green A's jacket and cap. `` I read this morning that he said he was joking,'' <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> said, referring to <PERSON> Agnos </PERSON>' comments. `` Well, it was n't a good joke, but so what?'' He pointed out the <ORGANIZATION> Athletics </ORGANIZATION> have won the American League pennant two years in a row and won three championships in the time it's taken the <ORGANIZATION> Giants </ORGANIZATION> to just make it into the Series two times. `` I appreciate the <ORGANIZATION> Giants </ORGANIZATION> being in the World Series. I'm happy for them,'' said <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, who reportedly was furious when he first heard <PERSON> Agnos </PERSON>' disparaging statements about his neighbor on the east side of the <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bridge </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>'s peace-making statements were spoken in the spirit of the first inhabitants of <LOCATION> Oakland </LOCATION> _ the <ORGANIZATION> Ohlone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Indians </ORGANIZATION>, a hunting and gathering people said to have maintained such a peaceful attitude that they had no word for war. But the reality is that the World Series war is on, and so is the rivalry between <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Oakland </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> disclosed that he wrote a letter to <PERSON> Agnos </PERSON> about the anti-Oakland comments he made last week. <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> said <PERSON> Agnos </PERSON> called him about the letter, but he did n't return the calls. `` I was too upset, and I think I had a legitimate reason. I've never said anything to try and diminish <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>,'' said 74-year-old <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, an <LOCATION> Oakland </LOCATION> resident since age 3 Sensing his `` joke'' about not wanting anything in <LOCATION> Oakland </LOCATION> had gone too far, <PERSON> Agnos </PERSON> on Monday called <ORGANIZATION> Oakland </ORGANIZATION> a `` great city with a great team and a great mayor.'' Agnos even said there were a few things he `` would n't mind winning'' from <LOCATION> Oakland </LOCATION> if <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> wanted to bet on the World Series. `` Sure. I'll go high stakes or low stakes,'' <PERSON> Agnos </PERSON> said. `` If -LRB- <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> -RRB- wants to go high stakes, I'll bet him Candlestick Park against the <ORGANIZATION> Oakland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coliseum </ORGANIZATION>. If he wants to go low stakes, I'll bet him dinner at <LOCATION> Flint </LOCATION>'s Ribs. <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> said he hoped for a `` friendly wager'' with Agnos on the Series, which he predicted the A's will win in six games thanks to their superior pitching. He knows a little bit about the sport, having played pro ball for the <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eagles </ORGANIZATION>, a black team in the days of segregated baseball. Before the news conference, <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> quipped: `` I know what I'll bet him; maybe I'll have a plastic foot made he can put in his mouth. At his own news conference in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Agnos </PERSON> told reporters Tuesday that he's won every bet he's made since becoming mayor, including one on the Super Bowl: `` I want to keep the string going.''

 At least a few buttoned-down, tight-collared patrons of elite Madison Avenue haberdasher <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Stuart </PERSON> were aghast last month when they received, along with their statement, a _ how to describe it _ a flier. `` Come on down and shop around!'' the thing blared, and went on to offer, if you can imagine this, something called a `` skip-a-month'' payment option for _ and at this point you simply must suspend disbelief altogether _ people strapped by back-to-school expenses. <ORGANIZATION> Paul </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stuart </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Julie </PERSON> <PERSON> Oddy </PERSON> says the flier was printed on `` cheap stock,'' with large block letters, and there were exclamation points in the text. Even the color was wrong: `` It was green and white, the color of money,'' complained Ms. <PERSON> Oddy </PERSON>. `` The whole thing was inappropriate considering who our customers are and what our image is.'' The flier's inclusion in the August statement -LRB- that is, the bill -RRB- came to <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Stuart </PERSON>'s attention when a customer told a member of the <PERSON> Grodd </PERSON> family, which owns the store, the easy credit flier seemed out of character. Three or four other customers also telephoned in their complaints. The fault rested not with <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Stuart </PERSON>, but with the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Credit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which provides billing, mailing and marketing services to <PERSON> Stuart </PERSON> and many other stores, including <ORGANIZATION> Caldor </ORGANIZATION>'s and Zayre's. <ORGANIZATION> GE </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Credit </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Orden </PERSON> said the flier was designed for other client stores in an attempt to boost September sales by allowing shoppers to skip a minimum payment in September. Customers would, however, be charged interest on their unpaid balance. The flier was stuffed in with <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Stuart </PERSON> bills without the store's knowledge. When <PERSON> Stuart </PERSON> found out, it fired off a letter to patrons apologizing for what it termed the `` rather crass flier.'' The letter blamed the flier's inclusion on a mistake by its mailing house, and assured patrons: `` We would never consider addressing you in such a manner.'' GE Credit admits the mistake, but says the `` skip-a-month'' plan is popular with some shoppers. Executives at <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Stuart </PERSON> `` just do n't want to bother their high clientele with those kinds of marketing tools,'' Ms. <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Orden </PERSON> said. In an interview several years ago, <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> Grodd </PERSON>, daughter of <PERSON> Stuart </PERSON> owner <PERSON> Clifford </PERSON> <PERSON> Grodd </PERSON>, described that clientele as `` a cross section of people who have achieved in all areas, most of the top people in every field.'' And punctual billpayers, too. Although <PERSON> Stuart </PERSON> stood by its inadvertent skip-a-month offer, Ms. <PERSON> Oddy </PERSON> says no one took advantage of it.

But representatives of a pro-Armenian group _ <LOCATION> Nagorno </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Karabakh </LOCATION> is a predominantly Armenian enclave in the republic of <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION> and the focus of a bloody ethnic dispute _ said the crowd was non-violent. <PERSON> Ashot </PERSON> <PERSON> Manucharyan </PERSON>, an Armenian legislator from the region, said in a telephone interview from the headquarters of the <ORGANIZATION> Karabakh </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION>, the capital of neighboring <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>, that the civilians were attracted to the bridge by warning shots fired into the air by the cadets. He claimed one civilian was killed in addition to the eight wounded. The <ORGANIZATION> Karabakh </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> has led the campaign for the annexation of <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION> to Armenian jurisdiction. Azerbaijanis are predominantly Moslem and most Armenians are Christians. It was not clear if the firefighters also were soldiers, but troops have been stationed in <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION> to try to keep the peace for the past year. On Tuesday, leaders of a grass-roots Azerbaijani movement suspended a rail strike that choked off supplies of fuel, food and housing supplies to <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>, a member said. `` We decided in a directive to open the railroad to <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> as of -LRB- 10 p.m. -RRB-,'' <PERSON> Ingilap </PERSON> <PERSON> Aslanov </PERSON>, a member of the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> and of the group's strike committee, said by telephone from the Azerbaijani capital <LOCATION> Baku </LOCATION>. He said the strike was suspended until Oct. 23 to give Soviet legislators in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> a chance to respond to <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION>'s demands to remove special Kremlin administration of <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION>. Soviet troops moved into the neighboring republics last week to break the blockade that has been strangling <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION>. About 400 trains with 60,000 cars were reported idled. Most supply routes must pass through <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION> to reach <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>. Official news media said Tuesday that in the previous 24 hours authorities managed to push 1,748 carloads of supplies through to <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>. But Deputy Premier <PERSON> Lev </PERSON> <PERSON> Voronin </PERSON> told the Supreme Soviet legislature that did not include oil products. A fuel shortage has stranded ambulances and halted harvesting in <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>'s fields. Reports said freight arriving in <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> under military guard was damaged. <PERSON> Aslanov </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Azerbaijan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> wanted the issue of <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION> taken up by the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet, the country's highest-ranking executive body, but settled for demanding that the Supreme Soviet legislature review the question. If it does not do so by Oct. 23, the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> will call a general strike that once again will include the railroads, he said. The People's Front says the rail strike started Sept. 4, but Armenian officials say the flow of goods by rail through <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION> dried up almost three months ago. President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, opening the fall session of the Supreme Soviet on Sept. 25, called for firm steps to break the transportation deadlock. After hearing Tuesday from <PERSON> Voronin </PERSON>, the Supreme Soviet once again called on <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION> to end their dispute.

 The leaders of the coup attempt against <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> had no intention of killing him during the several hours they held him hostage, a participant told the <ORGANIZATION> Miami </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION> The rebel, one of 42 Panamanians flown into <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> this week after seeking refuge at <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military bases in their homeland, spoke on condition that neither his name nor the location where he was interviewed be disclosed, the newspaper said today. He said his troops knew him as Commander Thunder. He suggested junior officers who took part in the coup attempt turned <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> over to their superiors. He said the rebels had held <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> hostage for several hours last week and could have killed him at any time. `` There was no intention at any time to kill the man,'' the coup participant said. Asked why, he said it may have been because a soldier would find it hard to execute his top commander. `` It may have been their military discipline,'' he said. In their public proclamations, the rebels said they had staged the coup to `` retire'' <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> and five senior colonels of the Panamanian <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION>.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Vaslav </PERSON> <PERSON> Nijinsky </PERSON>'s `` The Rite of Spring,'' the revolutionary ballet that provoked a riot at its <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> premiere 76 years ago, is showing the jaded world of the 1980s that it can still shock an audience. When the <ORGANIZATION> Joffrey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ballet </ORGANIZATION> presented its revival of the long-lost <LOCATION> Nijinsky </LOCATION> masterpiece, set to <PERSON> Igor </PERSON> <PERSON> Stravinsky </PERSON>'s jarringly primitive score, about 50 spectators stalked silently out of the <ORGANIZATION> Kennedy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Opera </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> during Friday's opening-night performance. Choreographed by the legendary <LOCATION> Nijinsky </LOCATION>, widely regarded as the greatest dancer of the 20th century, the ballet received a far more tumultuous reception at its Theater des Champs-Elysees debut in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> on May 29, 1913. The audience erupted in catcalls, whistles and bawling animal sounds when the dancers of the Ballets Russes de <ORGANIZATION> Monte </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carlo </ORGANIZATION>, standing hunched and pigeon-toed, began stomping obsessively to <PERSON> Stravinsky </PERSON>'s frenzied rhythms as they carried out the ancient Slavic ritual of a maiden's sacrifice for the renewal of spring. Fistfights broke out, dowagers shrieked and impresario <PERSON> Serge </PERSON> <PERSON> Diaghilev </PERSON> was pelted with fruit when he stood in the balcony to plead for order. The uproar drowned out conductor <PERSON> Pierre </PERSON> <PERSON> Monteux </PERSON>'s musicians, and <LOCATION> Nijinsky </LOCATION> stood on a chair in the wings furiously shouting cues to the dancers `` The theater seemed to be shaken by an earthquake,'' wrote an artist who sat in the audience that night. <LOCATION> Nijinsky </LOCATION>'s triumph was, indeed, an earthquake that shattered classical ballet traditions and marked the violent birth of modern dance. The Joffrey's recreation of the original `` <LOCATION> Le </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sacre </LOCATION> du Printemps'' -LRB- `` The Rite of Spring'' -RRB-, which was abandoned after only eight performances in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> in 1913, had its world premiere in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> two years ago. It is the highlight of a `` Diaghilev evening'' at the <ORGANIZATION> Kennedy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, running through Sunday, which also includes <LOCATION> Nijinsky </LOCATION>'s `` The Afternoon of a Faun'' with music by <PERSON> Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Debussy </PERSON>, and `` The Wedding,'' choreographed by <LOCATION> Nijinsky </LOCATION>'s sister, <LOCATION> Bronislava </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Nijinska </LOCATION>, to music by <PERSON> Stravinsky </PERSON> `` It was a ballet program to end all ballet programs,'' wrote <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Kriegsman </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>. Long a dream of the company's late founder, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Joffrey </PERSON>, the reconstruction and staging of the original `` Sacre'' was the result of seven years of painstaking detective work by <PERSON> Millicent </PERSON> <PERSON> Hodson </PERSON>, an American dance historian and choreographer, and <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Archer </PERSON>, a British art historian. After working with <LOCATION> Nijinsky </LOCATION>'s former assistant, <PERSON> Marie </PERSON> <PERSON> Rambert </PERSON>, in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> in the mid-1950s, <PERSON> Joffrey </PERSON> met Ms. <PERSON> Hodson </PERSON>, a graduate student at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Berkeley </LOCATION>, in 1971 and encouraged her to pursue her research on <LOCATION> Nijinsky </LOCATION> and the Ballets Russes. Starting in 1979 with only three black-and-white photographs of dancers from the original `` Sacre'' production, Ms. <PERSON> Hodson </PERSON> embarked on a search for scraps of materials to reconstruct the ballet in a sketch book. `` My dream was that it be performed on stage,'' she said. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, she met <PERSON> Archer </PERSON>, who was gathering material for a biography of <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Roerich </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Russian </LOCATION> archeologist and painter who designed the sets and costumes for `` Sacre'' and wrote the scenario with <PERSON> Stravinsky </PERSON>. Together, <PERSON> Archer </PERSON> and Ms. <PERSON> Hodson </PERSON> traveled to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Scandinavia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, conducting interviews and collecting memoirs, costumes, sketches and handwritten notes from the original production. Their professional collaboration led to marriage in 1982. They found an oboist who had played in the orchestra pit on opening night in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, and sketches left by an artist who drawn ballet scenes in crayon from her seat in the darkened theater. They interviewed the ballet physician's daughter, then a 13-year-old girl who sat in the audience and vividly recalled the astonishing scene more than 70 years later. In 1984, they happened upon what Ms. <PERSON> Hodson </PERSON> called `` absolute gold ... the single most important document of those seven years of research.'' It was a copy of <PERSON> Stravinsky </PERSON>'s rehearsal score containing Miss <PERSON> Rambert </PERSON>'s meticulously detailed notes on the dancers' movements throughout the 34-minute ballet. <PERSON> Archer </PERSON> tracked down most of <PERSON> Roerich </PERSON>'s original `` Sacre'' costumes, which had been auctioned in 1969 and were scattered among museums and private collections from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> to <ORGANIZATION> Castle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Howard </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> to the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Austin </LOCATION>. `` This was a phenomenon of dance that had been lost and never repeated,'' Ms. <PERSON> Hodson </PERSON> said. `` It was a complex kind of choreography, a branch that had n't grown. I wanted to see it brought back to life onstage so it could continue to grow.''

<HEAD>United States Changes Policy on Driftnet Fishing</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government changed course today and said it would back <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> islanders' call for a ban on driftnet fishing in their waters and on the high seas. `` There is a signal change in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy,'' <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Reese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> told delegates to the <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> in this <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> territory. On Tuesday, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> delegation, headed by <PERSON> Reese </PERSON>, held off endorsing a resolution to ban what one delegate called `` this barbarous form of fishing which should be banned everywhere.'' <PERSON> Reese </PERSON>, a deputy assistant administrator for the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION>, said he needed to consult with the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> for what direction to take on the resolution. South Pacific nations, the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> territories in the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION>, including <LOCATION> Guam </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Samoa </LOCATION>, have opposed driftnet fishing by <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>. Driftnetting has been called the `` wall of death'' because nylon nets up to 30 miles long and 49 feet deep are used to catch tuna. The nets trap everything, including seals, whales, sharks, dolphins, turtles and birds. On Tuesday, the Japanese consul general to <LOCATION> Guam </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Masao </PERSON> <PERSON> Wada </PERSON>, told the delegates that the driftnet issue should be addressed in a scientific, practical and friendly manner and not through a unilateral ban. He said <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> plans to reduce its number of fishing vessels and also will send an enforcement vessel to the region. The <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> is the governing body of the <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, which provides socioeconomic programs to underdeveloped, isolated <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> island countries and territories. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> contribute financially to the commission and take part on an equal basis with the smaller countries and territories at the conference. In making its policy shift, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> wanted the resolution applied to only the smaller <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> islands and to the American West Coast states. <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> was not mentioned. But the delegates agreed to include <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION> in the area covered by the resolution at the request of those two nations. <PERSON> Philippe </PERSON> <PERSON> Baude </PERSON>, permanent secretary to the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>'s delegate, questioned whether the resolution might violate international law. He said the commission has no legal jurisdiction over the waters in the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> islands affected by the resolution include <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Polynesia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Guam </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Samoa </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Cook </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Islands </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Federated </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> of <LOCATION> Micronesia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fiji </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Marshall </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Caledonia </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mariana </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Palau </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Papua </LOCATION> <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Guinea </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Solomon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tonga </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pitcairn </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Vanuatu </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Statutory Ban on Flag Burning Headed for Action in House</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A proposed ban against defacing the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> flag is headed for final action in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> this week, with Democrats seeking to do the job by statute and Republicans urging a constitutional amendment. Approval would send the proposed statutory ban to President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> for his signature, despite his statement last week that he regards anything short of a constitutional amendment as inadequate. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> postponed until Thursday a vote, originally scheduled for today, on the bill that would outlaw flag defacement by simple statute. It already approved the legislation, 380-38, on Sept. 12 but in slightly different form. Meanwhile, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> plans to take up the constitutional amendment backed by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and Republican leaders next Monday and the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> plans to consider that measure afterward. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> approved the bill on the statute, 91-9, last Thursday. Before doing so, it made a number of changes and the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> must pass upon them before the measure can go to the president's desk. As approved by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, the bill says, `` Whoever knowingly mutilates, defaces, physically defiles, burns, maintains on the floor or ground or tramples upon any flag of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> shall be fined under this title or imprisoned for not more than one year or both.'' The maximum fine would be $ 1,000. Federal law already calls for precisely those penalties for defacing the flag. Supporters of the change say, however, the current statute would likely be ruled unconstitutional by the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> called for an amendment after a <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruling in June that threw out a <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> flag-burning case on grounds that the state statute was an unconstitutional limit on freedom of speech. The wording of the federal statute is similar to the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> statute. Democratic sponsors designed the latest legislation to ban any act of flag defacement without considering whether it is part of a political protest. They hope that will shield it against any court challenge on free-speech grounds. They are trying to head off an amendment they say would limit freedoms guaranteed under the Bill of Rights in response to an isolated flag-burning incident. Republican supporters of a constitutional amendment, such as Sen. <PERSON> Orrin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hatch </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Utah </LOCATION>, contend no statutory ban on flag burning is likely to pass a court test, regardless of how carefully it is phrased. All but a few <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Republicans, however, voted for the statutory ban. Sen. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Metzenbaum </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ohio </LOCATION>, a critic of both the bill and the amendment, said some lawmakers probably voted out of fear that a `` no'' vote would come back to haunt them in campaigns. <PERSON> Metzenbaum </PERSON> and several other lawmakers have said, however, that the heat over the issue has subsided since it flared over the summer.

<HEAD>Coast Guard Gets SOS From Charter Boat; Hoax Suspected</HEAD>

 <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> crews searched the dark waters of the <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> early today after getting a distress call about a charter boat sinking with 18 aboard, but officials said the SOS may have been a hoax. `` I'm sinking, and I'm going into the water,'' a man claiming to be a charter boat captain told the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> late Tuesday, said Petty Officer <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Kephart </PERSON>. Seventeen life vests and a five-person raft were available on the 64-foot fishing boat, the man said, reportedly adding, `` We are going to abandon ship in 45 seconds.'' Boat and airplane crews found no sign of the vessel by daylight, and the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> received no reports of missing boaters, leading to speculation the call was a hoax _ especially considering the number of people supposedly on board, said Petty Officer 2nd Class <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Morehead </PERSON>. `` In a normal search and rescue operation like this, we get several calls from family members and friends and other cocnerned people. We have n't gotten that in this case,'' he said. `` There is the possibility that this is a hoax. But we are operating on the assumption that this is a legitimate call, until we are confident we have searched the whole area with no sign of a boat and no report of anyone overdue.'' The search was centered about 30 miles south of <LOCATION> Pensacola </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pass </LOCATION>, the entrace to <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Pensacola </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>. Seas were 3 to 4 feet, winds were 8 mph and the water was around 70 degrees, making overnight survival in the water possible, said Lt. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> McBride </PERSON> of Mobile, <LOCATION> Ala </LOCATION>.

 Recorded radar indicates the exact point where the engine of a DC-10 jetliner failed over <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> farmland in July, according to a <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transporation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> report. A map released by the board Tuesday shows the erratic, looping flight path of the jetliner over <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> farmland before it crash-landed at <LOCATION> Sioux </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> airport on July 19, killing 111 of the 295 people on board. Another passenger died 31 days later from injuries received in the crash. The winding flight path, which spirals tightly downward after a wide loop, documents the difficulty pilots had in getting the DC-10 jetliner to the airport after losing hydraulic steering control. Over one point on the map, small triangles indicate the spot where the airliner's tail-mounted engine disintegrated, said spokesman <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Lopatkiewicz </PERSON>. He said investigators believe the radar hits indicate falling engine parts. The map was released as a farmer harvesting corn near <LOCATION> Alta </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, found what investigators said may be a key missing engine part _ a rotor fan disk from a jet engine _ embedded in the ground. <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, the engine's manufacturer, had asked farmers to be alert for parts that turned up in their fields and offered cash rewards for their return. The pilots, who were using engine thrust to guide the plane, indicated they could only turn right through most of the landing, but the map shows they also managed a tight, 180-degree left turn towards the runway before a final 360-degree right loop, just before landing. The board released nearly 300 pages of material on the crash, including the radar data and reports on the efforts of flight attendants to secure passengers before the crash, air traffic control operations and the performance of systems on the crippled aircraft. The documents do not indicate the cause of the explosive engine failure that forced the plane's crew to make an emergency landing. But one investigative team concludes that `` forceful discharge of fan rotor parts severed or loosened hydraulic lines associated with all three hydraulic systems.'' A report on flight recorder data says there is no indication of a problem with the plane's tail engine before it failed. The safety board is not expected to come to a conclusion about the probable cause of the crash until several more months of investigation by its staff. Rewards have been offered for missing engine parts, including a large disk from the tail-mounted engine. The recorded radar data provided time, position and altitude of the airliner, which was on a flight from <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. At one point, radar lost the airliner, but digital flight data from the plane's flight data recorder confirmed a final loop just before the landing, according to the report. A report on survival factors said 76 people died of `` multiple blunt force impact injuries'' and 35 people died of smoke inhalation. The report said 30 children were aboard the airliner. Earlier, <ORGANIZATION> Iowa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Examiner </ORGANIZATION> Dr. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> said eight of the passengers who died were 11 years old or younger and all of those died of smoke inhalation.

 Tropical storm <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> battered <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> and southern <LOCATION> Luzon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> today with 62 mph winds, killing at least 18 people, injuring 55 and shutting down transport, schools and government offices. Up to 20 fishermen were reported missing after two fishing boats broke from their moorings and collided early today at a port in <LOCATION> Batangas </LOCATION> province south of the capital. Nearly 60,000 people fled their homes and sought shelter in government relief centers, officials said. Damage was extensive in <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>. About 95 percent of the city of more than 7 million people was without electricity as winds ripped down power lines. Schools in <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> were closed for the day, as were government offices and stock markets. <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> officials at <ORGANIZATION> Clark </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> north of <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> said <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> knocked out 80 percent of the electricity in the camp's housing area. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> was the second killer storm to strike the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> in the last week. On Friday, Typhoon <PERSON> Angela </PERSON> roared across the northern coast of <LOCATION> Luzon </LOCATION>, killing at least 118 people.

<TEXT>
 An estimated 30,000 people marched through this industrial city today to protest apartheid and honor 20 blacks killed by police during a 1985 funeral procession. The march, which stretched for more than three miles, was one of the largest in a series of protests nationwide since President F.W. <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON> announced last month that the government would allow peaceful mass demonstrations. Many of the marchers in <LOCATION> Uitenhage </LOCATION> wore black arm bands in commemoration of those who died in 1985, when police fired on several thousand mourners heading toward this city from the black township of <LOCATION> Langa </LOCATION> in a funeral procession for men killed earlier by police. Police were deployed in large numbers along the parade route and blocked off side streets with barbed wire, but no disturbances were reported. Nearly all the marchers were black, but some were white or mixed-race. Three clergymen heading the parade presented a petition to a police commander containing demands of the marchers, including improved services and schools in <LOCATION> Langa </LOCATION>, lifting of the state of emergency and release of political prisoners. Marchers help aloft banners of the outlawed <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> guerrilla movement and placards with slogans, including one which said: `` Do n't Shoot Us. We March For Peace.'' Uitenhage, a stronghold of the pro-apartheid <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, is in eastern <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Province </LOCATION> near the coastal city of <LOCATION> Port </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Elizabeth </LOCATION>. Police said today that 40 people were arrested for violence during a mass protest Tuesday in <LOCATION> Mpumalanga </LOCATION>, a black township in <ORGANIZATION> Natal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Province </ORGANIZATION>. An estimated 10,000 to 15,000 people attended a rally there demanding that national police units be withdrawn and be replaced by police from the tribal homeland of <ORGANIZATION> KwaZulu </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> Mpumalanga </LOCATION> has been one of townships hardest hit by violence arising from a three-year power struggle between supporters of militant anti-apartheid groups and members of <ORGANIZATION> Inkatha </ORGANIZATION>, a more conservative Zulu political organization.

<HEAD>California Politicians Propose Major Environmental Initiative</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Environmentalists and top state Democrats have unveiled a ballot proposal to phase out cancer-causing pesticides, ban new oil drilling offshore, set up a spill cleanup fund and protect <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s ancient redwoods. The sweeping Environmental Protection Initiative, proposed on Tuesday, would also create an elected statewide office of environmental advocate to enforce the law. The proposal was outlined by gubernatorial candidate Attorney General <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Kamp </PERSON>, other Democrats and several environmental groups. Sponsors have five months to gather the 372,178 signatures needed to put it on the 1990 ballot. Analysts give the measure a strong chance of passing. `` The point of the initiative is to end what we consider to be a decade of environmental neglect and begin a decade of environmental action through programs for preserving a clean ocean, clean food, clean atmosphere and a clean government,'' said <PERSON> Assemblyman </PERSON> <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Hayden </PERSON>. Advocates say it would protect food by phasing out cancer-causing pesticides by 1996 and requiring improved chemicals by 1997. The measure would protect the coast with tough standards for discharge of pollutants and require sewage plants to meet federal clean water standards by the year 2000. A $ 500 million fund for prevention and cleanup of oil spills would be established, and the initiative would allow drilling leases within the three-mile state limit only in a national energy emergency. It also would create a $ 300 million bond program for acquiring and protecting <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s ancient redwoods. The measure was drafted with help from such groups as the <ORGANIZATION> Sierra </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conservation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Voters </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Natural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>. `` By supporting this initiative, <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> voters will be making a personal commitment to the planet,'' said <PERSON> Lucy </PERSON> <PERSON> Blake </PERSON>, executive director of the conservation voters league. She said the measure would restore the state to `` its rightful place'' at the forefront of the environmental protection movement.

<TEXT>
 Just as the abortion battle intensifies in the courts and statehouses, some political observers and population experts say the issue is bound to become an irrelevant relic, overtaken by technology. They say the `` abortion pill'' in growing use in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> inevitably will reach <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, legally or illegally, and forever change the argument: women who want abortions will have them without having to visit clinics, possibly without doctors _ and maybe even without knowing whether they are pregnant. To anti-abortion forces, the French pill is a cloud on the horizon. It comes as the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> faces another opportunity to overturn its 1973 decision that legalized abortion and as <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> legislators meet in the nation's first special session on abortion since the high court in July gave states additional power to regulate abortions. `` People on either side of the argument are spending a lot of energy and emotion on a political issue that's going to be defused,'' says <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Cole </PERSON>, who teaches in the Science, <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Program </ORGANIZATION> at <ORGANIZATION> Rutgers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J </LOCATION>. He has looked into the likely political consequences of an easy-to-use, at-home abortion pill. <PERSON> Werner </PERSON> <PERSON> Fornos </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Population </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, says RU486, the French pill, `` will make the entire issue moot. It will take the judgmental community out of play.'' <PERSON> Fornos </PERSON> says if the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> overturns <PERSON> Roe </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Wade </PERSON> and turns the abortion question back to the states, that's likely to intensify the infiltration of RU486. `` This would become the newest of illegal substances that would readily find themselves in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> marketplace,'' he says. The anti-abortion community's leaders acknowledge that the French pill will divert their energies to new fronts _ to keep the drug from being smuggled into <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, from being approved by the <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> and from being manufactured by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> pharmaceutical houses. They already speak of boycotts of any drug house that seeks to conduct research on the abortion pill. `` Our position is very clear and I think the drug companies are very aware of it,'' says <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Glasow </PERSON>, education director of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Right </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> to </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Life </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, the largest anti-abortion group. `` Based on the evidence that we have before us, we do n't think it's going to come into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> either legally or illegally,'' says <PERSON> Glasow </PERSON>. `` It's against the law, it's dangerous for women to take and nobody is going to give it to women.'' He says medical liability laws will make doctors refuse to oversee its use. Cole, however, draws a comparison with the birth control pill. Efforts were made to enforce laws to prevent the sale and use of birth control devices until the birth control pill came into widespread use, he says, and at that moment the battle against contraception effectively ended. And he says a society that could not keep liquor out during Prohibition and can not keep tons of cocaine from crossing the border will not be able to prevent people from smuggling in a pill whose use is legal and considered safe and useful in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>. Anti-abortion leader <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Bauer </PERSON>, former domestic policy adviser to President <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, says keeping RU486 illegal is crucial to the anti-abortion movement, even though `` certainly if it is illegal there will be people who use it.'' The abortion-inducing RU486 was developed by <PERSON> Etienne-Emile </PERSON> <PERSON> Baulieu </PERSON>. One year after its introduction, he says it has been given to 25,000 women in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> with a success rate of 96 percent. In some instances, a second pill must be taken, and <PERSON> Baulieu </PERSON> says medical supervision is called for. Nonetheless, he said last week that the pill can `` give more privacy to the decision of pregnancy interruption.'' RU486 is a synthetic chemical that, when taken within the first seven weeks of pregnancy, induces an abortion by causing the uterus to shed the egg. Its French manufacturer, <PERSON> Roussel </PERSON> <PERSON> Uclaf </PERSON>, citing anti-abortion opposition and a threatened boycott, withdrew it from the French market on Oct. 26, 1988, but resumed distribution two days later under the direction of the French government, whose health minister called the drug `` the moral property of women.'' The French firm is not seeking to sell licenses to market the drug in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and no application for testing is before the <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>. But the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Women </ORGANIZATION> and the Fund for the Feminist Majority predicted last summer that RU486 `` will come within this country in the next two to five years,'' adding: `` The question is whether it will come legally, and therefore be administered safely under a doctor's supervision, or illegally, with increased risk for women.'' Says <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Barden </PERSON>, vice president of the <ORGANIZATION> Population </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, `` What the anti-abortion people are afraid of is that if it were on the market no one would ever know how many abortions there were. Often a woman would n't be aware that she was pregnant. She would miss a menstrual period and take a pill. And that's what takes the pill out of politics.''

 A former nursing home aide was sentenced to 20 to 40 years in prison today for helping smother elderly patients in a pact with her lesbian lover. `` Without you, I'm sure this matter never would have been cleared up,'' Circuit Judge <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Benson </PERSON> said in sentencing <PERSON> Catherine </PERSON> <PERSON> Wood </PERSON>, who had pleaded guilty and testified against her lover.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s chief of staff was urging the governors of seven states today to accept radioactive waste from the <ORGANIZATION> Rocky </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Flats </ORGANIZATION> nuclear weapons plant in order to avert a possible shutdown of the plant next year, officials said. The facility near <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> is the nation's only source of plutonium triggers used in nuclear warheads. Colorado Gov. <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Romer </PERSON> has said he will not allow the plant to continue operating if alternative sites are not found to store the waste by next March. Energy Secretary <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> has said closure of <ORGANIZATION> Rocky </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Flats </ORGANIZATION> would amount to unilateral nuclear disarmament, since the triggers can not be made elsewhere. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON>, the White House chief of staff, was telephoning the governors of <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> today to ask for their help and to underscore the importance of keeping Rocky Flats open, said <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Keif </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman. `` He'll tell them this is a critical thing, we hope you'll help,'' <PERSON> Keif </PERSON> said The seven states chosen as possible alternative sites for the Rocky Flats waste were selected because they already host <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> nuclear facilities, <PERSON> Keif </PERSON> said. Some of these states, including <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, already have said publicly they would not agree to take any Rocky Flats waste, even temporarily. The waste is contaminated with plutonium, which remains radioactive for 240,000 years. Also today, <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON>'s top aide on nuclear waste issues, <PERSON> Leo </PERSON> <PERSON> Duffy </PERSON>, was meeting with <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Carson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> to ask him to drop his already-announced opposition to holding some of the <ORGANIZATION> Rocky </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Flats </ORGANIZATION> waste, <PERSON> Keif </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Duffy </PERSON> later was flying to <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Falls </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, to make a similar plea to Gov. <PERSON> Cecil </PERSON> <PERSON> Andrus </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> had been storing excess waste from Rocky Flats, but on Sept. 1, <PERSON> Andrus </PERSON> sealed his state's borders to further shipments, citing the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s failure to open a planned permanent waste dump in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> on time. <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> last week that the Waste Isolation Pilot Project, or WIPP, near <LOCATION> Carlsbad </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.M. </LOCATION>, would not be ready to open before next July 1 at the earliest. <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> said about 250 cubic yards a month of Rocky Flats waste would have to be stored elsewhere after March in order to meet <PERSON> Romer </PERSON>'s demands while <ORGANIZATION> WIPP </ORGANIZATION> was unavailable. He suggested then that he would ask seven states to share the burden of temporarily holding the waste, while acknowledging that it would be difficult to persuade the governors. <PERSON> Duffy </PERSON> also planned to meet with <PERSON> Romer </PERSON> today in <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> to discuss the problem, <PERSON> Keif </PERSON> said. In addition, <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials were briefing the states' congressional delegations on the WIPP repository problems and the need for alternative storage sites.

<HEAD>Refugees Threaten Strikes Over U.N. Food Aid Cut</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ARANYAPRATHET, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Cambodians in <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>'s largest refugee camp threatened strikes and refused to unload <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> food supplies today after the international organization cut aid to the camp, a relief official said. Aid workers said Tuesday that the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> cut some of its food rations to the sprawling Site 2 camp because food and other supplies were being diverted to guerrillas fighting inside <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>. Site 2 is controlled by <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, one of the three guerrilla groups fighting the Vietnam-backed government in <LOCATION> Phnom </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Penh </LOCATION>. The cuts meant a decrease of about 20 percent of the total food aid to the camp, which houses about 140,000 Cambodians, they said. But the Cambodian administration of the camp had told refugees that the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> had cut off all aid to the camp, the relief official said today, speaking on condition of anonymity. Workers in the refugee administration had refused to unload <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> food trucks and hospital staff had threatened to strike on Thursday, he said. `` The -LRB- guerrilla group's -RRB- tactic appears to be to create anti-United Nation's sentimemnt among the population,'' he said. Some refugees had become hostile to relief workers, and some aid staff had been verbally abused, he said. Although there are more than 100 outside relief workers in Site 2, much of the essential day-to-day work is done by refugees. The aid official said the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> had insisted the refugees ensure that international food supplies are not sent to the guerrillas, or sold on the open market. It had also demanded an end to military operations carried out from Site 2, he said. Relief officials have reported diversions of food, medicine and other humanitarian aid since the international assistance program began a decade ago. Some officials privately have been especially critical of the aid being supplied to the communist <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> guerrillas, who exercise rigid control over the civilians under their control. Human rights organizations have cited numerous human rights abuses at the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> camps, where monitoring of international aid is far more difficult than in camps of the other two guerrilla groups.

 Police have arrested a 16-year-old on charges of planting two bombs that exploded at his high school on consecutive days. Anonymous tips led officers Tuesday night to the home of the boy, whose name was withheld, Detective <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said. Police searched his home but would not say what they found and gave no motive for the bombings. Detective <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Gunter </PERSON> said the youth had no arrest record and had not been in trouble at school. Bombs exploded Monday and Tuesday at 1,200-student <ORGANIZATION> Anderson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, causing no injuries. Classes were canceled and students sent home both days. Damage was estimated at less than $ 800. As word of each blast spread, telephoned bomb threats were phoned to several other high schools in the area of central <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, authorities said. Classes resumed without incident today. Principal <PERSON> Horace </PERSON> <PERSON> Chadbourne </PERSON> said attendance was normal. `` Everything's going well,'' said <PERSON> Shelley </PERSON> <PERSON> Drake </PERSON>, assistant vice principal. `` Students are happy and feel secure, and we're about the business of education.'' `` I'm sure it's over. This is a new day,'' she added. Ms. <PERSON> Drake </PERSON> said teachers came to school early and patrolled the halls before class. `` We did that just to let the students know that everything's fine,'' she said. Not all of the students felt safe, however. `` It's kind of scary,'' said <PERSON> Jackie </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohler </PERSON>, a sophomore. `` I feel safer, but one of my teachers told me this usually starts a chain, so we'll probably have some -LRB- bomb threats -RRB- today.'' The teen-ager was arrested at his home at 8:30 p.m. and charged with two counts of arson and two of manufacturing an explosive device, all felonies. He was held at a juvenile detention center. The student made no statement, <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said. At least one other youth was either involved or was aware of what was happening, investigators said. They are looking into the possibility of filing charges against him, they added. On Tuesday a small pipe bomb exploded about 7:35 a.m. in a hallway outside the school auditorium, said <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Petersen </PERSON>, agent in charge of the federal <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alcohol </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tobacco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Firearms </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Indianapolis </LOCATION>. Only a few students and teachers were in the building at the time. Earlier Tuesday, Chief <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Rheam </PERSON> said police would step up security at the school today. `` I do not fear for any teacher or student coming to the school tomorrow,'' he said. Monday's explosion occurred in a wrestling room below the west end of the the school's 9,000-seat gymnasium. The crudely made device was a small fire extinguisher filled with gasoline and a smokeless powder, police said. It was placed atop a heater 15 feet above the floor, <PERSON> Petersen </PERSON> said. `` The bombs were placed in areas where there is not heavy traffic flow, so that the person that's placing the bombs has some feeling that he does not want anyone hurt,'' <PERSON> Rheam </PERSON> said. Prosecutor <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawler </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> said he will ask the juvenile court to waive jurisdiction on the bombing suspect. This would move the state's case into adult courts and mean the suspect could face stiffer penalties.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> welcomed <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>'s President <PERSON> Francesco </PERSON> <PERSON> Cossiga </PERSON> to the White House today to discuss issues including changes in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and `` the need for unity ... when tensions are easing but the threat to peace and freedom still exists.'' <PERSON> Cossiga </PERSON>, in remarks at a ceremony on the South Lawn of the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, called for more Western aid to the reform government of <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and touched on other areas of sensitivity between <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Unied </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, including Italian aid to leftist <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. At the arrival ceremony, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> recalled that his first stop in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> as president last spring was in <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>. `` The road to alliance unity began in <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>,'' he said, referring to the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> conference that he attended on that trip. The president said he and <PERSON> Cossiga </PERSON> planned to discuss the reform movements sweeping Eastern European nations as well as developments in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and the Western alliance. `` We'll discuss alliance issues and the need for unity that is critical today when tensions are easing but the threat to peace and freedom still exists,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. In a lengthy statement, <PERSON> Cossiga </PERSON> noted `` changes in the direction of democracy which are taking place in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>.'' Calling for more financial assistance to help the process, he said, `` I'm thinking in particular of the great Polish nation that is currently in the throes of serious difficulty in its courageous attempt to work its renewal and which needs more substantial aid from us.'' <PERSON> Cossiga </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> wants to create `` a new relationship with <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, particularly the countries of the opposite shores of the Adriatic -LRB- Sea -RRB- and over the Alps.'' He also said that <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> will continue its assistance in <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, where the country's aid to the Sandinista government of <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> is a bone of contention with <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. The three-day official visit is <PERSON> Cossiga </PERSON>'s first since assuming office in 1985.

 Former President <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Ford </PERSON>, once roundly ridiculed for declaring `` there is no Soviet domination of <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>,'' says he is taking particular pleasure in liberalization moves there, especially in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. `` My mother taught me it is wrong to crow,'' <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> wrote in a column on the op-ed page of today's editions of The Washington Post. `` But former presidents as well as small boys know no greater joy than being able to say: ` I told you so!''' <PERSON> Ford </PERSON> recalled his statement during a 1976 presidential campaign debate with <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>, who went on to defeat him, that `` there is no Soviet domination of <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, and there never will be under a <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> administration.'' `` I blew it,'' <PERSON> Ford </PERSON> wrote. But, he added, `` Reading the verbatim record with 20-20 hindsight in the light of recent developments in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and throughout <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, I come out pretty well as a prophet.'' Thirteen years after he made the statement that angered many Americans of Eastern European descent, <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> said countries in the Soviet orbit `` are writing themselves new constitutions, based on fundamental human rights and freedoms.'' The former president noted that `` boasting, like lusting, is best limited to one's heart.'' So, he added, `` when my friends say, ` You know, what you said about <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> not being dominated by the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> was n't so stupid after all'' I give them a Sphinx-like smile and accept their -LRB- I guess -RRB- compliments.''

 Anti-apartheid activists met with President F.W. <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON> today to discuss the imminent release of eight political prisoners and ask him to make more concessions to the black majority. <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON> met with Anglican Archbishop <PERSON> Desmond </PERSON> <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON>, the Rev. <PERSON> Allan </PERSON> <PERSON> Boesak </PERSON> and the Rev. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Chikane </PERSON>. The talks were the first de Klerk has held with militant black leaders since he took power in August. <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON>'s announced Tuesday that the government would free eight longtime prisoners, including seven leaders of the outlawed <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. A prison official said the release would be within two weeks. Anti-apartheid activists welcomed the announcement but called the move insufficent unless the government also frees <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>, legalizes banned organizations, and lifts restrictions on many black leaders not in prison. `` What is the use of releasing them when we still have a state of emergency and when our organizations are still banned?'' the Rev. <PERSON> Allan </PERSON> <PERSON> Boesak </PERSON> asked 4,000 people at a rally at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> the Western Cape Tuesday night. `` Eight is not enough, with detainees and political prisoners, including <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>, still being held hostage,'' said <PERSON> Boesak </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION> of Reformed Churches. The government has indicated <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> may be released within the next few months. Also today, police used tear gas and batons to stop black youths from entering a sports stadium in the mixed-race township of <LOCATION> Athlone </LOCATION>, near <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION>, where about 3,000 had gathered to celebrate <PERSON> Mpetha </PERSON>'s expected release. Police forbade the crowd from marching out of the stadium, and the youths sang freedom songs before dispersing quietly when they were told <PERSON> Mpetha </PERSON> had not yet been freed. State radio acknowledged in an editorial today that the prisoners have a constituency among <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s black majority and need to be part of negotiations. `` Where <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Sisulu </PERSON> ... and others are recognized by some communities in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> as their authentic leaders _ and if they, too, subscribe to democratic and peaceful objectives _ there is a need for them to be placed in a position where they can make a contribution to the debate on just how a future <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> should look,'' Radio <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> said. <PERSON> Sisulu </PERSON> is the country's most respected black leader after <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>. <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>, told of the releases in advance, was with a group of anti-apartheid leaders at his home on the <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Verster </PERSON> prison farm north of <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION> when state television made the announcement. `` Mr. <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> said he would greatly enjoy his sleep tonight after all his efforts to secure their release,'' said <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> <PERSON> Morobe </PERSON>, a spokesman for the banned <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> anti-apartheid alliance. He quoted the 71-year-old <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> as saying to South Africans: `` The people are going to be greatly endowed by the leadership who are coming out of jail.'' `` This unexpected turn of events will take the townships by storm and thousands will welcome them home,'' the Sowetan, the nation's largest black daily newspaper, said today. In <LOCATION> Blackpool </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> welcomed the announcement of the releases, calling it `` a major step in the right direction.'' <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON> said the men would be freed `` as soon as the necessary formalities'' are handled. A prison official said privately the process can take from an hour to two weeks. <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON> took office in August and, unlike his predecessors, appears to be in earnest when he says he wants to allow eventual power-sharing with the black majority. <PERSON> Sisulu </PERSON> ran daily operations of the <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> as its secretary-general in 1949-54, when the government ordered him to resign. He was sentenced to life in June 1964, along with <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> and other leaders of the <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION>'s internal military wing, for sabotage and plotting the overthrow of the goverment. <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>'s other co-defendants to be freed are <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON> <PERSON> Kathrada </PERSON>, 60; <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Mlangeni </PERSON>, 63; <PERSON> Elias </PERSON> <PERSON> Motsoaledi </PERSON>, 65; and <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Mhlaba </PERSON>, 69. <PERSON> Wilton </PERSON> <PERSON> Mkwayi </PERSON>, 66, who took command of the <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> military wing, Spear of the Nation, after <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>'s co-defendants were arrested in July 1963, is to be released from a life term he received after a separate trial in 1964. <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON>'s announcement also named <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> <PERSON> Mpetha </PERSON>, an 80-year-old, partially blind diabetic with one leg who has spent most of his five-year prison term in the hospital and was due for release next year. <PERSON> Mpetha </PERSON>, the country's oldest political prisoner, was the <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> leader in <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> province and, during the appeal of his terrorism sentence in 1983, was elected a co-president of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>. The eighth man, <PERSON> Jafta </PERSON> <PERSON> Masemula </PERSON>, was a member of the outlawed <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Africanist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> guerrilla organization sentenced to life in 1963 for sabotage.

 A Syrian pilot landed his Soviet-made MiG-23 fighter jet in northern <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> today and the Israeli army said he was a defector. <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> denied the pilot defected and said he was forced to land because of a mechanical problem. `` This morning a <LOCATION> Syrian </LOCATION> pilot escaped from <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> with his plane, a MiG-23, and he landed safely in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>,'' said Lt. Col. <PERSON> Raanan </PERSON> <PERSON> Gissin </PERSON>, an army spokesman. The pilot landed at noon at an airfield at <LOCATION> Megiddo </LOCATION>, 57 miles north of <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, and was met by Defense Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> and the army's chief of staff, Lt. Gen. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Shomron </PERSON>, an army communique said. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio said the man was being questioned. In Damscus, a <LOCATION> Syrian </LOCATION> official said: `` The plane faced a technical failure and the pilot was compelled to make an emergency landing.'' He spoke on condition of anonymity. The official denied the pilot defected and said the government has begun contacts with the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> to secure the return of the aircraft and the pilot. Another Syrian source, also speaking on condition of anonymity, said smoke was pouring out of the aircraft's only engine. `` It was so bad that immediate landing was a must. The pilot had no alternative but to land in the nearest spot he could find.'' Israeli witnesses to the landing said the plane did not appear to be in trouble when it touched down. Military sources said aircraft was escorted by Israeli planes before it landed and that bases in the north were put on alert. It would be the first defection by a Syrian pilot to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. The neighboring countries have been in a state of war since <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s founding in 1948 The army identified the pilot as <PERSON> Adel </PERSON> <PERSON> Basem </PERSON>, 34, and said he flew the aircraft across the frontier in the Israeli-annexed <LOCATION> Golan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Heights </LOCATION>, which <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> captured from <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> in the 1967 Middle East War. A witness told a reporter that the aircraft buzzed a row of houses moments before touching down at an emergency strip near an air base. `` I was so surprised that I followed in my car to see what it was,'' said a resident of the area who gave his name only as <PERSON> Moshe </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio said the plane carried no weapons. The radio said the aircraft was an updated MiG-23 with very advanced electronics. The MiG-23 was believed last updated in 1985. <PERSON> Gissin </PERSON> said there were two previous landings by <LOCATION> Syrian </LOCATION> airmen in 1973, both due to navigational error. The men were later exchanged for Israeli prisoners of war but their two MiG-17s were not returned. The MiG-23 single-seat, swing-wing fighter bomber is considered one of the top Soviet jets in use. The aircraft has a range of 530 miles and can carry up to 17,000 pounds in bombs and missiles. Arab pilots have defected to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> twice in the past. An Iraqi pilot, <PERSON> Munir </PERSON> <PERSON> Redfa </PERSON>, landed in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> in a MiG-21 on Aug. 16, 1966, in a mission blamed by <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> on the <ORGANIZATION> Mossad </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s secret intelligence agency The operation also angered the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, which was later allowed to examine the aircraft. The first <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> defector was an Egyptian, <PERSON> Hilme </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahmoud </PERSON> <PERSON> Abbas </PERSON>, who flew a Soviet-built training plane into the country Jan. 19, 1964. Military officials promptly hailed today's landing as a boon to the country's knowledge of enemy Arab war capabilities. `` I think in one sentence we can say that this is an important event for the air force, without a doubt,'' said reservist Maj. Gen. <PERSON> Mordechai </PERSON> <PERSON> Hod </PERSON>, a former air force commander. `` The significance is that the air force can now examine the plane secretly and test its electronics,'' <PERSON> Hod </PERSON> added in a radio interview. Other commanders noted that the MiG-23 had been used by <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> during <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s 1982 invasion of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> and that it was a mainstay of <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>'s air force, regarded as one of the greatest military threats to the Jewish state. The Syrians have since acquired a more sophisticated aircraft, the MiG-29, which is the most advanced Soviet-made fighter. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio said the MiG-23 was first supplied to <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> after the 1973 Middle East War, the fiercest confrontation between <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> today called in two key senators to mend fences in the aftermath of the failed coup in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, while administration officials tried to glean information from rebel leaders given refuge in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> summoned Sen. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Boren </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Okla </LOCATION>., the chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, and Sen. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Maine </LOCATION>, the vice chairman, following a week of congressional criticism about the way the administration handled the abortive uprising The president `` has the highest respect for the judgment and integrity'' of the two `` and wanted to take this occasion to reaffirm the close working relationship with Sens. <PERSON> Boren </PERSON> and <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> and the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Select </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION>,'' a White House statement said. Also present at the 35-minute meeting, where <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> thanked <PERSON> Boren </PERSON> for his bipartisan leaderhsip on foreign policy, were chief of staff <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON>, national security adviser <PERSON> Brent </PERSON> <PERSON> Scowcroft </PERSON> and Scowcroft's deputy, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gates </PERSON>. Scowcroft and <PERSON> Boren </PERSON> had clashed during televised interviews Sunday, with the senator saying his committee had given <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> everything he sought regarding <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, and Scowcroft disputing that statement. Backing away from Scowcroft's stand, a senior administration official said today that <PERSON> Boren </PERSON> and <PERSON> Scowcroft </PERSON> talked about the matter after the interviews and agreed they on the same track. `` General <PERSON> Scowcroft </PERSON> had no disagreement with Senator <PERSON> Boren </PERSON>'s statement,'' said the official, who declined to be identified The official said <PERSON> Boren </PERSON> and <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> have been cooperative with the administration on <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, and today's meeting was intended to cement the relationship and `` repair any damage.'' Meanwhile, <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials have been debriefing some of the members of the <ORGANIZATION> Panamanian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> who had tried to topple Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> on Oct. 3. Among the 42 Panamanians the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> flew to <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> on Saturday was Capt. <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Licona </PERSON>, believed to be the highest-ranking participant in the coup to escape capture, said one administration official who spoke on condition of anonymity. Family members of slain coup leader Maj. <PERSON> Moises </PERSON> <PERSON> Giroldi </PERSON> also were in the group, <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Rich </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanders </PERSON> said Tuesday. He would not confirm whether the group included <PERSON> Giroldi </PERSON>'s widow, <PERSON> Adela </PERSON> <PERSON> Bonilla </PERSON> <PERSON> Giroldi </PERSON>, a key intermediary between <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials and the coup plotters `` These people definitely have good reason to be out of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Sanders </PERSON> said. `` <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s proven willingness to use force against people, murder people, is a matter of record.'' <PERSON> Giroldi </PERSON> was shot in the aftermath of the coup, by some accounts at <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s own hand In the wake of strong congressional criticism of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s reaction to the coup attempt, <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> complained Tuesday that interference by members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> undermined the administration's ability to handle the crisis. Also, an administration official said that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, unhappy over second-guessing about the way the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> handled the coup attempt, ordered top officials last Friday to put a halt to internal criticism. `` A lot of it -LRB- internal criticism -RRB- was coming from people who did n't have the full picture,'' said the official, who declined to be identified. <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> representatives have been debriefing the coup participants who were given sanctuary in this country, officials said. Officials in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> gave few details about plans for the <ORGANIZATION> Panama </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> members who were housed temporarily in a <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> hotel. `` They are coup members and their families,'' White House Press Secretary <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said Tuesday, adding that revealing their identities could endanger them. The group was received by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Franken </PERSON>, assistant director of refugee services for the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, said his organization assured the Panamanians their whereabouts would not be disclosed. It is expected that arrangements will be made for those who want to settle in this country, officials said. The Immigration and <ORGANIZATION> Naturalization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> was ready to review applications for political asylum from the group `` if such requests are made,'' according to <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON>. In an interview with The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> complained that during the coup attempt, `` We had situations here where members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> were literally calling -LRB- executive branch -RRB- agencies downtown, or even people in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, as these events unfolded, demanding information. That creates all kinds of problems.'' <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> also said some members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> made public comments based on inaccurate information, such as the assertion that <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> was offered to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials. However, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said, `` We do n't have any specific complaints'' about congressional interference in foreign affairs, particularly in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. The Pentagon said there had been dissension among the coup leaders about how to handle <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> when he was in custody of the coup participants on Oct. 3. Pentagon spokesman <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said an unnamed officer taking part in the coup insisted that <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> should be given to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and argued with <PERSON> Giroldi </PERSON> who `` had no intention, ever'' of taking that course.

 Cheek-to-cheek dancing has been declared out of step in the dance halls of <LOCATION> Shenzhen </LOCATION>, one of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s most open cities, and elsewhere in the country. The Shenzhen Daily, in a report seen in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> on Wednesday, said close dancing, using sexual enticements to attract customers, and disturbing social order are violations of local entertainment regulations. It said three dance halls were recently closed down and fined about $ 540 each for using lewd means to solicit customers. The daily said the closures were part of a citywide inspection and reorganization of <LOCATION> Shenzhen </LOCATION>'s 90 dance halls and teahouses. The popular dance spots play a positive role in providing a fulfilling cultural life for the masses and contributing to the city's investment environment, the daily said. But some, it said, are troubled by poor management and others have been influenced by `` bourgeois liberalization,'' the trend of favoring Western liberal thought that is being attacked by the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s conservative leadership. The dancing apparently is being banned elsewhere in the country, but it is particularly being enforced in <LOCATION> Shenzhen </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Shenzhen </LOCATION>, a special economic zone located near the capitalist enclave of <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, is regarded as one of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s most Westernized cities, and has apparently come under special attention in the government's campaign against bourgeois liberals. The president of <ORGANIZATION> Shenzhen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> was dismissed for failing to oppose the pro-democracy student demonstrations in the spring. It was not clear how long the ban on cheek-to-cheek dancing had been in effect in <LOCATION> Shenzhen </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s strict arbiters of public morals generally frown on close dancing and other public displays of affection. Regulations recently seen outside a dance hall in <LOCATION> Canton </LOCATION>, another freewheeling city near <LOCATION> Shenzhen </LOCATION>, warned against `` unhealthy dance styles'' such as partners nestling close to one another.

 Two <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> businessmen today pleaded guilty to diverting $ 1.2 million worth of government-surplus cheese to make frozen pizzas for commercial sale in supermarkets, the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said. <PERSON> Ricky </PERSON> <PERSON> Kazuo </PERSON> <PERSON> Oshiro </PERSON> and his brother, <PERSON> Cliff </PERSON> <PERSON> Oshiro </PERSON>, pleaded guilty in federal court in <LOCATION> Lexington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>, to a 1985-86 conspiracy to defraud an <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> program that donates surplus cheese to feed low-income people.

<HEAD>Ferre Sticks to His Style</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANIELA PETROFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Fashion Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MILAN, Italy (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 International fame has not changed <PERSON> Monsieur </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferre </PERSON>, as the Milanese creator is called since he became designated designer for the famed French house of Dior. He still cuts a modest, bashful figure with his rotund body and bearded, chubby face as he comes out on the runway for the standing ovation that greets his collection. He seems embarrassed by the lipstick marks left by his models who vie to kiss him on the runway, and inevitably takes out a handkerchief to wipe away his tears of emotion at another successful show. Yet this shy man always produces a dynamite collection. His style is sexy, self-confident and unmistakable. The Ferre silhouette puts the accent on the upper body with broad shoulders and ornate neckline, tapering into a small waist and narrow hips. He favors see-through fabrics, tight contours and bold hemlines. <PERSON> Ferre </PERSON>'s spring-summer 1990 collection, presented Tuesday night midway through the weeklong Italian ready-to-wear showings, was no exception. It was his first own label show since shocking the fashion world by accepting Dior's offer, and the crowd was curious to see if he could successfully divide his loyalties between traditional rivals <LOCATION> Milan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>. What they found was a Ferre better than ever, light and airy on the one hand, seductively masculine on the other. Thus, bare midriff chiffon see-through blouses are worn under slick man-tailored suits with large rhinestone and gold buttons. Or a huge silk corsage of flowers and feathers and bejeweled cufflinks turns a man-tailored shirt into a feminine item. Pants are cut straight for day and night, and they are a dandy's delight, coupled with an oversized white blouse with a spill of panels down the front resembling a huge bouquet of napkins and a straw fedora As the day goes on, <PERSON> Ferre </PERSON>'s style becomes more elaborate, culminating in a series of chiffon floral and paisley printed gowns richly decorated with gold and crystal sequins. <PERSON> Ferre </PERSON> is into heavy gold jewelry, as are many of the designers in <LOCATION> Milan </LOCATION>. He adorns his models with enormous charm bracelets with sea-motif charms, large beaded necklaces and chain belts. Among Ferre innovations were the short-skirted summer wicker work suits woven out of burlap to look like raffia, and a body suit in bands of gray jersey and skin colored chiffon that looked like mummy wrappings. Another big name to show Tuesday night was <ORGANIZATION> Mariuccia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mandelli </ORGANIZATION>, the master mind behind the <ORGANIZATION> Krizia </ORGANIZATION> label. The <ORGANIZATION> Krizia </ORGANIZATION> collection was young and carefree with an accent on the 1940s. To the tune of `` In the Mood,'' <ORGANIZATION> Krizia </ORGANIZATION> showed that by day she was in the mood for bright colors, short easy shapes and lots of prim navy blue and white. Neat daytime navy blue suits and dresses with crisp white lapels, alternated with T-shirts adorned with the new <ORGANIZATION> Krizia </ORGANIZATION> animal, the giraffe. These were worn over cheerleader shorts in tropical shades. Two new daytime ideas were jodhpur sweat pants, and patchwork camouflage leather. At night, <ORGANIZATION> Krizia </ORGANIZATION> indulges in her favorite fabric _ accordian pleated silk _ for beautiful shawled blouses and wafty pastel-colored short party dresses. Like many of her colleagues this week, <ORGANIZATION> Krizia </ORGANIZATION> has no trouble baring the flesh, leaving wide open spaces in the midriff or down the back. Bras as lingerie seem to be out of fashion, whereas they take on new life as outer wear, appearing in leather and jersey by day, and sequin and gold by night. See-through fabrics abound. For more than an hour, <ORGANIZATION> Krizia </ORGANIZATION>'s models kept coming out down the long runway. While reporters simply put down their notebooks, rowdier photographers shouted `` Basta!'' _ `` Enough!''

 Autopsies indicated four suspected illegal aliens found dead inside a flatcar trailer were killed by a pesticide used to fumigate its cargo of tortilla flour, an official said today. Railroad workers found the men Tuesday morning in the open trailer. It had been plastered with warning signs on its doors indicating its cargo had been fumigated with Phostoxin, which is used to keep insects and rodents away from food. <LOCATION> Travis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Coroner Dr. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Bayardo </PERSON> reported signs of internal bleeding typical of pesticide poisoning, said Justice of the Peace <PERSON> Sylvia </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON>. `` He said one of the guys had some coins in his pocket and those coins were black, indicating there was poison in there,'' Ms. <PERSON> White </PERSON> said. She said a full toxicology report would be completed later this week. The flour producer said Tuesday the victims had apparently broken into the trailer after it was fumigated, sealed and loaded on a flatbed car. The men, believed to be aliens from <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, had been sitting close to the ceiling of the trailer on boxes of flour piled four to five feet high and had cut a breathing hole the size of half-dollar in the ceiling, authorities said. The body of a fifth man was found near railroad tracks in <LOCATION> Sinton </LOCATION>, about 60 miles south of <LOCATION> Victoria </LOCATION>. `` We believe that he was a member of the party that was in this particular trailer. He may have either crawled out or fell out, but we do n't know positively,'' said <LOCATION> Victoria </LOCATION> police Capt. <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramirez </PERSON>. The captain speculated that the victims may have been asleep and that the fifth man woke up, felt ill and got out. Authorities also are trying to determine how the men got into the trailer, whether it was locked once they got in and how it was reopened. `` The doors can only be opened from the outside, so we're thinking somebody opened the door, saw them dead and ran off as quick as they could,'' <PERSON> Ramirez </PERSON> said He also said police talked to four illegal aliens Tuesday night who were on a different section of the train. During the stop at <LOCATION> Sinton </LOCATION>, the four got out of their compartment and walked around, discovering the four in the trailer and the fifth outside, he said. `` But they thought these guys were drunk. They tried to wake them, but could n't. So they got back in their own car,'' <PERSON> Ramirez </PERSON> said. One of the four aliens was later hospitalized in <LOCATION> Victoria </LOCATION> after complaining of nausea. The trailer, half-filled with corn flour called masa, had two warning stickers the size of license plates on its doors. They showed skulls and read in English and Spanish: `` Danger. This trailer is being fumigated,'' and `` Do not enter.'' <PERSON> Jorge </PERSON> <PERSON> Trevino </PERSON>, quality control manager for the flour producer, <ORGANIZATION> Azteca </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Milling </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Edinburg </LOCATION>, said he did not know when a contractor had treated and sealed the trailer, which is about 40 feet long, 8 feet tall and 10 feet wide. The victims inside the trailer had suffered diarrhea and vomiting, symptoms of the fumigant, police said. In addition, three rescue workers and seven police officers were taken to a hospital after some complained of nausea and vomiting, police said. <PERSON> Ramirez </PERSON> said one victim was from the state of <LOCATION> Guerrero </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. Another had documents from <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>, a third had papers that indicated he was from <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>, and the fourth man carried no identification, <PERSON> Ramirez </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> Border </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Patrol </ORGANIZATION> is investigating whether smugglers put the men in the trailer, said <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> French </PERSON>, agent in charge in the patrol's <LOCATION> Corpus </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Christi </LOCATION> area Tuesday's discovery was the latest in a series of deaths since 1980 involving illegal aliens who crossed into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. In 1987, 18 Mexicans suffocated inside a locked boxcar after coming across the border into a freight yard at <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paso </LOCATION>. A smuggler had locked the men inside the insulated car, which later was parked for hours in the desert sun.

<HEAD>House Panel Rejects Bill Calling for Quick Refunds</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Means </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> today rejected a bill that could have resulted in quick refunds averaging $ 223 apiece for customers of the nation's utility companies. The bill by Rep. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Matsui </PERSON>, D-Calif., lost on a 22-13 vote, with 12 Democrats and one Republican supporting it At issue in the bill, co-written by Rep. <PERSON> Byron </PERSON> <PERSON> Dorgan </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.D. </LOCATION>, was about $ 19 billion that the power, gas and telephone companies collected in advance from customers to pay corporate taxes to the federal government. The money was collected in anticipation that the utilities would owe taxes at a 46 percent corporate rate. However, when <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> enacted the 1986 tax overhaul, it cut the top corporate rate to 34 percent. <PERSON> Matsui </PERSON> was able to win passage at that time of an amendment giving utilities as long as 30 years to refund the excess to consumers. <PERSON> Matsui </PERSON> says now that he made a mistake, that he was misled by the utilities into believing that the excess would be used to buy new equipment. Many utilities, he says, are so rich with cash that they are buying such businesses as golf courses, recording studios and a drug store chain. `` Never before in my 11 years in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has an issue been as crystal clear as this one,'' <PERSON> Matsui </PERSON> said earlier this year when he introduced the heavily lobbied bill. `` It's a matter of right vs. wrong, good public policy vs. bad special interests, ethics vs. greed.'' His bill would have have given state utility commissions authority to order utilities to refund the excess over some period longer than three years. There was little debate in the committee before the bill was rejected. Reps. <PERSON> Ronnie </PERSON> <PERSON> Flippo </PERSON>, D-Ala., and <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Jenkins </PERSON>, D-Ga., argued that forcing quick refunds would cost consumers two or three times the size of the refund several years down the

<HEAD>Consumers Who Order by Phone Get New Purchase Protection</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> voted unanimously Wednesday to give consumers who purchase items by telephone the same rights they would have had if they bought through the mail. Currently, mail order merchandisers must notify consumers if they are unable to ship products and goods within the time stated in advertisments and catalogs. If the delay is going to be 30 days or less the buyer has the option to cancel the order. If the delay is going to be more than 30 days the order is automatically canceled unless the consumer expressly agrees to the longer delay. The <ORGANIZATION> FTC </ORGANIZATION> action Wednesday extends the rule to the shipment of merchandise ordered by telephone. `` The existing rule has been very popular,'' said Commissioner <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Azcuenaga </PERSON>, noting that just one of 34 preliminary comments received by the commission opposed the extension. That was from the representative of `` unnamed direct marketers'' she said. The proposed rule change would not apply `` to shipments ordered through use of other, as yet undeveloped technology, but would include all ordering methods involving direct or indirect use of the telephone,'' said <PERSON> Azcuenaga </PERSON>. This would include fax machines and machines produced for the hearing impaired, she said. The commission will send a notice of the proposed rule to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and publish notice in the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Register </ORGANIZATION>, allowing 30 days further comment before the rule can take effect, said spokeswoman <PERSON> Brenda </PERSON> <PERSON> Mack </PERSON>.

 About 2,000 police drove demonstrators away from a jail with clubs and water cannons early Wednesday and at least 28 people were reported injured. The protesters demanded the release of a dissident publisher. Police and opposition leaders said the casualties included 14 officers and 14 members of the opposition <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Progressive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. A policeman and four other people were reported hospitalized with serious injuries. Protest leaders said they believed many demonstrators did not report their injuries, and estimated total casualties at about 50. It was one of the most violent encounters in <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> since demonstrations were legalized two years ago. Demonstrations outside the Tucheng jail in a <LOCATION> Taipei </LOCATION> suburb began Tuesday, <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>'s National Day, when 10,000 people gathered to demand the immediate release of publisher <PERSON> Hsu </PERSON> <PERSON> Hsin-liang </PERSON>, 48. <PERSON> Chang </PERSON> <PERSON> Chun-hung </PERSON>, leader of the opposition party, said of Wednesday's violence: `` The police mercilessly launched the bloody attack on the peaceful crowd under instruction of the ruling <ORGANIZATION> Nationalist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. The demonstration would have ended peacefully if the police did not disperse us with force.'' On a videotape shown at <PERSON> Chang </PERSON>'s news conference, police were seen firing water cannons and swinging clubs at protesters, some of whom shouted `` Peace! Peace!'' <PERSON> Chang </PERSON> said police also smashed a van. Earlier Wednesday, police arrested 15 protesters who allegedly attacked them, then released all the detainees on bail. Among them was <PERSON> Hsu </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Lin </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheng-chien </PERSON>, who police said was hospitalized with serious bone fractures. <ORGANIZATION> Nationalist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Chu </PERSON> said the opposition should be held responsible for Wednesday's violence because several protesters threw stones and attacked police. `` They apparently ignored the laws and barely understand that most people want a peaceful society,'' he said. Protesters wearing yellow headbands and carrying yellow flowers rallied outside the jail Tuesday and said they would sleep there until they were allowed to meet with <PERSON> Hsu </PERSON>. About 3,000 protesters remained past midnight and the two-hour battle began when police moved in at 3 a.m. Police contended the demonstration was illegal because protest leaders did not apply for permission. They said the protesters were dispersed to avoid violence and restore the free movement of traffic. <PERSON> Hsu </PERSON> was jailed after his return last month from 10 years in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. He made the last stage of trip on a fishing boat from mainland <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. The government accuses him of helping organize an anti-government demonstration in 1979 <LOCATION> Kaohsiung </LOCATION> port. Protest leaders said the 1979 protest was aimed only at demanding more political freedom. The Nationalists fled the Chinese mainland when the communists won the civil war in 1949 and have governed <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> since.

 Music by such groups as the Smoky Mountain Boys along with demonstrations of such frontier arts as and lye soap-making are expected to draw thousands to the 10th Appalachian Museum Homecoming. Thursday through Sunday, the museum 16 miles north of <LOCATION> Knoxville </LOCATION> will play host to 480 crafts people, musicians, singers, authors and celebrities for the celebration of Appalachian pioneer life. `` So many of the older people look forward to this for literally months and weeks before the homecoming. They will talk about who they met for a long time afterwards,'' said museum founder and homecoming organizer <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Rice </PERSON> <PERSON> Irwin </PERSON>. For $ 6 a head, visitors can learn how to make lye soap, corn shuck dolls and flowers, hickory bark baskets, braided rugs, gourd items, knives, saws, skillets, glass, brooms and more. The demonstrations will be given by people who learned those skills as part of everyday life, <PERSON> Irwin </PERSON> said. `` It is just amazing how rapidly the culture has changed so that younger folks do n't have any idea what their grandparents did,'' <PERSON> Irwin </PERSON> said Tuesday. `` So many of the revivalists in the craft business are great people, but as you would surmise, it's just not the same as doing it like you have since childhood.'' The expected 35,000 visitors also can sample freshly made apple butter, sassafras tea, parched corn, molasses, bread, cream and butter. Music is a large part of the homecoming, including performers such as Grandpa <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>; Grammy-winning songwriter <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Driftwood </PERSON>, known for the hit `` Battle of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>''; songwriter, musician and river boat pilot <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Hartford </PERSON>, known for the hit `` Gentle on My Mind''; <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Acuff </PERSON>'s Smoky Mountain Boys; the Bottom of the Barrel Bunch and a band called Dismembered Tennesseans. The celebration also will feature appearances by regional and nationally recognized writers such as `` Roots'' author <PERSON> Alex </PERSON> <PERSON> Haley </PERSON>, who lives nearby. The pioneer museum in the hills of eastern <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> is a 60-acre collection of original pioneer buildings and paraphernalia. Its first homecoming consisted mostly of a few crafts people and some authors trying to sell books. But word of the annual festivity spread by mouth and the event grew in attendance. `` I do n't have a right to stop it,'' <PERSON> Irwin </PERSON> said. `` It would be like a preacher deciding to disband the church.''

 <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> engineers today reached into Atlantis' cramped engine compartment in an effort to replace a faulty computer the size of a TV set that delayed Thursday's shuttle launch by at least four days The delay came after a judge cleared the way for liftoff by rejecting environmentalists' fears that the shuttle's nuclear-powered Gallileo space probe could scatter plutonium over <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> in the event of a Challenger-like accident <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> said the liftoff of Atlantis and its Jupiter-bound <ORGANIZATION> Galileo </ORGANIZATION> could be rescheduled as early as Monday. The space agency <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> wants to launch Atlantis as soon as possible because <ORGANIZATION> Jupiter </ORGANIZATION> will be in the proper position only until Nov. 21; any delay beyond that would push the flight off until mid-1991. The space agency also has two other shuttle launches planned this year, and a long delay could affect that schedule. The decision to hold up the mission came after the master controller in one of three main engines gave a false pressure signal on a fuel pump, said launch director <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Sieck </PERSON>. Subsequent tests did not duplicate the bad reading. `` We have to ascertain that we completely understand the problem and that there is no chance it will reoccur in flight and put us in jeopardy,'' said <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Crippen </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> team that gives final launch clearance. `` The worst condition is that we would shut down an engine and have to abort the flight and we want to make sure there is no probability of that.'' Atlantis commander <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said he was disappointed by the postponement but agreed with the decision because `` safety is an overriding concern'' in spaceflight. Engineers today worked at disconnecting wires and tubing to reach the computer. <PERSON> Crippen </PERSON> said removal began Tuesday night. It required opening up the engine compartment to get at the computer, which is the size of a 17-inch portable television and controls all engine functions during liftoff. `` It's a crowded place to work,'' <PERSON> Crippen </PERSON> said. `` But we have done it before and we have the procedures in place.'' The countdown, which began Monday, was halted at the 19-hour mark. It will be picked up at that point when the computer work is done. The five astronauts flew back to <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> this morning to await resumption of the countdown. Shuttle workers received the bad news not long after getting the news from <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> Gasch </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> that they could proceed with launch preparations. The anti-nuclear groups had sought to block the liftoff on grounds that plutonium particles would spread over <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> if Atlantis exploded. The plutonium is in two nuclear-powered generators that provide electricity for the <ORGANIZATION> Galileo </ORGANIZATION>. `` The court concludes that <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> has complied with requirements of the National Environmental Protection Act,'' <PERSON> Gasch </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> attorneys representing the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> argued that <ORGANIZATION> Galileo </ORGANIZATION>'s $ 1.5 billion, six-year mission to <ORGANIZATION> Jupiter </ORGANIZATION> carried very low risks. They said the nuclear generators were well shielded and similar to 38 generators that have flown on 22 previous space missions. <PERSON> Gasch </PERSON>'s ruling came on a request for a temporary restraining order, a ruling that ca n't be appealed. The plaintiffs said they were going back to <PERSON> Gasch </PERSON> today to seek a temporary injunction, whose refusal can be appealed. The anti-nuclear groups said that if they lost in court they would attempt to halt the launch by trying to infiltrate the Kennedy Space Center and put people on the launch pad. `` On our side we're sad because the court did n't rule in our favor. But on the other side, we feel that we've succeeded in bringing the issue to the public, that they are planning to put nuclear power in space,'' said <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Gagnon </PERSON>, coordinator of the <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION>, one of the groups that sued. When the launch is attempted, he said, `` We're going to go with our plan to put people on the launch pad.'' Reaching the heavily guarded launch pad would be tough, said <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Wistrand </PERSON>, deputy director of security. `` We've installed various types of tactical intrusion devices,'' he said. `` Hopefully, if they try this tactic, we'll be able to detect and apprehend them before they are successful in getting to the pad.''

 <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s Communist ideology chief was quoted today as calling for a more democratic society, but the official party newspaper said the country can solve its problems only by strengthening socialism. The developments were the latest in a series of mixed signals the hard-line government has been sending the rest of the world as it grapples with a growing movement for social change. <PERSON> Kurt </PERSON> <PERSON> Hager </PERSON>, one of the most influential figures in the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> hierarchy, called for greater participation of the people in solving the country's problems, more openness in society and reform of the state-controlled press. <PERSON> Hager </PERSON>, a member of the policy-making party Politburo, made the comments in an interview with the Soviet weekly <ORGANIZATION> Moscow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> on Saturday, as street protests erupted in several cities during the visit of Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. State-run Radio DDR read the comments in a broadcast today. `` Our task in the immediate future is to come up with a clear concept for the development of necessary changes,'' <PERSON> Hager </PERSON> said. `` That will require, above all, the active involvement of the population in solving important problems and a new policy of public information.'' Referring to the exodus of mostly young people from the country, <PERSON> Hager </PERSON> said that `` all of the obstacles have to be cleared away that have apparently prevented our youth from developing their full potential.'' <PERSON> Hager </PERSON> also also called for the government to react to the `` needs and mood'' of the people. The party daily Neues Deutschland today conceded the country has problems, but at the same time said socialism must be strengthened to solve them. The newspaper also renewed its accusations against West German Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>, accusing him of `` unveiled interference in -LRB- <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s internal affairs.'' <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> has been extremely critical of the East German government in recent days. `` If today we stand before new demands that require new solutions, we'll manage that ourselves,'' the newspaper said. `` We can solve our own problems, not through <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>'s recipes, but through socialist means ... through the further strengthening of socialism. Every demand and recommendation that in reality aims at weakening or even doing away with socialism can not bear fruit among us,'' the newspaper wrote. Local Communist Party officials in at least three East German cities _ <LOCATION> Dresden </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Leipzig </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Magdeburg </LOCATION> _ have either started talks with pro-democracy activists or talks are planned, according to West German news media reports. But questions remain whether high-ranking leaders in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> are ready to move away from the strict adherence to Communism that has helped sparked an exodus to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> of tens of thousands of its skilled young citizens. <PERSON> Guenter </PERSON> <PERSON> Krusche </PERSON>, head of the church in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>, told West German radio today there are indications a number of East German cities will soon legalize the main opposition group, New Forum, according to West German radio. On Tuesday, West German news media reports said local Communist officials had met with opposition leaders in <LOCATION> Dresden </LOCATION> and talks were expected soon in <LOCATION> Leipzig </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Westdeutscher </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rundfunk </ORGANIZATION> radio in <LOCATION> Cologne </LOCATION> said today that <LOCATION> Magdeburg </LOCATION> party leaders `` have also said they are ready for a dialogue.'' However, <PERSON> Erich </PERSON> <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON>, the country's 77-year-old Communist leader, has indicated he will crush dissent if it challenges stability. Over the weekend, authorities used force to disperse demonstrators, clubbing and arresting hundreds. Then officials in <LOCATION> Leipzig </LOCATION> allowed a peaceful march by 70,000 people Monday night. Local Communist officials met Monday with opposition leaders in <LOCATION> Dresden </LOCATION> and talks were said to be expected in <LOCATION> Leipzig </LOCATION>, the first signs of official willingness to discuss change. <PERSON> Christof </PERSON> <PERSON> Ziemer </PERSON>, the superintendent of <LOCATION> Dresden </LOCATION>'s Lutheran church, said the two sides discussed electoral reform, ending travel restrictions and the release of people arrested during street demonstrations. The nationwide protests by tens of thousands of people were <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s most serious since Soviet tanks helped put down a workers' revolt in 1953. Pro-democracy activists said authorities freed at least 500 of the roughly 1,000 people arrested during demonstrations in <LOCATION> Dresden </LOCATION> over the past week. Widespread discontent is responsible for the exodus of tens of thousands of East Germans to the West and sparked the weekend demonstrations, which coincided with official celebrations of the country's 40th anniversary. <PERSON> Hans-Juergen </PERSON> <PERSON> Sievers </PERSON>, a Lutheran church pastor in <LOCATION> Leipzig </LOCATION>, said Tuesday in a West German radio interview that he believed the decision by the <LOCATION> Leipzig </LOCATION> officials to work for dialogue `` was certainly not made alone without discussions with others.'' East Germans do not choose their leaders and they need government permission to travel abroad. Many complain of tyrannical Communist officials who can make life miserable for people who challenge the system.

The Supreme Soviet broke out in debate. One deputy even had the gall to call a ban unconstitutional. In the old days, when the leader spoke, real debate did not follow _ not if those who would dissent cherished their place in the scheme of things. This time the deputies got together and proposed a compromise that was less than ... <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> wanted but which he could accept. Under the compromise, strikes will be forbidden selectively in certain key economic areas, and government agencies were given permission to take over the railroads in the restive republics of <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> to keep traffic moving. While this hardly constituted a crushing legislative defeat for Comrade No. 1, it suggested that the concept of separation of powers is no longer a totally foreign one in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. Furthermore, in the pre-Gorbachev days, Soviet leaders did n't bother to seek legislative approval to stop strikes The normal procedure was to repress them ruthlessly.

 Oct. 5 <ORGANIZATION> Centre </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, on airline deregulation: <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> lawmakers have long been concerned about declining airline competition, ... but their concerns were largely ignored by the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration. There are encouraging signs, however, that President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and a growing number of Republican lawmakers are finally noticing the evidence, particularly of monopoly control at major hub airports, and may support steps to increase competition. Airline deregulation was expected to encourage new airlines and more competition by getting rid of government red tape. Since the changes took effect in 1978, many new airlines were launched but most went out of businesss. At the same time, the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration failed to increase airport capacity and, more important, approved a string of large airline mergers. The results have been higher fares and fewer options for consumers. Department figures underscore the need for changes to break up ... near monopolies. In 1988, eight airlines accounted for 90 percent of domestic air traffic, compared with 15 carriers in 1984 and 11 in 1979. Republicans ... are weighing legislation that could force airlines to sell their computerized reservation systems, cap the percentage of gates an airline may control at an airport, and ban or restrict carriers' long-term leases at airports. In the long run, of course, increasing airport gates and expanding facilities -LRB- are -RRB- the best way to stimulate competition. But since that's not likely to happen immediately or on a large enough scale, the growing interest in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the administration in taking other steps is welcome.

 A farmer harvesting corn found the engine part believed to hold the key to a <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> jet crash that killed 112 people in July. `` It will fill in the answers, as far as what precipitated the engine failure,'' said <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON>, an investigator for <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, maker of the engine that disintegrated and severed the jumbo jet's hydraulic controls. <PERSON> Janice </PERSON> <PERSON> Sorenson </PERSON> said she was driving a combine Tuesday when she struck what turned out to be most of the engine rotor fan disk, a part so highly prized that <ORGANIZATION> GE </ORGANIZATION> had offered a $ 50,000 reward for it. Workers today loaded the metal onto an airplane bound for a GE plant in <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION> for inspection. <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> GE </ORGANIZATION> will comb the fields over the weekend for the rest of the disk and its connecting hardware. Only four of 20 bolts that held it to the engine have been found, he said. But <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> he said he was confident the large piece _ which represents about two-thirds of the 300-pound titanium disk _ would allow investigators to pinpoint the cause of the engine failure. `` I felt a resistance against the combine, so I backed up, and I looked and I could see the fan blades protruding from the ground,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Sorenson </PERSON> said today. Mrs. <PERSON> Sorenson </PERSON> said she knew immediately what the piece was because <ORGANIZATION> GE </ORGANIZATION> had distributed pictures of it to farmers. `` I was shocked and I was very happy for GE because they put a lot of time in it,'' she said. `` Hopefully it will solve some of the problems they've been looking for.'' <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> Flight 232 crashed July 19 about 50 miles away at <LOCATION> Sioux </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. A total of 184 people survived. Investigators have speculated that a separated fan disk caused the rear engine to disintegrate, throwing shrapnel that severed the hydraulics and made the plane virtually impossible to control. The crew managed to turn the jet around and reach <LOCATION> Sioux </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. `` There is no doubt about it, this is an extremely important find,'' <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Lopatkiewicz </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> said. `` Through meticulous metallurgy, we hope to determine if that was the point of failure in the fan section.'' <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> urged others to keep searching for other engine parts. `` A lot of important parts are still missing and are out there somewhere,'' he said. `` We're still looking for the other side of the separated piece.'' Of the $ 271,000 in reward money offered, more than half is still available, <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> said. In another development Tuesday, the <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION> released a radar map showing what it says is the exact point where the engine of the DC-10 failed during its flight over <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> farmland. The flight path spirals tightly downward after a wide loop. Over one point on the map, small triangles indicate where the tail engine disintegrated, said <PERSON> Lopatkiewicz </PERSON>. He said investigators believe the marks indicate falling parts. <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> said the disk originally was 31 inches in diameter. It was found about 10 miles north of here. Metal detection experts will be flown in this weekend to continue the search, he said. Several engine parts were found in farmers' fields on the day of the crash. Last week, as farmers harvested crops, several found pieces of the plane, including an engine fan blade in a bean field five miles from here. <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> said Mrs. <PERSON> Sorenson </PERSON> might receive more than $ 50,000 because some of the blades, for which the company is paying separate rewards, were still attached, said <ORGANIZATION> GE </ORGANIZATION> lawyer <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Gadd </PERSON>. Mrs. <PERSON> Sorenson </PERSON> said this morning she had n't had time to think about the reward. `` I guess that's kind of a minor part right now.''

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s investigation of the USS Iowa explosion was `` thorough, complete and expeditious'' and did not malign the character of two sailors who were focuses of the inquiry, the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>'s inspector general said in a report obtained today. `` All logical investigative leads were covered, including those that required examining the backgrounds of persons closest to the explosion,'' Inspector General <PERSON> June </PERSON> <PERSON> Gibbs </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said in a report to <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Garrett </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>. Ms. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said she has concluded that the -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Naval </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investigative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- investigation was `` thorough, complete and expeditious.'' She also said the NIS `` did not malign the character'' of two sailors who had been in the gun turret that exploded by looking into rumors of homosexuality and a possible criminal connection to the blast. The inspector general's report, dated Oct. 6, was undertaken in the wake of allegations that the <ORGANIZATION> NIS </ORGANIZATION> had mishandled the probe. It was made available to The Associated Press by <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> officials. Rear Adm. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Milligan </PERSON>, who conducted the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s four-month study of the explosion, said Gunners Mate <PERSON> Clayton </PERSON> <PERSON> Hartwig </PERSON> was the most likely person to have caused the explosion, and that he apparently placed some type of detonator between gun powder bags. <PERSON> Hartwig </PERSON> and 46 other sailors were killed in the April 19 explosion, which occurred in the No. 2 gun turret of the battleship as it conducted gunnery practice off <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Hartwig </PERSON>'s family has accused the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> of using the sailor as a scapegoat and sought a congressional investigation into the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s report Another sailor, Gunner's Mate <PERSON> Kendall </PERSON> <PERSON> Truitt </PERSON>, has charged the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> with slurring his reputation. Ms. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> noted that <PERSON> Milligan </PERSON> brought the <ORGANIZATION> NIS </ORGANIZATION> into the investigation 21 days after the blast occurred, when allegations of possible criminal acts surfaced. She said <PERSON> Truitt </PERSON> was investigated because of `` a possible motive for homicide'' that surfaced after <PERSON> Hartwig </PERSON>'s sister wrote a letter to the <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>'s commander complaining that her late brother had made <PERSON> Truitt </PERSON> the sole beneficiary of a life insurance policy. `` Several witnesses, including members of <PERSON> Hartwig </PERSON>'s family, raised the possibility of homosexuality on the part of <PERSON> Hartwig </PERSON> ... The NIS had no choice but to explore the issue as a potential motive in the incident. To neglect that investigative lead would have been derelict,'' Ms. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> wrote. `` The <ORGANIZATION> NIS </ORGANIZATION> report offered no opinion about the homosexuality issue,'' she said. While witness statements `` alluded to possible homosexuality, the <LOCATION> NIS </LOCATION> investigation did not confirm it and the report did not claim that either <PERSON> Hartwig </PERSON> or <PERSON> Truitt </PERSON> were-are homosexual. The NIS did not malign the character of <PERSON> Hartwig </PERSON> or <PERSON> Truitt </PERSON>.'' `` Homicide, suicide and human error were all obvious theories that had to be explored,'' Ms. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> added. `` The homicide theory was short-lived. <PERSON> Truitt </PERSON> was never a definitive homicide suspect ...'' Inspectors general in each federal department monitor their agency's performance and investigate allegations of wrongdoing.

 Americans avidly followed news of Hurricane Hugo but paid scant attention to another widely reported story, the personal troubles of Rep. <PERSON> Barney </PERSON> <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>, according to a survey released Wednesday. In its News Interest Index for October, <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mirror </ORGANIZATION> reported that 60 percent of the public followed the Hugo story very closely, placing it third on the list of the most closely followed stories of the past three years. Only the explosion of the space shuttle Challenger and the rescue of <PERSON> Jessica </PERSON> <PERSON> McClure </PERSON> from a well in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> have attracted greater public attention since the Times Mirror surveys began in 1986. Eighty percent of those polled said they followed news of the Challenger explosion, in January 1986, very closely. The story of the child rescue in October 1987 was followed very closely by 69 percent. By contrast with the attention paid to the hurricane coverage, only 6 percent said they closely followed stories about <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Democrat who has acknowledged patronizing a male prostitute and then hiring him as a personal assistant and driver. This puts the Frank story in a tie for the least closely followed story of those surveyed. The troubles of former Japanese Prime Minister <PERSON> Noboru </PERSON> <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>, who resigned in May because of an influence-peddling scandal, were also attended to closely by only 6 percent of Americans polled. `` The difference in public response to these two stories is in keeping with a pattern that has become clear from the monthly findings of the <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mirror </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Interest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Index </ORGANIZATION>,'' <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mirror </ORGANIZATION> said in a news release. `` Public attentiveness to coverage of news events is high, while public attentiveness to news about most personal scandals is usually low.'' <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mirror </ORGANIZATION> also said that its October findings `` dramatically reinforced'' previous indications that news from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, even when it has far-reaching consequences, often gets little attention. No major <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> story in the latest survey was followed closely by as many as 25 percent of Americans. Even interest in overseas events, such as the flight of East German refugees to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> at 31 percent and the failed coup attempt in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> at 29 percent, outdrew <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> stories. Only 19 percent paid close attention to attempts in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to repeal the new catastrophic illness insurance plan, although understandably this rose to 36 percent among persons over age 50. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s education summit with governors was followed by 15 percent and <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> approval of a cut in the capital gains tax by 14 percent. Only 12 percent of the sample in the survey could identify <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> without assistance and only 10 percent could identify <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>, former secretary of the scandal-plagued <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION>. By contrast, 80 percent knew that actress <PERSON> Zsa </PERSON> <PERSON> Zsa </PERSON> <PERSON> Gabor </PERSON> had been in the news because of her trial in <LOCATION> Beverly </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, on charges of slapping a policeman. <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mirror </ORGANIZATION> said the survey results were based on telephone interviews with 1,234 adults 18 or older, conducted from Oct. 5-8. It said the possible error attributable to sampling and other random effects was plus or minus 3 percent. The study was conducted by the <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mirror </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; the Press, a division of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mirror </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Company </ORGANIZATION>, which publishes the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> Times, <ORGANIZATION> Newsday </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Baltimore </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sun </ORGANIZATION>, the <LOCATION> Hartford </LOCATION> Courant and other newspapers and owns broadcast stations.

<HEAD>Beijing University Freshmen to be Taught to Shoot</HEAD>

 <ORGANIZATION> Beijing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> freshmen will be taught how to shoot and throw hand grenades during special year-long military training program that begins Thursday, an official newspaper said. Camp and field training, marching in formation, and basic military knowledge also are on the curriculum, the Guangming Daily said Wednesday. It did not give details of the weapons training or say whether the students would use live ammunition. <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> reported 143 other colleges and universities would conduct special eight-week military and political training courses, variously sending all or some of the students to military camps or inviting officers to campus. <ORGANIZATION> Beijing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, whose students helped lead the crushed pro-democracy movement in the spring, announced that its freshmen class would spend a full year in military training at the army academy in <LOCATION> Shijiazhuang </LOCATION>, 190 miles south of <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. University President <PERSON> Wu </PERSON> <PERSON> Shuqing </PERSON> said Saturday it was an experiment that had been planned well before the pro-democracy protests. He said experience had shown that military training was beneficial to students. Most colleges already require one month of military training for freshmen, but it is usually restricted to parade-ground drills and basic military theory. <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> quoted an unidentified official of the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> as saying the commission drew up a plan in 1987 to send students at 10 key univerities, including <ORGANIZATION> Beijing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, for a `` relatively long period of military training.'' `` The plan failed because it was beyond the capacity of the army,'' he said. But it was going ahead for <ORGANIZATION> Beijing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, he said, because `` the graduates of the prestigious <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> University should be fit for socialist construction -LRB- and -RRB- have a clear political orientation and sound morality.'' He said the program was not punishment for the students' role in the protests. He said military training was popular among students, parents and teachers `` because after the training the students become better disciplined, and come to have a better understanding of the practical conditions of the country.'' Many more colleges wish to send students for such training, he said. The Guangming Daily said the <ORGANIZATION> Beijing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> class would divide its time evenly among military, political and humanities classes. It said the school planned an opening ceremony for the students Thursday, and had been preparing for their arrival by shipping in textbooks and freshly painting the dormitories, cafeterias and desks. The students will wear the same uniform as the academy's 3,400 military cadets, <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> said. It described the school as <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s best training ground for junior officers, with `` up-to-date teaching facilities. <ORGANIZATION> Beijing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>'s freshman class numbers fewer than 800 this year, down from the 2,100 that had been planned before the protests and the June army crackdown. The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, which decides enrollment, also has cut the freshman classes of other universities nationwide, apparently in an effort to better maintain control over the student body. <PERSON> Wu </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Beijing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>'s student population had grown too large for its facilities, but said next year's freshman class probably would be closer to the size of previous years.

 A newfangled push-button device for guarding against germs on toilet seats has <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Brill </PERSON> flushed with excitement. <PERSON> Brill </PERSON>, a former advertising agent, is distributing the Swiss-made devices that include a special toilet seat attached to a spool of plastic wrap, which rolls out in place of conventional paper seat covers. `` People are paranoid about what you can contract from a toilet seat,'' said <PERSON> Brill </PERSON>, whose company has installed hundreds of the devices in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>. `` If you have a toilet seat covered with paper, the paper could absorb moisture that could go right to your skin.'' <PERSON> Brill </PERSON>'s customers include hotels, country clubs and restaurants. The device sells for $ 250 to $ 280 and can be leased for $ 15 to $ 19 a month. A case of 12 rolls of replacement plastic costs $ 48.95, with each spool providing 90 sittings worth. <PERSON> Brill </PERSON> said he picked up an interest in bathroom hygiene from his father, who considered toilet seats unsanitary. <PERSON> Brill </PERSON> first saw the Hygolet seat demonstrated in 1985. `` I thought it was the greatest thing since electricity,'' he said. `` You could freely sit on a toilet seat without worrying about who sat on it before you.''

<TEXT>
 Two black officials criticized an association for honoring the late L.B. <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>, the city's police commissioner during the civil rights turmoil in the 60s and a participant in a historic libel lawsuit. `` L.B. <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> was a famous racist and hater of black people and anything they stood for,'' said <LOCATION> Montgomery </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Commissioner <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Bray </PERSON> after the <ORGANIZATION> Alabama </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Officers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> announced that <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> would be installed Wednesday in its Hall of Fame. `` I think it was very inappropriate,'' said state Rep. <PERSON> Alvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON>. `` He promoted segregation and racism in the city.'' However, a third black official, <LOCATION> Montgomery </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> Councilman <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Dickerson </PERSON>, said he has no harsh feelings about the induction of <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>, who was <PERSON> Montgomery </PERSON>'s police commissioner from 1959-1967. `` The police commissioner's actions during the 1960s were a sign of the times,'' he said. `` He was playing a role. If he was the police commissioner today, he would be playing a completely different role.'' <PERSON> Murfee </PERSON> <PERSON> Gewin </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> Peace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Officers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, said the induction was based on <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>'s overall contribution to law enforcement. `` He was prominent in the field of advanced training of law enforcement officers and in increasing their abilities through continuing education,'' <PERSON> Gewin </PERSON> said. `` This is a career award.'' <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> sued <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> in 1960 after it ran an advertisement soliciting funds for the legal defense of the Rev. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Luther </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr </PERSON>. The ad said <PERSON> Montgomery </PERSON> police, armed with guns and tear gas, surrounded a <PERSON> black </PERSON> college after a student demonstration. <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> won the libel suit and a $ 500,000 judgment when the case was tried in <LOCATION> Montgomery </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>'s capital. But the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> eventually overturned the verdict on appeal, establishing libel precedent in the process. The court, ruling in what became known in libel case history as <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> vs. The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>, asserted that public officials who sue for libel must show that the story, even if false, was published with malice, with knowledge the story was false or with `` reckless disregard'' for whether it was true or false. The court's decision also established a higher standard of evidence to prove malice. <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>, who was state public safety director from 1951-1955, also served as state prison commissioner in the early 1970s when <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>'s overcrowded prisons came under federal court scrutiny. He was on then-Attorney General <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Baxley </PERSON>'s staff as executive assistant when he died in 1977 at age 56.

 <PERSON> Trygve </PERSON> <PERSON> Haavelmo </PERSON>, a Norwegian professor who dislikes awards for academics, won the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Science on Wednesday for using statistics and probability to forecast how economies behave. <PERSON> Haavelmo </PERSON> `` had a swift and pathbreaking influence'' on the new science of econometrics with his probability theory, the <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Swedish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION> said in announcing the award. `` I am honored. Anyone would be. But I had nothing to do with making this award. I really have nothing to say,'' said <PERSON> Haavelmo </PERSON>, 77, in an interview. The prize `` is quite irrelevant to the real issues. I'm exhausted and I have nothing more to say,'' he added <PERSON> Haavelmo </PERSON>, who still works part time at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oslo </ORGANIZATION>, has privately voiced disdain for academic prizes, colleagues said. Tore Thornstad, a co-worker at the university, described <PERSON> Haavelmo </PERSON> as a shy, reserved person who prefers research and teaching to being in the limelight. In his 1941 doctoral dissertation for <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Haavelmo </PERSON> pioneered the field of econometrics, which introduced statistical probability to economic testing and forecasting. The thesis was published in 1944. Ten years later he published a book of his research on economic development theory. The <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION> said in its citation that <PERSON> Haavelmo </PERSON> was awarded the $ 469,000 prize `` for his clarification of the probability theory foundations of econometrics and his analyses of simultaneous economic structures.'' <PERSON> Assar </PERSON> <PERSON> Lindbeck </PERSON>, head of the academy's prize committee and a personal friend of <LOCATION> Haavelmo </LOCATION>, called him `` the father of modern econometrics'' and a dominant figure in post-war economic theories. `` As soon as you take a serious report in your hand or a long-term projection, it is econometrics that charts the relationship between all quantitative economic analyses,'' <PERSON> Lindbeck </PERSON> told reporters. <PERSON> Haavelmo </PERSON> was the second Norwegian to win the economics prize since it was introduced in 1969 by the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sweden </ORGANIZATION> and added to the five other Nobel prizes. <PERSON> Ragnar </PERSON> <PERSON> Frisch </PERSON>, who once employed <PERSON> Haavelmo </PERSON> as a a research assistant, won the prize in its inaugural year. <PERSON> Haavelmo </PERSON> is a member of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION>. He was born Dec. 13, 1911 in the town of <LOCATION> Skedsmo </LOCATION> a few miles east of <LOCATION> Oslo </LOCATION>, the son of a school administrator. He graduated from the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oslo </ORGANIZATION> in 1933. He moved to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in 1939, at the outbreak of World War II, on a Rockefeller grant and worked at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> and later in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> with the Norwegian Trade Ministry. <PERSON> Haavelmo </PERSON>'s doctoral thesis won him immediate recognition. A think tank of young economic scientists from several nationalities, the <ORGANIZATION> Cowles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, was created to pursue the ideas he raised and other theories. <PERSON> Haavelmo </PERSON> returned to <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION> in 1947 and became professor of economics at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oslo </ORGANIZATION>. `` I see <PERSON> Haavelmo </PERSON> as an original thinker but one who always kept his theories relevant to the real world,'' said <PERSON> Thorvald </PERSON> <PERSON> Moe </PERSON>, a senior official of the Norwegian <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>. According to his sister-in-law, Mrs. <PERSON> Margit </PERSON> <PERSON> Haavelmo </PERSON>, he never married and his only brother died five years ago. `` He is a very well liked man,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Haavelmo </PERSON> said in a telephone interview. <PERSON> Roedseth </PERSON>, director of <ORGANIZATION> Oslo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Haavelmo </PERSON> usually comes in to work several times a week, although he went on full pension 10 years ago.

 Would you give a credit card to a teen-ager? <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Fingersh </PERSON> would. `` We felt that it would be to his advantage to learn about credit now in a small, controlled environment,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Fingersh </PERSON>, who helped her 13-year-old son, <PERSON> Adam </PERSON>, get a credit card from the <ORGANIZATION> Young </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Americans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>. `` He's very, very responsible and that's why we co-signed.'' More than 300 teen-agers have applied for credit cards since they were offered Aug. 3, said <PERSON> Leanne </PERSON> <PERSON> Cadman </PERSON>, a loan officer at the bank. Ten have been approved so far, but the bank noted that many applications are still being processed. The bank's premise is simple: Credit is a fact of life, and every youngster needs to learn how to use it responsibly. `` What we're trying to do is to teach them ... make sure what you're buying is worth it,'' <PERSON> Cadman </PERSON> said The card has a $ 100 limit, and is available to people who are at least 12 years old who have had a savings account with a minimum $ 10 balance for at least six months.

The non-profit organization has launched a drive to discourage credit cards for teen-agers. `` Our campaign is to discourage other banks from following suit around the country,'' he said. `` You can teach firearms without giving kids a loaded gun.

I think it was a really bad idea.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Fingersh </PERSON> said her son has friends whose parents have gotten into financial trouble with credit cards. She has seen teen-agers out on their own at 18 `` go like crazy'' when they obtain their first credit card. She does not want that to happen to <PERSON> Adam </PERSON>. Two other banks that cater to children have no plans to add a credit card to their services. `` That's a nightmare that I do n't want to get into,'' said <PERSON> Sherrie </PERSON> <PERSON> Avery </PERSON>, liaison between <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Miami </ORGANIZATION> and its <ORGANIZATION> Twiglet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> at <ORGANIZATION> David </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fairchild </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elementary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>House OKs Liberalized Abortion Restrictions</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> voted today to liberalize the restrictions it had placed on federally subsidized abortions for the poor since 1981. Lawmakers accepted a more permissive <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> provision by voice vote, thus setting up a confrontation with President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who has promised to veto legislation relaxing the conditions for Medicaid-financed abortions. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> provision would have Medicaid pay for abortions when the mother's life is in jeopardy or when the pregnancy resulted from rape or incest. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, on a 216-206 vote, first rejected its own restrictions that allow a Medicaid-financed abortion only when a woman's life is threatened by her pregnancy. The liberalized abortion language also prevailed on a second tally, by a vote of 212-207. The abortion provision was part of a $ 156.7 billion measure to finance labor, health and education programs for fiscal 1990, which began Oct. 1. In August, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> threatened to veto the entire spending bill if it contains the more liberal abortion language. Administration officials reiterated that threat this week.

<DATELINE>BLACKPOOL, England (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 On the fringes of this week's annual convention of Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, the race to succeed her has begun. In a party she has dominated for 14 years, and which prides itself on loyalty to the leader in good times and bad, the language is coded and the jockeying discreet. After 10 years as prime minister, Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> remains firmly in control of her party and intent on several more years in office. She is greeted with undimmed enthusiasm as she arrives daily in the convention center to sit attentively through hours of debates and speeches by her Cabinet ministers. By tradition, a prolonged standing ovation is guaranteed when she winds up the convention on Friday, her 64th birthday, with her keynote address. But Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s public opinion poll ratings are at an eight-year low, the pound is sliding, interest rates are soaring and headlines warn of economic crisis. Thus speculation about the succession is inevitable, and outside the Winter Gardens conference hall in this north <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> seaside resort, two of the top hopefuls, ex-Defense Secretary <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Heseltine </PERSON> and Deputy Prime Minister Sir <PERSON> Geoffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Howe </PERSON>, are playing to packed houses. <PERSON> Howe </PERSON> said Wednesday that Conservatives `` must show that we are good, not just at winning battles, but at winning arguments and winning friends. `` We must choose the style to match the mood of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> ... making sure that people recognize us as a listening party, just as much as a crusading one,'' <PERSON> Howe </PERSON> added at a crowded fringe meeting. Decoded, <PERSON> Howe </PERSON>'s statement was a clear criticism of Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s combative style, and the image she projects of lacking compassion toward the have-nots in the entrepreneurial <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> she has tried to create. <PERSON> Howe </PERSON>, 62, whose mild-mannered style is the antithesis of Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s, was removed as foreign secretary last summer in what was widely seen as a demotion. <PERSON> Heseltine </PERSON>, 56, a temperamental politician who stalked out of the <ORGANIZATION> Thatcher </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> in 1986 during a dispute over the takeover of an ailing helicopter-maker, <ORGANIZATION> Westland </ORGANIZATION>, topped two public opinion polls last week as the favorite to succeed Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>. <PERSON> Howe </PERSON> was also among the top six potential successors, along with former party chief <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> Tebbit </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Cecil </PERSON> <PERSON> Parkinson </PERSON>, and ex-Education Secretary <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, now party chairman. At a standing-room only fringe meeting in a Victorian theater, <PERSON> Heseltine </PERSON> hinted that the <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> government _ presiding over a record trade deficit _ was letting <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> slip back into the old ills of high-wage, low-productivity industry. `` Truth does not change simply because it is 10 years old,'' thundered the tall, self-made millionaire. `` <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> is not paying its way.'' <PERSON> Heseltine </PERSON>, a rank-and-file lawmaker, has been doing what all ambitious politicians do while waiting in the wings: going for the grass roots by campaigning tirelessly up and down the country. He never criticizes Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> herself, and when asked about his leadership aspirations, his stock response is that he'll do whatever the party asks. The leader of the <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> is chosen by its members of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, and if the party has a parliamentary majority, the leader automatically becomes prime minister. Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> has won three successive elections, and it is generally assumed she will lead the party into the next election, which must be held by mid-1992. But the <ORGANIZATION> Tories </ORGANIZATION> are trailing the opposition <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> by an average of seven points in a string of recent opinion polls. Labor has been consistently ahead for the past four months. Now, to take the shine of the Tory convention, interest rates are at 15 percent, double the rate of June 1988. Inflation, which Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> vowed to eradicate, is at 7.3 percent, and the pound has suddenly weakened. The downturn could be just a phase, as Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s supporters insist But if it is worse than that, and she looks like losing the next election, she might have to make way for a candidate with better prospects. Commented <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s liberal Guardian newspaper, `` If and when ... there actually is a vote for the leadership of the Conservative party to succeed Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>, it may be judged that the race began ... in <LOCATION> Blackpool </LOCATION>.''

 There are more than 20 million people of Hispanic origin in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, a nine-year increase of 5 -LCB- million, the <ORGANIZATION> Census </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> reported Wednesday. `` This is our first estimate of over 20 million,'' said <PERSON> Jorge </PERSON> <PERSON> Del </PERSON> <PERSON> Pinal </PERSON>, chief of the Ethnic and Hispanic Statistics Branch at the bureau. `` It's up from about 14.5 million in 1980.'' Hispanics constitute 8.2 percent of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> population and are the fastest growing large population group. The bureau said immigration was a major factor in the increase, accounting for about half of the growth. About two-thirds of the Hispanics in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> live in just three states. <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> leads with 34 percent, followed by <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> at 21 percent and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> with 10 percent. <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> has 8 percent of the nation's Hispanics, and there are significant populations in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>, the bureau reported. Estimates are not prepared for every state because `` Hispanics are not well spread out throughout the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' <ORGANIZATION> Del </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pinal </ORGANIZATION> said. The Census report estimated the total Hispanic population of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> at 20,076,000 as of March, up from 19,431,000 a year earlier. The largest segment is Mexicans at 12,567,000, followed by people of <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> origin, 2,545,000, Puerto Ricans, 2,328,000, and Cubans, 1,068,000. The balance were of Spanish or other Hispanic origin. Mexicans were mostly concentrated in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, the report said. Cubans are mostly in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, while Puerto Ricans tend to live in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, and Central and South Americans are largely in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. While Mexicans were the largest group they are not the fastest growing, the report said. Comparing the estimates for 1982 and 1989, the bureau said Central and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Americans </LOCATION> had increased by 67 percent. The `` other Hispanic'' category rose 31 percent, followed by Mexicans, up 30 percent, Puerto Ricans, 14 percent and Cubans, 12 percent.

 A dispute over church pension funds invested in companies operating in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> is dividing members of the <ORGANIZATION> Evangelical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lutheran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> as its pension board prepares to meet this week. A resolution ordering the board to divest all South African holdings by Sept. 1, 1991, was approved in August at the denomination's first churchwide meeting since the 1987 merger of the <ORGANIZATION> Lutheran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lutheran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Evangelical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lutheran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Churches </ORGANIZATION>. At least one congregation, Advent Lutheran Church in the <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paul </LOCATION> suburb of <LOCATION> Roseville </LOCATION>, has authorized a lawsuit to prevent the pension board from divesting, says its pastor, <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Basich </PERSON>. `` Nobody is for apartheid; I think it's awful,'' said <PERSON> Basich </PERSON>. `` The issue here is whether or not political considerations should enter into investment decisions without approval of the 26,000 people who are members of the pension fund and beneficiaries of the pension fund.'' The Rev. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ellwanger </PERSON>, of <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lutheran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Milwaukee </LOCATION>, counters: `` The bottom line must not be financial return but what is morally right.'' `` The other point is that investments in non-South African companies have indeed yielded as much as, and, in many cases, more than companies involved in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Ellwanger </PERSON>, acting treasurer of Pension Members for Justice, a grassroots Lutheran organization advocating divestiture to pressure <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> to end its policy of racial segregation known as apartheid. At stake is the denomination's $ 1.6 billion pension fund, of which $ 84.9 million is invested in companies that do business in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. Some members of the independently incorporated pension board based in <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION> also oppose the resolution. Board President <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Kapanke </PERSON> has said the board, at its monthly meeting here Thursday through Saturday, will consider seeking a court judgment on whether the board can totally divest within the bounds of its fiduciary responsibility. `` It is our opinion that the timeline as proposed puts the board in an almost impossible situation if it is to divest within a prudent policy,'' <PERSON> Kapanke </PERSON> said during the August convention. It is unclear how many of the 21-member pension board oppose divestment, or whether they have the authority to defy the assembly, <PERSON> Kapanke </PERSON> said. `` They are going to try to weigh the directive of the churchwide assembly with the fiduciary responsibility of the members,'' he said. If the board fails to meet the 1991 deadline, <PERSON> Kapanke </PERSON> said church members could institute a procedure to remove members. Several Protestant denominations, notably the <ORGANIZATION> Episcopal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christ </ORGANIZATION>, the Church of the Brethren and the <ORGANIZATION> Quakers </ORGANIZATION> already have strong divestment policies at varying stages of implementation, said <PERSON> Donna </PERSON> <PERSON> Katzin </PERSON>. She is director of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> programs for the <ORGANIZATION> Interfaith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> on Corporate Responsibility in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, an ecumenical coalition of the Lutheran body. However, the Lutheran pension board believes it's the first <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> religious denomination to set a specific date for divestment, she said. <PERSON> Ellwanger </PERSON> said the pension board knew the resolution was imminent because the new denomination's constituting convention in 1987 passed a similar resolution. `` I'm not sure that any deadline would be satisfactory to <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Kapanke </PERSON> and people against divestment,'' <PERSON> Ellwanger </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Basich </PERSON> said he does n't believe divestiture is an ethical way to end apartheid. `` I do n't think it's right for people who live 10,000 miles away to wreck another country's economy. Who's going to gain by that?'' He said members already have the option of putting their pension money in `` <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> free'' funds but that only 13 percent of pension fund contributions have been so earmarked. <PERSON> Kapanke </PERSON> said investments in non-South African companies have performed well. `` Through August 31, the social purposes equity fund -LRB- non-South African investments -RRB- was up about 28 percent,'' he said. An estimated 85 percent of the convention's 1,041 delegates voted for the divestment deadline, but <PERSON> Kapanke </PERSON> said delegates did n't fully understand the issue and called for a vote on the matter by pension plan members.

 The Legislature today killed 10 more anti-abortion bills favored by Gov. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> and sped toward early adjournment without disturbing <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s abortion law. `` A right, having been established, is not easily removed,'' said <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Speaker <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Gustafson </PERSON>, a Democrat. Four bills in the Republican governor's package were killed on Tuesday, the first day of a special session he convened to take advantage of a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruling in July opening the door to more restrictive abortion laws. Today, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Care </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> voted 5-2 to kill a proposed constitutional amendment restricting abortions to cases of rape or incest or when the mother's health is in danger or the fetus deformed. Later, the panel defeated three proposals to tighten clinic regulations, and a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee rejected six bills that mirrored the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> measures. `` I do n't think it's a moment for rejoicing,'' <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> said after the first defeat of the day. `` If anything, it's a moment of sadness.'' The proceedings were the nation's first special session on abortion since the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> upheld a restrictive <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> abortion law. <PERSON> Gustafson </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Crawford </PERSON>, also a Democrat, said they expected both houses to adjourn by late afternoon. The special session was to have lasted through Friday. `` I think the Legislature was reflecting the will of the people,'' said <PERSON> Crawford </PERSON>. Only a handful of spectators attended today's proceedings, and virtually none of the estimated 10,000 demonstraters in town Monday and Tuesday were visible today at the Capitol. In recent weeks, the first-term governor has focused on the issue of regulating clinics more closely. Three <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> clinics have been closed by the state in the last two weeks after inspectors found unhealthy conditions. On Tuesday, about 1,000 abortion-rights activists celebrated outside the Capitol. `` The real news story is that nothing is going to happen here,'' <PERSON> Kate </PERSON> <PERSON> Michelman </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Abortion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION>, told a cheering crowd. `` <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> is suffering a very embarrassing defeat.'' <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> lawmakers convened in the afternoon amid tight security after more than 10,000 pro-choice and anti-abortion demonstrators held rallies. Police guarded the doors to the Democratic-controlled <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> chambers. The abortion-rights side sang `` America the Beautiful'' and hired an airplane to trail a banner reading, `` Keep Abortion Legal.'' Anti-abortionist activists wore T-shirts with the words: `` Spoken As a Former Fetus ... I'm Glad I'm Here.'' Police made two arrests. A 14-year-old was charged with a misdemeanor for wearing a derogatory message on his jacket that referred to the governor, and a 49-year-old abortion-rights supporter was jailed on charges of striking a man in the face with a video camera. <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON>'s proposals that were defeated by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rehabilitative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> included a ban on use of public financing and public hospitals for abortions and a requirement for viability tests on the fetuses of women who are at least 20 weeks pregnant. Those bills were defeated 9-3, as was a proposal that would have required women to wait a week and undergo counseling before having an abortion. The committee said a bill to establish a state adoption center to promote adoption as an alternative to abortion was a good idea, but defeated it 8-4. Lawmakers said it should be taken up again when the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> considers child abuse reform next month. The committee action Tuesday `` was a blow to the unborn,'' said <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Conner </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Right </ORGANIZATION> to Life. Elsewhere, a legislative committee Tuesday in <LOCATION> Springfield </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, heard pro-choice advocates decry proposed curbs on late-term abortions, but the panel chairman said the bill probably would go to the House without major changes. In <LOCATION> Harrisburg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, a lawmaker introduced a bill to eliminate a law requiring rape and incest victims to report the crimes before they can get publicly funded abortions. A <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> committee set a hearing on a series of abortion-related bills for Friday.

<HEAD>Paper Says Party Must Keep Key Role in Government, Workplace</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 An official commentary Thursday condemned reformist efforts to reduce the role of <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> ideologues in government and factory management, saying this would turn the party into a mere `` after-hours club.'' The commentary in the <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> Daily blamed ousted party General Secretary <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> <PERSON> Ziyang </PERSON> for the notion that the party should stick to running itself. It was one of the harshest attacks on the purged leader in weeks. After several months of steady media condemnation, the latest official comments on <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> had taken a softer tone and credited him with contributions to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s economic reform. The hard-line commentary not only signaled that differences still exist in the leadership over how to treat <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON>, but put in doubt the future of political reforms. In the past year, the leadership has slowly stalled or reversed on key elements of its economic reform program, which sought to reduce rigid central planning. Political reforms were never given as much priority and were much less ambitious, but a basic goal was the separation of party and government functions to allow government to become more professional with a stronger legal base. Both political and economic reformists had advocated reducing the party's role in enterprises. Every enterprise has a party branch. The `` manager responsibility system,'' which allowed factory managers to make business decisions on their own as long as they could earn profits, was adopted widely over the past decade and praised for boosting production. But the <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Daily </LOCATION>, which has carried many of the media's most hard-line articles since the June crackdown on pro-democracy protests, condemned any efforts to divorce the party from the day-to-day running of the government and factories `` Reform of political structures and separating the government and party does n't mean the two are getting divorced,'' it said. `` It is intended to solidify the party's position in power and improve and strengthen its leadership.'' It accused <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> of weakening the party's base in factories, its `` major source of strength,'' by emphasizing the role of the factory director. `` He put the enterprises' party organizations in an auxiliary, subordinate role,'' it said. `` If the enterprises' party organizations are divorced from the important activities of production and business ... How can they guarantee and supervise the implementation of party and government policies?'' If the party concentrates just on running itself, the paper said, `` it ca n't be a political party, it can only be an after-hours mass organization or a club.'' It added ominously, `` As party general secretary, how could Comrade <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> <PERSON> Ziyang </PERSON> not know the party's nature and role? His purpose in putting forward the idea that the party only run itself is very clear. ... Because of his erroneous stance ... the party's work organization and full-time working staff have been slashed, people's thoughts are in chaos, and party building and party work have suffered great damage. The 69-year-old <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> was party chief for less than two years when he was ousted in June after losing a power struggle triggered by handle massive student-led demonstrations for a freer society. He has not been seen in public since May, but party and government officials say he is living comfortably at his home in party headquarters in <LOCATION> Zhongnanhai </LOCATION> in central <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. At a news conference in September, his successor, <PERSON> Jiang </PERSON> <PERSON> Zemin </PERSON>, said <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> had made contributions as party secretary and, previously, as premier. Although <PERSON> Jiang </PERSON> did not say what <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON>'s fate would be, his mild tone was taken as an indication that he was not likely to be put on trial for his alleged mistakes. When he was ousted, the party said he had supported the protests and split the party.

 Abortion is bound to wither away in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> as a political issue, some observers say, just as soon as the French `` abortion pill'' crosses the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION>, either legally or illegally. `` People on either side of the argument are spending a lot of energy and emotion on a political issue that's going to be defused,'' says <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Cole </PERSON>, who teaches in the Science, <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Program </ORGANIZATION> at <ORGANIZATION> Rutgers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J </LOCATION>. Even if the French pill does n't win the right to be marketed in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, it is bound to be smuggled in and come into widespread use, adds Cole, who has looked into the likely political consequences of an at-home abortion pill. <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Barden </PERSON>, vice president of the <ORGANIZATION> Population </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, says that with the new drug abortion will become a private decision in which even the woman taking the pill may not know whether a pregnancy had occured. That is `` what the anti-abortion people are afraid of,'' he says. And <PERSON> Werner </PERSON> <PERSON> Fornos </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Population </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, says the French pill `` will make the entire issue moot. It will take the judgmental community out of play.'' RU486, the abortion pill, has been given to 25,000 <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> women with a success rate of 96 percent in the year it has been available, according to its developer. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Right </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> to </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Life </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> predicts it can keep the abortion pill from being made or sold in this country, through a boycott of pharmaceutical companies if nothing else. `` It is going to be very difficult to find,'' predicts <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Glasow </PERSON>, education director of the committee. He sees RU486 as a `` dangerous drug'' which is being sold in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> because `` the socialist government in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> is ideologically committed to it.'' But in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, he says, `` public opinion will be against taking such a dangerous drug.'' <PERSON> Glasow </PERSON> concedes the anti-abortion movement can do little to keep pills from being smuggled into the country. `` There is going to be a certain number of people who disobey the law,'' <PERSON> Glasow </PERSON> says. `` Certainly if it is illegal there will -LRB- still -RRB- be people who use it,'' adds <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Bauer </PERSON>, former domestic policy adviser to President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. The National Organization for Women and the Fund for the Feminist Majority predict RU486 will come into use in this country within five years and say the only remaining question `` is whether it will come legally, and therefore be administered safely under a doctor's supervision, or illegally, with increased risk for women.'' Cole sees an analogy to the effort in the 1950s to block the sale of birth control devices. The instant the birth control pill came into widespread use, he says, the battle against contraception effectively ended. `` Eventually somebody is going to see the profit potential -LRB- of RU486 -RRB- as large enough to overcome the worries and the political opposition that any pill producer is bound to face,'' he says. A society that can not keep tons of cocaine from finding a market can not keep an abortion pill out, he adds. <PERSON> Etienne-Emile </PERSON> <PERSON> Bauliueu </PERSON>, developer of RU486, predicted earlier this month that Americans `` will find ways'' to have the pill distributed here. <PERSON> Baulieu </PERSON> said the pill should be taken under medical supervision. He said it can `` give more privacy to the decision of pregnancy interruption.'' RU486 is a synthetic chemical that, when taken within the first seven weeks of pregnancy, induces an abortion by causing the uterus to shed the egg. Often it must be used with a second compound, requiring two visits to a doctor. Its French manufacturer, <PERSON> Roussel </PERSON> <PERSON> Uclaf </PERSON>, is not seeking to sell licenses to market the drug in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and no application for testing is before the <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>.

 A group of militant Israelis is preparing to lay a three-ton cornerstone next week in hopes of eventually rebuilding the ancient Jewish Temple, angering Arabs and some fellow Jews. `` This is the answer to the intefadeh -LRB- Palestinian uprising -RRB- and the answer to those who are trying to destroy us,'' <PERSON> Gershon </PERSON> <PERSON> Salomon </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Temple </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mount </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Faithful </ORGANIZATION> movement, said Wednesday. The group wants to rebuild the temple that was destroyed by the Romans in 70 A.D.. An earlier temple, built by <PERSON> King </PERSON> <PERSON> Solomon </PERSON>, was destroyed by the <ORGANIZATION> Babylonians </ORGANIZATION> in 587 B.C Such a plan is provocative because the 35-acre site where the ancient temples stood includes the spot where Moslems believe the prophet <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> ascended to heaven. The platform's two mosques, the Dome of the Rock and <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Aqsa </PERSON>, are the holiest Islamic places of worship after <LOCATION> Mecca </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Medina </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>. The Temple Mount Faithful initially planned to lay the cornerstone on the platform, but police denied them permission, <PERSON> Salomon </PERSON> said. Instead, the cornerstone will be placed `` in the meantime'' near the ramp leading to the Moghrabi Gate of the mount, he said. The ceremony is scheduled for Monday. <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> police spokesman <PERSON> Uzi </PERSON> <PERSON> Sandori </PERSON> confirmed the <ORGANIZATION> Temple </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mount </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Faithful </ORGANIZATION> has permission for a ceremony near the gate. `` If it causes a disturbance or damage, we will of course stop them,'' <PERSON> Sandori </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Adnan </PERSON> <PERSON> Husseini </PERSON>, director general of the Moslem trust that administers the mosques, said he did not know what Moslem reaction would be. `` They know well that the Moslems know how to take care of their mosques,'' <PERSON> Husseini </PERSON> said. `` The police and God will save the mosques because they are for people praying.'' Rabbi <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hirsch </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Progressive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judaism </ORGANIZATION>, the international office for <ORGANIZATION> Reform </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judaism </ORGANIZATION>, criticized <PERSON> Salomon </PERSON> and his movement. `` I consider their version of Judaism to be a perversion of Judaism and their acts to be a retrogressive negative force,'' he told The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. He added: `` We consider any attempt at this time to inject an issue such as a reconstruction of a Temple in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> to be a negative, divisive, deleterious force.'' A spokesman for Conservative Jews said <PERSON> Salomon </PERSON> and his group were motivated by politics, not religion. `` He is attempting to make a political provocation, and we are very opposed to this,'' said Rabbi <PERSON> Ehud </PERSON> <PERSON> Bandel </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION>'s education and outreach department. <PERSON> Salomon </PERSON> said he did not care what the Arab reaction would be. `` I do n't want to hear an answer from the Arabs,'' he said. `` We think that the Arab period in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and on the <ORGANIZATION> Temple </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mount </ORGANIZATION> has come to an end.''

 A U.S.-Soviet pact reducing strategic nuclear arms is unlikely before President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s summit next year with Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, a leading House Republican said Wednesday. Rep. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Broomfield </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, ranking <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> member on the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said unresolved issues will delay a superpower agreement. <PERSON> Broomfield </PERSON> recently met with arms control negotiators during a congressional delegation's trip to <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>. He based his comments on statements made by the Soviets negotiators, including the chief negotiator, <PERSON> Yuriy </PERSON> <PERSON> Nazarkin </PERSON>. `` The Soviet negotiators view the likelihood -LRB- of a START treaty -RRB- as very doubtful'' prior to the summit scheduled for late spring or early summer next year, <PERSON> Broomfield </PERSON> said in an interview. The lawmaker said a number of `` troubling'' problems still have to be worked out. He declined to provide specifics. However, <PERSON> Broomfield </PERSON> said he is optimistic that a U.S.-Soviet agreement will be reached to slash the superpowers' store of long-range nuclear missiles by 30 percent to 50 percent. `` Eventually,'' he said. `` It wo n't be a rushed job ... for signing at the summit.'' Shortly after meetings last month in <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> between Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> and Soviet Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> indicated that a strategic arms control treaty was possible. `` Yes, I do,'' the president said in response to questions on the chance of a treaty. `` I think the setting of a summit will perhaps serve as a catalyst for moving forward. `` But it's not a given, it's not absolutely certain that that's going to happen But I would agree that we have a good likelihood that might happen,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
 Suspected tribal militants detonated a bomb under a police bus in northeastern <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> on Wednesday, killing 11 people, news reports said. Seven of the dead were policemen. Press Trust of <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> said the blast occurred on a remote, hilly road in <LOCATION> Assam </LOCATION> state's <LOCATION> Nalbari </LOCATION> district, 850 miles east of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION>. Besides the police, the dead were the driver of the bus and three civilians who had hitched a ride, the news agency said. The bomb, detonated by remote control, was believed to have been planted by extremists of the <PERSON> Bodo </PERSON> tribe who are fighting to set up an independent homeland in <LOCATION> Assam </LOCATION>, a hilly state bordering <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Bhutan </LOCATION>, the news agency said. The area is a militant stronghold. The tribes took to arms two years ago, and at least 290 people have been killed in violence this year. The government has refused to break up <LOCATION> Assam </LOCATION> into two states but says it is willing to hold talks with the militants who allege discrimination in jobs and education by the state's majority non-tribal population. The Bodos, mostly farmers, were animists before they converted earlier this century to Christianity and <LOCATION> Hinduism </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s dominant religion. The Bodos make up about 30 percent of <LOCATION> Assam </LOCATION>'s 20 million people.

 Cracks are appearing in the once solid anti-reform communist governments of <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> although there's been no real progress toward democracy, senior <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials said Wednesday. The officials pointed to recent moves by the mayors and other authorities in <LOCATION> Leipzig </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Dresden </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, to open a dialogue with pro-democracy demonstrators as an indication resistance may be growing to the communist government's anti-reform stance. `` There seems to be some indication of a split,'' <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Schifter </PERSON>, assistant secretary of state for human rights told the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. `` It could be that some people see the handwriting is on the wall and prefer to go with change rather than sticking with the old men'' who rule <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Schifter </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Curtis </PERSON> <PERSON> Kamman </PERSON>, deputy assistant secretary of state for <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> affairs, agreed that the mayors' action could be significant. `` I hope that that continues and that it represents movement,'' he said. <PERSON> Kamman </PERSON> said that while the role of the Communist party remains paramount in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION>, the ferment of the Democratic reform movement in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> `` can not fail to have an impact.'' `` Already splits are occuring in the formerly solid anti-reform regime front in -LRB- <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> -RRB- and <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>, although both still have a long way to go,'' <PERSON> Kamman </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Kamman </PERSON> said he believes change is so far advanced in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, where a `` genuine rebirth of politics is under way,'' that it is difficult to see how it could be reversed. `` It is very hard to go in another direction unless you bring repressive force to bear, and I do n't think anyone in those countries wants to do that,'' <PERSON> Kamman </PERSON> said. Rep. <PERSON> Steny </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoyer </PERSON>, D-Md., co-chairman of the watchdog <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> on Security and Cooperation in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, told the panel that despite official resistance and oppression, `` the thousands of East Germans marching to the American civil rights song ` We Shall Overcome' ... bring hope that independent activity will broaden and become a powerful force for reform.

 A human rights activist who has gone underground failed to appear in the Brno regional court Wednesday to appeal his sentence, witnesses said. <PERSON> Stanislav </PERSON> <PERSON> Devaty </PERSON> was sentenced to 20 months in prison on Aug. 29 on charges of `` inciting hostile moods in the population'' after he was involved in `` production of printed material and organized petitions in its support,'' the state news agency <ORGANIZATION> CTK </ORGANIZATION> said. <PERSON> Devaty </PERSON>, 37, was released from custody after the sentencing pending an appeal of his conviction, and he apparently went underground after that. Activist <PERSON> Jana </PERSON> <PERSON> Petrova </PERSON> brought a letter from <PERSON> Devaty </PERSON> to the <LOCATION> Brno </LOCATION> court in which he said he would remain underground until the charges were annulled, emigre sources in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> said, speaking on condition of anonymity. After the sentence was pronounced, <PERSON> Devaty </PERSON> said, `` None of us doubts that this trial should be considered a political trial.'' <PERSON> Vaclav </PERSON> <PERSON> Havel </PERSON>, the banned playwright and unofficial leader of Czechoslovak opposition, called <PERSON> Devaty </PERSON>'s decision to go underground `` an experiment and a very respectable decision ... in continuity with his attitude,'' speaking to reporters outside the courtroom Wednesday. <PERSON> Devaty </PERSON> was initially detained March 16, as part of a mass crackdown on dissent that included the jailing of <PERSON> Havel </PERSON> and other leading activists. <PERSON> Devaty </PERSON> was tried in connection with a petition signed by more than 400 people calling for more religious an cultural freedom and the release of all political prisoners. <PERSON> Havel </PERSON>, meanwhile, said he had not known in advance about the publication of his picture and a birthday greeting in the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> daily newspaper Rude Pravo. A picture of <PERSON> Havel </PERSON> appeared in the paper Saturday with an accompanying birthday greeting to <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> Vanek </PERSON>, a name <PERSON> Havel </PERSON> used in some of his plays. The message said <PERSON> Havel </PERSON>'s `` friends and colleagues thank him for the hard work he has done and is still doing in his life, send many greetings and wish him a lot of success in his work.'' <PERSON> Havel </PERSON> turned 53 on Oct. 5. <PERSON> Havel </PERSON>'s picture has not appeared in the official Czechoslovak press since the 1968 Soviet-led invasion that quashed the `` Prague Spring'' liberalization reforms of <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Dubcek </PERSON>. It was printed in the personal columns apparently unwittingly by the paper's editors `` I consider it a good prank, but I certainly did not do it,'' <PERSON> Havel </PERSON> said about the publication of the picture under the pseudonym. `` It is not my habit to congratulate myself.'' `` It was done by a group of admirers unknown to me, but I thank them, it made me very happy,'' <PERSON> Havel </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> in a telephone interview.

 With <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Pauley </PERSON>'s 39th birthday looming and her 13th year on `` Today'' noted, the only question Wednesday was whether she'd stay on the top-rated, troubled morning show. Neither she nor <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> would say. All <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> would say in response to a published report that <PERSON> Pauley </PERSON> probably would leave the show at year's end was that <PERSON> Pauley </PERSON>, who has two years left on her contract, would stay at the network. `` As <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Pauley </PERSON> has stated, she will be staying on with NBC News,'' <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> said in a statement. `` Conversations about specifics are concluding now and we expect to announce our mutual plans shortly.'' <PERSON> Pauley </PERSON>, who did n't return phone calls on the 13th anniversary of her joining the show, reportedly has been upset over changes at `` Today,'' including a switch of news anchors in which `` NBC News at Sunrise'' anchor <PERSON> Deborah </PERSON> <PERSON> Norville </PERSON> last month was made the `` Today'' news anchor. That job had been held by <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Palmer </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> correspondent, since 1982. He now anchors the earlier `` Sunrise.'' There has been speculation, about which <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> wo n't comment, that <PERSON> Norville </PERSON> is being considered as the next `` Today'' co-anchor. She was given a five-year contract in August. <PERSON> Peggy </PERSON> <PERSON> Hubble </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman, declined to say Wednesday when or if <PERSON> Pauley </PERSON> will be leaving `` Today,'' which she co-anchors with <PERSON> Bryant </PERSON> <PERSON> Gumbel </PERSON>. `` We're discussing her role with NBC News,'' Hubble said. As for `` Today'' and <LOCATION> Pauley </LOCATION>, she said, `` I think it's premature to make any specific announcement.'' She said she did n't know when one would be made. <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> president <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Gartner </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sports </ORGANIZATION> president <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Ebersol </PERSON>, who oversees `` Today,'' and <PERSON> Pauley </PERSON>'s agent, <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Mann </PERSON>, did not return calls. Secretaries said the three executives were out. <PERSON> Pauley </PERSON>, who turns 39 on Oct. 31, succeeded <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Walters </PERSON>, the first female co-anchor of `` Today,'' in 1976. At that time, <PERSON> Walters </PERSON> left to join <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> after 15 years on `` Today,'' on which she started as a writer.

 Democrat <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON> is on the offensive in the <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> governor's race with a groundbreaking television commercial on abortion that challenges a decade of political wisdom. `` <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> wants to take away your right to choose and give it to the politicians,'' says the announcer, while the screen shows pictures of the American flag and a statue of <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Jefferson </PERSON>. `` He wants to go back to outlawing abortion _ even in cases of rape and incest.'' <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON>'s ad _ attacked by <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> as an attempt to `` spread fear'' _ is crafted to appeal to conservatives as well as liberals by framing the abortion issue as one of personal liberty and freedom of choice. His decision to focus on abortion challenges recent trends in which the issue has played a major role in defeating several Democratic candidates. And in an off-year campaign season, <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON>'s approach is being watched closely, especially in the wake of a <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruling that permits states to put greater restrictions on abortions Each side in the bitter abortion debate claims it is gaining strength after the court decision, with pro-choice groups saying their supporters will be energized by the threat of greater restrictions. The issue is being played out in other campaigns, as well. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> gubernatorial candidate <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Courter </PERSON> has softened his anti-abortion position. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, Republican mayoral candidate <PERSON> Rudolph </PERSON> <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON> has moderated his views, as well, to the point where <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> Cardinal <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> has publicly criticized unnamed candidates who engage in `` what I consider political evasion.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION>, called into special session by Republican Gov. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> to consider stricter limits on abortion, swiftly killed a series of anti-abortion measures and headed for adjournment Wednesday without approval of any of the governor's proposals. `` If anything, it's a moment of sadness,'' <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> said. `` A right, having been established, is not easily removed,'' said <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Speaker <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Gustafson </PERSON>, a Democrat. But the most dramatic test is unfolding in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, where <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON> is trying to become the first black ever elected to govern a state. `` Ultimately this will hurt <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON>,'' says <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Steen </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Right </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> to </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Life </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. said. `` There are more people against abortion than for abortion.'' But <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Greer </PERSON>, <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> campaign consultant who made the commercial, says otherwise. `` There are those who would say do n't go out an a limb on the abortion issue because it's a liberal issue,'' said <PERSON> Greer </PERSON>. `` I think it's a very conservative issue.'' <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> won a tough Republican primary emphasizing his opposition to abortion in nearly all cases, excepting only those where a mother's life is endangered by pregnancy. And after winning the nomination, <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> said he would not press an earlier pledge to try to outlaw abortions arising from rape and incest and in most other cases, saying there was no chance the legislature would pass such a law. <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON> has said he supports keeping <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>'s abortion laws, which generally impose few restrictions, although he has said he might sign a law requiring parental consent for abortions on minors. The <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> race has mobilized national interest groups. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Abortion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION>, an abortion rights group, has run full-page newspaper ads and is beginning its own independent television ad campaign attacking <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON>. The National Right to <ORGANIZATION> Life </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> is at work in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> but is staying out of the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> race, said executive director <PERSON> O'Steen </PERSON>. He said his group is airing television ads around <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, except in the affluent <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> suburbs of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON>'s commercial is directed at the state's conservative resistance to government intrusion in personal affairs in what <PERSON> Greer </PERSON> says is an effort to tap the same vein as a campaign against gun-control laws might. `` In <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, we have a strong tradition of freedom and individual liberty _ rights that are now in danger in the race for governor,'' the announcer says in the ad. `` <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON> believes that government should n't interfere in your right to choose. He wants to keep the politicians out of your personal life. Do n't let <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> take us back.'' Independent public opinion polls have shown a trend in <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON>'s direction in the three weeks since he began airing the commercial His campaign has spent more than $ 500,000 airing the ad so far, and he plans another on the subject. Meanwhile, <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> has begun to fight back. In a statewide televised debate Monday, <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> made an issue of <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON>'s ad and charged the Democrat was trying to `` to spread fear _ fear from a single, divisive issue.'' <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON>'s campaign and national Democratic observers say their polling in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> shows 60 percent support for maintaining abortion rights _ and that that figure has grown by 10 percentage points since <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON> began airing his ad. A decade ago, abortion was used as an issue against several incumbent <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> senators who were denied re-election. With the emergence of <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> in 1980 as the Republican presidential nominee, the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> platform took its strongest stand ever against abortion. But the abortion debate has taken on a new political intensity across the country since the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>'s ruling in a case last July. In that <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> case, the court stopped short of reversing its 1973 decision upholding abortion rights, but gave the states leeway in imposing regulations on most abortions.

<HEAD>Soviet TV Shows Report on Voronezh `Aliens'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Soviet TV viewers Wednesday night got a chance to see the aliens that created a cosmic sensation with their reported landing in the town of <LOCATION> Voronezh </LOCATION> _ but only in a child's scribbled drawing. The Soviet nightly news program `` Vremya'' broadcast a report from <LOCATION> Voronezh </LOCATION> showing the spot among yellow-leaved birches where, according to the official news agency <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION>, scientists confirmed an unearthly craft had touched down. The picture, by a child who claimed to have witnessed the landing, showed a glowing two-legged sphere with a smiling stick figure inside. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> made a worldwide splash Monday with its straight-faced report on towering, pin-headed aliens who emerged from a spaceship that landed in a park in <LOCATION> Voronezh </LOCATION>, 300 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. Since then, scientists have disparaged the report and attributed it to rising sensationalism in the Soviet press under `` glasnost,'' or greater openness. The `` Vremya'' report, although more skeptical in tone than that by <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION>, offered without comment an interview with schoolboy <PERSON> Vasya </PERSON> <PERSON> Surin </PERSON>, a purported witness to the `` close encounter.'' `` We were scared,'' said <PERSON> Vasya </PERSON>, who appeared to be about 11. `` It hovered over this tree. Then the door opened and a tall person of about three meters -LRB- three yards -RRB- looked out. He did n't have a head, or shoulders either. He just had a kind of hump. There he had three eyes, two on each side and one in the middle.'' <PERSON> Vasya </PERSON> said the alien had two holes instead of a real nose, and could not turn his head, so he had to swivel his middle eye. An aviation engineer from a nearby factory said he and his colleagues measured the landing area and found an intense magnetic field there. But the `` Vremya'' report concluded with some of the many factors that detract from the credibility of the sighting: _ No adult witnesses could be found even though a large apartment house overlooked the site. _ The story spread only a week after the supposed event when an article appeared in the local newspaper. _ Supposed alien minerals turned out to be of the earthly type. `` Only one thing is clear,'' concluded Soviet TV reporter <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Maximov </PERSON>. `` It's early to tell. What's needed is research. And not by <LOCATION> Voronezh </LOCATION> enthusiasts, but by experts.''

<HEAD>Inmates Lay Trail of False Clues of `Escape,' Hide in Prison</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LANSING, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Two inmates planted false clues hinting that they had escaped from the world's largest walled prison and then hid inside the facility for a week while authorities conducted a three-state, $ 100,000 manhunt. The two men concealed themselves in a four-foot hollowed-out stack of boxes and apparently planned to scale the walls of the State Prison of <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> at <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> when the search died down, said <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corrections </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Gail </PERSON> <PERSON> Light </PERSON>. However, Detective Sgt. <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Boyer </PERSON> said Wednesday no one is red-faced about falling for the ploy by <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Bellah </PERSON>, 42, and <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Mikko </PERSON>, 27, who were found Tuesday after officials were tipped to their hiding place. `` I'm not embarrassed in the least bit. We had information to believe these guys were outside and we followed up on it,'' he said. `` ... If you have a crow pie that you want me to eat, I'd be glad to.'' <PERSON> Boyer </PERSON> estimated state police spent more than $ 100,000 searching for the inmates within <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>. The search extended to <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION>, where <PERSON> Bellah </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mikko </PERSON> had friends and relatives. The two, discovered missing on Oct. 4 during a routine count, were thought to have walked out disguised as guards, <PERSON> Boyer </PERSON> said, because negatives left in their cells indicated they had made false badges and a note said they had bought guard uniforms for $ 250. <PERSON> Mikko </PERSON> also arranged for a cousin who lived in the area to call a probation officer to say she had been asked to pick up the two on the day of the reported escape in <LOCATION> Rives </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Junction </LOCATION>, about 10 miles north of <LOCATION> Jackson </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Boyer </PERSON> said. `` It certainly leads a reasonable person to believe they had escaped from prison,'' said <PERSON> Boyer </PERSON>, adding that the size of the 57-acre institution made it difficult to search it thoroughly. Light said prison officials were suspicious and received several tips that the two were still inside the prison. `` The evidence left in the cell was so obvious we had some doubts whether it was legitimate evidence or whether they were trying to distract us,'' she said. Light declined to reveal the source of Tuesday's tip that paid off. `` We searched the prison every single day and continuously since they left. We never stopped looking for these guys,'' said <PERSON> Marcia </PERSON> <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON>, administrative assistant to the warden at <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bellah </PERSON> was convicted of killing a <LOCATION> Lansing </LOCATION> police officer during a 1977 bank robbery. <PERSON> Mikko </PERSON> is serving 25-40 years on an armed robbery conviction in <LOCATION> Montcalm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>. The two went undetected in a hollowed out, four-foot stack of boxes in a furniture factory on the prison grounds even though the area had been searched with tracking dogs, <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON> said. Light said a spring mechanism allowed the men to tighten the metal strap on the outside of the stack to make it appear the stack of boxes was solid. The pair had a homemade grappling hook and 84 feet of rope made from nylon laundry bags. They apparently intended to scale the 28-foot prison wall, she said. The two had a supply of apples, candy bars and water, and officials speculated that other inmates brought them food, Light said. <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON> said the men were armed with crude knives but offered no resistance when found. They are being held in administrative segregation and <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON> said they will face misconduct hearings. They could be placed in a higher custody level and have time outside their cells restricted. Before the escape, the men were listed as `` close custody'' prisoners, a level below maximum security, and could leave their cells during the day for work and recreation. <LOCATION> Jackson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Prosecuting Attorney <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Filip </PERSON> said no criminal charges will be filed. The potential two - to five-year sentences would have less impact than prison disciplinary steps, he said, noting <PERSON> Bellah </PERSON> already is serving a mandatory life sentence Authorities said <PERSON> Mikko </PERSON> had attempted escapes at least twice before.

 <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday tentatively rescheduled the launch of Atlantis for Tuesday as technicians began the laborious job of replacing the faulty engine computer that scrubbed the flight. `` There is a 50-50 chance of completing the necesary work'' in time for a Tuesday launch, a statement said. It said shuttle managers would meet at noon Saturday to decide whether to aim for that date or to try for Wednesday. A launch Tuesday, five days later than the original launch date, would take place during a 24-minute period beginning at 12:57 p.m. The launch date for Atlantis and five astronauts with a nuclear-powered planetary package will depend on how work progresses in swapping and checking the master control computer in main engine No. 2. Technicans opened Atlantis' cramped engine compartment Wednesday and set up work platforms so they could gain access to the bad computer. It is to be removed and a new one installed Friday. `` It's a crowded place to work and it's not easy,'' said <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Crippen </PERSON>, head of a <ORGANIZATION> Mission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Team </ORGANIZATION> which set the new launch date. Officials had said earlier that Monday was the earliest possible date. The delay was announced Tuesday night just 90 minutes after a federal judge rejected a request by three anti-nuclear groups to halt the flight. The groups claimed the shuttle's Jupiter-bound <ORGANIZATION> Galileo </ORGANIZATION> payload could scatter its radioactive plutonium fuel over <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> if there were an accident during launch. <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> wants to launch Atlantis and get <ORGANIZATION> Galileo </ORGANIZATION> on its way as soon as possible because <ORGANIZATION> Jupiter </ORGANIZATION> will be in the proper position only until Nov. 21; any delay beyond that would put the space probe's flight off until mid-1991 Atlantis' commander, <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, said Wednesday he was disappointed the launch was postponed but said he agreed with the decision because `` safety is an overriding concern.'' He spoke to reporters before he and his four crew members flew back to their training base in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> to rehearse in a shuttle simulator. They plan to return here two days before the new launch day. `` We understand what happened and why and we concur wholeheartedly and sincerely in the decision,'' <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said. `` In manned space flight, we obviously take a great deal of effort to make everything fail-safe. We should never, ever deviate from that.'' At launch pad 39B, technicians were working on a schedule aimed at completing computer removal, replacement and checkout by late Saturday. Once the task is completed, <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> could resume the countdown, which was halted at the 19-hour mark. More than 15 hours of hold time is built into the count in case of contingencies, so the countdown time remaining is about 34 hours. The computer, which weighs 230 pounds and is about the size of a 17-inch portable television, controls all functions on one of the shuttle's three main engines during liftoff. It became necessary to remove the device, called a master controller, when engineers were unable to determine why it had given a false fuel pump pressure reading. Shuttle workers received the bad news not long after <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> Gasch </PERSON> ruled in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> that they could proceed with launch preparations. `` The court concludes that <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> has complied with requirements of the National Environmental Protection Act,'' <PERSON> Gasch </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> attorneys representing the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> argued that <ORGANIZATION> Galileo </ORGANIZATION>'s $ 1.5 billion, six-year mission to <ORGANIZATION> Jupiter </ORGANIZATION> carried very low risks. They said the nuclear generators were well shielded and similar to 38 generators that have flown on 22 previous space missions. <PERSON> Gasch </PERSON>'s ruling came on a request for a temporary restraining order, a ruling that ca n't be appealed. The plaintiffs said they were going back to <PERSON> Gasch </PERSON> to seek a preliminary injunction, whose refusal can be appealed. The anti-nuclear groups said that if they lost in court they would try to halt the launch by infiltrating Kennedy Space Center on launch day.

<TEXT>
 Attorney General <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON>'s trips cost the government more than twice as much as those taken by his predecessor during a nearly comparable period, the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday. <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON>'s 47 trips aboard government aircraft between Oct. 7, 1988, and Sept. 4 cost $ 154,618, compared with $ 74,247 Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> spent during his last 10 months in office, according to records furnished by spokesman <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Runkel </PERSON>. <PERSON> Runkel </PERSON> attributed much of the increased expense to three flights aboard <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Marshals </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> airplanes that cost $ 80,171. `` The only difference is when you include the incredible charges of the <ORGANIZATION> Marshals </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>,'' he said. Travel records show that a <ORGANIZATION> Marshals </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> twin-engine jet flew from <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION> on May 16 to pick up <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> at 9:40 a.m. and fly him back to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> at a cost of $ 5,260. The night before, <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> had flown from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION> aboard an <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> turboprop plane. That trip cost $ 730, according to <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> records. While in <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> voted in the <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> primary, spoke to <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents at the local field office and was interviewed by radio station <ORGANIZATION> KDKA </ORGANIZATION>. A letter the <ORGANIZATION> Marshals </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>'s public affairs chief, <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Boyle </PERSON>, wrote last week to two news organizations detailing the expenses said the plane for the <LOCATION> Pittsburgh-to-Washington </LOCATION> flight was requested May 12. <PERSON> Boyle </PERSON> said he did n't know why <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> requested the plane. <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON>'s tab at the <ORGANIZATION> Marshals </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> also includes $ 46,792 for an Aug. 6-9 trip to <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> for a meeting with <LOCATION> Mexican </LOCATION> officials and to <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION> where the attorney general addressed the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> convention, according to <PERSON> Boyle </PERSON>'s letter, written in response to queries by <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> Times. <PERSON> Runkel </PERSON> made <PERSON> Boyle </PERSON>'s letter and a similar response by <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Milt </PERSON> <PERSON> Ahlerich </PERSON> available to reporters. <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> and five aides flew aboard a <ORGANIZATION> Marshals </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 727 airliner from <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION> because the plane used during the earlier legs of the trip was unable to fly non-stop from the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Runkel </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 727, normally used to transport prisoners, was pressed into service because another plane that <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> originally planned to use for the entire trip had broken down before he left <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Runkel </PERSON> said. A June 12-14 trip to <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> aboard a twin-engine <ORGANIZATION> Marshals </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> jet that flew from <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> to pick up <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> and several aides cost $ 28,118. The airplane was requested two weeks in advance, according to <PERSON> Boyle </PERSON>'s letter. The expense of the attorney general's travels also included what it cost for aides to accompany him on the trips, <PERSON> Runkel </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Runkel </PERSON> said he did n't understand why the <ORGANIZATION> Marshals </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> billing system makes flights on its planes significantly more expensive than those aboard <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> aircraft. <PERSON> Boyle </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s management division `` went over the bills in some detail before they reimbursed us to determine if they were indeed valid and justifiable and apparently felt they were because they paid the bill'' for all three flights. The Marshals Service includes the cost of fuel, <PERSON> Boyle </PERSON> said. The figures for <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s travels covered the period from Oct. 1, 1987, until he left office Aug. 8, 1988. <PERSON> Runkel </PERSON> said $ 62,000 of the $ 74,247 was for trips aboard <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> aircraft. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> flew on commercial airlines for the other trips. <PERSON> Runkel </PERSON> did not have figures for the number of trips <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> took. The total figures provided by <PERSON> Runkel </PERSON> include an additional three weeks for <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON>, during which he spent $ 5,256 on travel. <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> has been flying aboard government aircraft on the advice of the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>, which determined that his security communications could not be guaranteed aboard commercial flights, <PERSON> Runkel </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> has traveled frequently because he wants to speak to groups of federal prosecutors and law enforcement officials around the country, <PERSON> Runkel </PERSON> said. `` That's part of his job to speak about what the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> is doing,'' <PERSON> Runkel </PERSON> said.

 Cigarette vending machines will be snuffed out in this <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paul </LOCATION> suburb in 90 days by an ordinance passed by the city council, a move one health expert calls the first of its kind in the country. The measure, passed 4-1 Tuesday, calls for the removal of the 19 cigarette vending machines in bars, gas stations, convenience stores and apartment and office buildings in this town of 24,000. The law was backed by the city Fire Department, several <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Minnesota </ORGANIZATION> researchers, the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lake </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> and a coalition of business leaders. `` We believe <LOCATION> White </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bear </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> is the first city in the country to ban cigarette vending machines,'' <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> <PERSON> Forster </PERSON>, assistant professor of public health at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Minnesota </ORGANIZATION>, said after the vote. Council member <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennis </PERSON>, in casting his dissent, said, `` Machines are not attacking the real problem. If merchants are sincere about this, they'd take cigarettes out of their place of business.'' A local group called the <ORGANIZATION> Tobacco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Free </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Youth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Project </ORGANIZATION>, whose members have interviewed juvenile smokers, maintains that 93 percent get their cigarettes from machines. Nationally, an estimated 3.5 million youngsters ages 12 to 17 consume $ 1 billion in tobacco a year. Past studies have indicated that half of all smokers begin at age 13. Eighteen months ago, <LOCATION> White </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bear </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> police started arresting juveniles caught smoking in public. So far, 155 teen-agers have been arrested and ordered to attend a two-night lecture and discussion session at the White Bear Lake Community Counseling Center. Of that group, just a handful were caught a second time and sent back for another dose of counseling, authorities said. About two dozen youths who failed to report for counseling were fined $ 25 to $ 100 in juvenile court.

<HEAD>HUD Review Questions $4.7 Million in Spending By Housing Agency</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JENNIFER DIXON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Federal investigators have asked the <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Antonio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION> to account for $ 4.7 million in questionable spending and repay $ 84,260 used to finance such items as Rotary Club memberships and banquets. In a review dated Oct. 3 by the inspector general's office at the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION>, investigators said there were possible violations of law or conflicts of interest in several areas, including procurement and contracting practices and the use of non-profit corporations. The report said the agency may have spent $ 3.8 million alone on questionable contracts, including goods and services obtained without competitive bidding. The agency may have also overpaid one of its non-profit corporations at least $ 255,344 for windows, screens and doors, the review said. The remainder of the questioned spending included such items as unsupported payment vouchers and $ 129,000 in paid sick leave. <PERSON> Apolonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Flores </PERSON>, the housing agency's executive director, disputed each of the 14 separate allegations. He defended the use of low-income housing funds for a Rotary membership, the soliciation of $ 1,800 in donations from contractors and businesses for a Hispanic chamber of commerce mixer, and said the non-profit corporations saved the agency $ 3 million. `` There's nothing we're not prepared to defend,'' <PERSON> Flores </PERSON> said. He accused <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> investigators of not examining his agency's records or talking with his staff, although there were seven or eight or them in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION> for about three months. The report said two of the agency's non-profit corporations realized receipts over expenses _ mostly through transactions between the corporations and federally funded housing programs for the poor _ but did not pass those savings on to low-income projects. As a result, the housing authority `` may not have operated its housing projects in the manner prescribed by <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> state law and a conflict of interest may have occured,'' the review said. As of Jan. 31, the <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Antonio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assistance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> had a balance of $ 285,922 while the <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Antonio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Facilities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> had a balance of $ 1.2 million and investments totaling nearly $ 4.8 million. Under <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> law, the report said, there does not appear to be any provision for the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION> housing authority to maintain such a fund balance. `` Accordingly, the SAHAC might be required to use any excess of reciepts over expenses soley to make decent, safe and sanitary housing available for persons of low income,'' the review said. The report also said the housing authority, through the <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Antonio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Facilities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, purchased a private housing project for $ 1.13 million that rents to non-low income individuals and families. Under <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> law, however, a housing authority may rent or lease housing only to people of low income. Of the $ 84,260 that the inspector general has recommended the agency be required to repay, $ 73,857 was charged to federal programs for such items as banquets, computer hardware and office furniture for the low-income housing projects, <ORGANIZATION> Rotary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> membership fees, and tax handbooks and publications. Another $ 1,800 was improperly solicited from businesses and contractors to pay for the chamber mixer in October 1988, the report said. The investigators made their recommendations for action to the <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> regional administrator in <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION>. The authority has 60 days to respond to the review, while the administrator has six months to decide how to proceed.

 Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> crossed the <LOCATION> Indonesian </LOCATION> archipelago on Wednesday to take his pilgrimage to <PERSON> Flores </PERSON>, the `` island of flowers,'' a <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> stronghold in a sea of Islam. The pope flew in a C-130 military transport after changing planes in <LOCATION> Dili </LOCATION>, giving him a preview of his stop Thursday in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Timor </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Indonesian </LOCATION> authorities had erected a billboard at the airport with a picture of the pontiff and President <PERSON> Suharto </PERSON> that says `` Welcome Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> to <LOCATION> Timor </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION>'s 27th Province.'' <LOCATION> Indonesian </LOCATION> forces invaded the former <LOCATION> Portuguese </LOCATION> territory in late 1975 and annexed it the following year. The dusty island of <PERSON> Flores </PERSON> prepared for days for the papal visit, being overwhelmingly <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> in the world's most populous Moslem country. The <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> estimates nearly 85 percent of <PERSON> Flores </PERSON>' 663,000 residents are Catholics Roman Catholics number about 5 million in <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION>, compared to the 157 million Moslems. Lying offshore was an <LOCATION> Indonesian </LOCATION> warship, part of security precautions for the pope's overnight stop. Church officials expected about 250,000 people at a papal Mass in a soccer stadium. The pope told them Catholics can play an important role in <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION>. `` You understand the enormity of the task facing your country in providing better education and training, more jobs and just wages, and a more equitable distribution of the advantages of economic and cultural development,'' he said. `` Your Christian faith urges you to be involved in this great undertaking.'' The pope flew 940 miles eastward from <LOCATION> Jakarta </LOCATION> to reach this island that was first settled by Portuguese and Dutch explorers. Meanwhile, news reports in <LOCATION> Lisbon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION>, said Wednesday that nationalist rebels fighting <LOCATION> Indonesian </LOCATION> rule in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Timor </LOCATION> called a 5-hour cease-fire in their 14-year-old guerrilla struggle while <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> visits the Southeast Asian territory. <PERSON> Abilio </PERSON> <PERSON> Araujo </PERSON>, a Lisbon-based official of the Revolutionary Front for an <LOCATION> Independent </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Timor </LOCATION>, or FRETILIN, said the movement's central committee called the truce at a clandestine meeting Tuesday in central Timor, the <LOCATION> Portuguese </LOCATION> news agency <ORGANIZATION> Lusa </ORGANIZATION> reported. <PERSON> Araujo </PERSON> said the rebels called on their <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> supporters to attend the papal Mass and pray for withdrawal of <LOCATION> Indonesian </LOCATION> troops from the territory. The <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> does not recognize the annexation of <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Timor </LOCATION> and has continued to keep the bishop of <LOCATION> Timor </LOCATION> under its direct control. He is not a member of <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION>'s conference of bishops. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON>'s decision to visit the territory touched off controversy. FRETILIN officials said the trip implies a tacit recognition of the occupation. However, the <PERSON> pope </PERSON> told reporters accompanying his Asian tour that to skip the territory would be an `` offense'' to <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Timor </LOCATION>'s Catholics Human rights groups estimate about 100,000 Timorese have died from fighting, famine or disease since the <LOCATION> Indonesian </LOCATION> invasion. Under international law, <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION> is still the administrative power in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Timor </LOCATION>.

The defense painted a different picture in its summation, telling the 12 jurors in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> federal court to acquit the Garcias by rejecting testimony from the prosecution's star witness, former <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> vice chairman <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Moreno </PERSON>. `` There are many reasons to doubt <PERSON> Moreno </PERSON>'s testimony _ reasons based on lies, told and untold crimes and his willingness to do anything to evade justice,'' said <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Fischetti </PERSON>, the lawyer for <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON>. <PERSON> Fischetti </PERSON> said <PERSON> Moreno </PERSON>, who pleaded guilty to theft - and bribe-related charges in 1987 and testified at other <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> trials, was a `` perjurer, liar and thief. <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON>, a 56-year-old <PERSON> Bronx </PERSON> <PERSON> Democrat </PERSON>, and his wife are accused of conspiring to obtain $ 185,000 in checks and interest-free loans, and a diamond and emerald necklace for Mrs. <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON>, from officials of the now-defunct <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. Their trial is the last of several to stem from the scandal at <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION>, the small <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bronx </LOCATION> machine shop that grew into a multimillion-dollar defense contractor through various bribe schemes The company collapsed in 1986 amid allegations of corruption. <PERSON> Hirshman </PERSON> said the relationship between <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> started out legitimately, with the congressman using his influence to help <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> secure government contracts. This changed, she said, when financial problems prompted the <ORGANIZATION> Garcias </ORGANIZATION> to seek money from <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION>. The prosecutor said their dealings turned into extortion in May 1984 when the congressman told <PERSON> Moreno </PERSON> that his power in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> was growing and then asked him to hire his wife. When <PERSON> Moreno </PERSON> balked, saying it would be improper, Mrs. <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> suggested the payments be made through a lawyer friend in <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Vallone </PERSON>, <PERSON> Hirshman </PERSON> said. The prosecution claims that in 1984 through 1986, <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> sent <PERSON> Vallone </PERSON> $ 86,100 of which $ 76,000 was transferred to Mrs. <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON>'s consulting firm <PERSON> Fischetti </PERSON> said he did not dispute that Mrs. <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> received money from <PERSON> Vallone </PERSON>, but he claims the payments were for work unrelated to <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Fischetti </PERSON> said the prosecution had presented no evidence to support <PERSON> Moreno </PERSON>'s testimony about the alleged extortion and bribery. `` There is no corroboration of illegal acts.'' After the <PERSON> Vallone </PERSON> payments began, <PERSON> Hirshman </PERSON> said <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> helped <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> obtain a lucrative contract with the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Postal Service, `` something he should have done without getting paid.'' She said their financial problems continued in 1985, so the <PERSON> Garcias </PERSON> returned to `` their local cash machine, the <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'' for a $ 20,000 loan. <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> instructed <PERSON> Moreno </PERSON> to make the check out to his sister, <PERSON> Aimee </PERSON> <PERSON> Cortese </PERSON>, and she transferred the money to Mrs. <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON>'s account, <PERSON> Hirshman </PERSON> said `` If this was a legitimate loan, why is <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Moreno </PERSON> being told to make the check out to <PERSON> Aimee </PERSON> <PERSON> Cortese </PERSON>?'' she asked. Closing arguments will continue through Thursday when <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> <PERSON> Sand </PERSON> will instruct the jury. Deliberations are expected to begin Friday. The <ORGANIZATION> Garcias </ORGANIZATION> have pleaded innocent to charges of conspiracy, extortion, bribery and accepting illegal gratuities. If convicted of the most serious charge, extortion, they would face up to 20 years in prison.

 President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> does not object to Communist parties changing their names and programs, as <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s has done, the Polish party chief said Wednesday after conferring with the Soviet leader <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> `` stressed that the shape and organization of any party depends only on that party,'' <PERSON> Mieczyslaw </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rakowski </PERSON> told a news conference after their 3 -LCB- - hour talk The Hungarian party, which had been losing members and falling in polls, voted Saturday to dissolve itself and form a Western-style socialist organization. <PERSON> Rakowski </PERSON> said that example probably would be followed by the Polish party, which lost its hold on the government in August to a coalition led by the once-banned Solidarity trade union. `` I think our party also must change its program and its name, and I think this will happen at the next party congress,'' <PERSON> Rakowski </PERSON> said. He added that polls show such a change is favored by 70 percent of the members of the <ORGANIZATION> Polish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, as the Communists formally call themselves. Even the Soviet Communist Party could be transformed, but the changes might not mirror those occurring in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, he said. `` Such changes are possible, but will depend on internal forces'' in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Rakowski </PERSON> declared. Of the Soviet leader's attitude toward <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, which plans Western-style economic reforms, he said: `` <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> approved of the policy of our Prime Minister -LRB- <PERSON> Tadeusz </PERSON> -RRB- <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON>. That policy is aimed at putting an end to the critical situation in our country. I am going home satisfied.'' On Wednesday evening, state television broadcast part of a news conference in which <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> told Polish journalists: `` After ups and downs in the history of our relations, we are on the right track: rapprochement and cooperation between our peoples.'' The climate of reform has caused problems for more doctrinaire countries in the Soviet bloc. Tens of thousands of of East Germans fled to the West through <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> to escape the strict regime and hardships in their homeland. <PERSON> Milos </PERSON> <PERSON> Jakes </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Czechoslovak </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, expressed concern Wednesday that recognition of opposition groups in <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> would lend legitimacy to banned organizations that demand change in his country. He told the party <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION>: `` We are not indifferent to what points the way toward destruction of the Socialist system in the friendly countries. We clearly watch these things and draw lessons from them.'' <PERSON> Rakowski </PERSON> repeatedly praised <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, a reformer who is both president of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and head of its <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. `` He is a brilliant counterpart who perfectly understands the fragility of our world,'' he said. `` This has never been the case before.'' By contrast, he said of <PERSON> Karl </PERSON> <PERSON> Marx </PERSON> and <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lenin </PERSON>: `` We should not kneel before the teachings of <PERSON> Lenin </PERSON> and his activities. I am opposed to the religious attitude toward the teachings of <PERSON> Marx </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lenin </PERSON>.'' When asked about the likely new goals of a transformed Polish party, however, <PERSON> Rakowski </PERSON> included a central tenet of communism: `` Even distribution of benefits.'' He said <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> would stay in the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact, which he described as a necessary alliance, but implied the Poles might become neutral eventually. `` I will not forecast what will happen five or 10 years from now,'' he said. `` The coming generation might think differently. Unfortunately, I can not influence their choice.''

 Three teen-agers believed to be members of a street gang were charged Wednesday with severely beating two Jewish students while shouting anti-Semitic slurs at them on the eve of Yom Kippur. Police said the incident was motivated by ethnic hatred, and it again raised concern over social tensions, which were heightened in August when a white gang killed a black young man in the borough of <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION>. Among those arrested Wednesday was the youth who police said they believe triggered the incident, which occurred early Sunday in <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Sorrentino </PERSON>, 18, was charged with assault, riot, aggravated harassment and civil rights violations, police said. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Guben </PERSON>, 16, and <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Hynes </PERSON>, 17, faced assault and civil rights charges. All surrendered after witnesses identified them, Deputy Chief <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> DeMartino </PERSON>, commander of <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION> detectives, said at a news conference. He said the three, all high school students, were believed to be members of a gang called the <ORGANIZATION> Kings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Highway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boys </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> DeMartino </PERSON> said the incident began after <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Weisburg </PERSON> and <PERSON> Joshua </PERSON> <PERSON> Fogel </PERSON>, both 19, left a party at <ORGANIZATION> Brooklyn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Weisburg </PERSON> heard someone speak to him using an ethnic slur and confronted <PERSON> Sorrentino </PERSON>, the deputy chief said. A fight broke out and eight or nine of <PERSON> Sorrentino </PERSON>'s friends jumped in, punching and kicking <PERSON> Weisburg </PERSON> and <PERSON> Fogel </PERSON> and yelling slurs, he said. Police were seeking the other attackers. Police believe <PERSON> Sorrentino </PERSON> instigated the incident, <PERSON> DeMartino </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Sorrentino </PERSON>'s lawyer, <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Aronne </PERSON>, said his client `` only tried to defend himself when grabbed from behind'' and left before the pair were attacked. <PERSON> Weisburg </PERSON> suffered a ruptured spleen and a broken leg; <PERSON> Fogel </PERSON>, a fractured skull. A third Jewish student who tried to break up the fight was roughed up but not hurt seriously. <PERSON> Weisburg </PERSON> was hospitalized in stable condition; <PERSON> Fogel </PERSON> was in good condition.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> Secretary General <PERSON> Manfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Woerner </PERSON> reaffirmed Wednesday a commitment to reaching an agreement with the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact within a year on reducing conventional forces in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Woerner </PERSON>, speaking with reporters after conferring at the White House with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, said, `` I think there is reason for optimism.'' `` Even if it takes more than one year _ if it takes 14 months or 15 months _ I think you can realistically expect an agreement soon,'' said the <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> chief. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Woerner </PERSON> also discussed the dramatic changes in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and the future role of <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>. White House Press Secretary <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said that in addition to reaffirming their commitment to reaching a conventional forces agreement within six to 12 months, the two leaders `` discussed a variety of alliance issues and developments in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> praised <PERSON> Woerner </PERSON>'s leadership at a time when the alliance is charting a new course for <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> and for giving it `` the mission of working to overcome the division of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. It was at the <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> summit in <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION> last May that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> unveiled his proposal for a steep pullback of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet troops from <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Woerner </PERSON>, who also met with Vice President <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, said, `` We are interested in a peaceful evolution, not in unrest, not in upheaval, not in revolution'' in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Woerner </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> must `` be seen as an instrument of the political management of change in East-West relationships'' as well as `` the major source of stability in a time of transition.'' <PERSON> Woerner </PERSON> said he saw no danger of waning public support for <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> as expectations rise for political and economic reforms in the Eastern Bloc. `` We have to explain to our publics that you can only guarantee peace and stability as long as you have this <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>,'' he said. If there were `` unfortunate developments in the East,'' he said, it is `` only as long as <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> exists, only as long as we keep up our guard, -LRB- that -RRB- Soviet politicians know that there is only one way to solve their problems, the peaceful one; that there is no way to go militarily, that there is no chance for military adventures.'' `` We try to support the forces of reform and to support -LRB- Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> -RRB- <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> insofar as he opens up the society, improves the human rights situation and allows self-determination,'' he said. On the demonstrations in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Woerner </PERSON> said, `` we can and will not interfere with their affairs. But as you can see, there is strong pressure from inside towards reform and it must be clear to the leaders of <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> that only if they allow reform to take place this regime will be able to develop peacefully.'' `` If they continue like they do with their tough repression, they will not be able to manage the change,'' he said.

 Lawyers for the <LOCATION> Philippine </LOCATION> government say ousted president <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> and others violated an injunction prohibiting them from disposing of any of their assets, in part to buy arms for an invasion.

Lawyers for the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> requested that a June court order be modified to `` more closely monitor, control and account for the Marcoses' expenditures, transactions, and assets, in order to prevent further violations.''

 Without dissent, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday endorsed legislation authorizing $ 837.5 million in aid to pro-democracy movements in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>. The 35-0 vote, nearly doubling the amount proposed by President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, sends the legislation to the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> floor for action next week. Some Republican members said they were concerned about the spending levels authorized by the bill. But most members of the panel said the legislation is an appropriate and urgently needed response to democratic and free-market trends in both Eastern European nations. `` Success with our help is uncertain, but failure without our assistance is guaranteed,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON>, D-Ind., moments before the bill was approved The House bill includes the $ 200 million in aid to help <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> stabilize its currency that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> proposed last week. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration took no position on the bill, which would authorize spending $ 837.5 million to aid <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> over the next three years _ $ 284 million of that in the fiscal year that began Oct. 1. The lion's share of the aid would go to the more populous and economically troubled <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. A <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> proposal under consideration in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> calls for making $ 1.25 billion available to help <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> shift to a free-market economy and build Democratic institutions. The administration has proposed spending $ 455.5 million over the three-year period. <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON> said the House bill addresses an `` extraordinarily unique'' opportunity to wean Eastern <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> away from communism with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> playing a leading role. `` This is an opportunity that may not come again for a long, long time and I think we should grab it and run,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lagomarsino </PERSON>, R-Calif. The chairman, Rep. <PERSON> Dante </PERSON> <PERSON> Fascell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Fla </LOCATION>., said the aid would `` lessen the impact of the instability which must take place when you think of the enormity of the changes'' <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> will have to make to transform their state-run economies `` I can only say that after four decades in which we spent literally trillions of dollars to prevent the communization of <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, this is a relatively modest amount to promote the unravelling of comminism in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>; it is a very small price to pay,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Solarz </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N </LOCATION>. Although several Republicans said they had problems with the levels of spending, only Rep. <PERSON> Toby </PERSON> <PERSON> Roth </PERSON>, R-Wis., said he was opposed to the entire concept of the bill <PERSON> Roth </PERSON> contended the legislation does not adequately spell out how the money would be spent and represents `` an attempt to solve the problem by throwing money at it.'' <PERSON> Roth </PERSON> was not present for the roll call vote.

Defense Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> identified it as a MiG-23 MLD _ `` one of the most advanced versions of the MiG-23 supplied to the Syrians after 1982.'' Asked if information obtained from the aircraft would be shared with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, he said: `` We can assume so.'' <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> are archenemies and have been in a state of war since the Jewish state was created in 1948. A Syrian official in <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION> said the pilot did not defect, but ran into mechanical problems and made an emergency landing. <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> asked the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> to assist in his return. It was the first time a Syrian flyer was reported to have defected to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, although <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> forces have seized other Syrian planes and received defectors from other Arab countries. `` This morning a <LOCATION> Syrian </LOCATION> pilot escaped from <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> with his plane, a MiG-23, and he landed safely in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>,'' said Col. <PERSON> Raanan </PERSON> <PERSON> Gissin </PERSON>, an army spokesman. `` He defected to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and that's a fact,'' <PERSON> Gissin </PERSON> said, adding it appeared to be `` for personal reasons.'' <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio said the pilot asked for asylum. An army spokesman said no decision on that had been announced, adding: `` At this point we have nothing official to say. We're talking with him to see what he wants.'' The aircraft was `` detected by the Israeli air force and landed here,'' <PERSON> Gissin </PERSON> said. He refused to say if Israeli aircraft escorted the Syrian plane or if it penetrated sophisticated air defenses as it crossed the <LOCATION> Golan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Heights </LOCATION>, captured by <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> in the 1967 <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> war. The pilot, identified as Maj. <PERSON> Adel </PERSON> <PERSON> Basem </PERSON>, a 34-year-old bachelor, landed about 11:15 a.m. at an airfield used by crop-dusting planes at <LOCATION> Megiddo </LOCATION>, 57 miles north of <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, an army communique said. There was a companion jet but an army spokesman said as far as <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> can tell, the second jet returned to <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>. A witness named <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Mizrahi </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION> he did not realize the plane was Syrian because he saw no Israeli escort planes. `` If there were accompanying planes I would have known it was being brought down,'' he said. `` I thought it was a disguised plane or something.'' <PERSON> Mizrahi </PERSON> said an armed civilian drove a white <ORGANIZATION> Peugeot </ORGANIZATION> into the airfield and confronted the Syrian flyer. The radio quoted other witnesses as saying the pilot raised his hands and said, `` I have no intentions of war.'' <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> and armed forces chief of staff Lt. Gen. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Shomron </PERSON> flew in by helicopter to meet the pilot. <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> was asked three times in an interview on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> TV how the jet eluded Israeli border defenses, but would say only, `` All this is being checked now.'' The Syrian official in <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION>, who spoke on condition of anonymnity, said the pilot had to land after the plane `` faced a technical failure.'' Other Syrian sources said smoke poured from the aircraft's engine. <PERSON> Gissin </PERSON>, addressing reporters in front of the needle-nosed Syrian aircraft, declared, `` I can categorically say there were no technical malfunctions. It was in perfect condition when it landed.'' The aircraft, painted in a camouflage pattern of brown, beige and green, was illuminated by a spotlight. Its cockpit bubble was up. There was no outward sign the plane had caught fire. <PERSON> Gissin </PERSON> said the aircraft carried no ammunition or armaments except two 23mm machine guns mounted near the cockpit. He said the advanced MiG-23 would be useful to both <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and its allies. The craft, originally developed in 1967, was believed last updated in 1985. The MiG-23 is a single-seat, swing-wing fighter bomber. It has a range of 530 miles and can carry up to 17,000 pounds in bombs and missiles. It is a mainstay of <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>'s air force, though <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION> also has the Soviet's most advanced craft, the MiG-29. <PERSON> Nick </PERSON> <PERSON> Cook </PERSON>, aviation editor of the <ORGANIZATION> Jane </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weekly </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is believed to have at least four MiG-23s, obtained through <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>, and uses them to train airmen for dogfights. Brig. Gen. <PERSON> Oded </PERSON> <PERSON> Erez </PERSON>, a former head of air force intelligence, told <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> much could be learned from having <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s pilots fly the craft and much also could be learned from the pilot On Aug. 12, 1968, two Syrian pilots landed MiG-17s in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> because of navigational error. They were exchanged for Israeli war prisoners in 1973, but their planes were not returned. Two Arab pilots defected to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> in the past. Iraqi pilot <PERSON> Munir </PERSON> <PERSON> Redfa </PERSON> landed in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> in a MiG-21 on Aug. 16, 1966, and Egyptian Hilme <PERSON> Mahmoud </PERSON> <PERSON> Abbas </PERSON> flew a Soviet-built Yak-11 training plane into the country Jan. 19, 1964.

 The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday applauded South African government plans to release eight anti-apartheid prisoners and urged `` the release of all political prisoners, including <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>.'' <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> had long regarded the freeing of political prisoners as an important step to promote talks between the South African government and the non-white majority in the country. Ms. <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government also welcomed President F.W. <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON>'s meeting Wedneday with Archbishop <PERSON> Desmond </PERSON> <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON>, the Rev. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Boesak </PERSON>, and the Rev. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Chikane </PERSON>. <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON> did not say when the prisoners would be released. `` We are encouraged by these positive moves, and hope that they are merely the first steps in a process which will see the release of all political prisoners, including <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>, and the return of political exiles, lifting of the state of emergency and associated restrictions on political activity, and negotiations on a peaceful transition to a nonracial and democratic <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>,'' Ms. <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON> said.

She was asked whether <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> had given <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> any idea of when <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> might be released. `` If he did, Secretary <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> did not impart that to me,'' Ms. <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON> said, adding that she did n't know whether <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> planned any further meetings with South African officials. <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> is the best-known imprisoned leader of the outlawed <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. Ms. <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON> said she was unable to say whether the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government would drop some sanctions against <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> as a result of the freeing of the prisoners.

 <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Dickinson </PERSON> said Wednesday he did not violate <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> ethics rules when he accepted a one-third interest in a $ 300,000 investment venture from a businessman whose companies have done $ 50 million in government defense work in the past two years. <PERSON> Dickinson </PERSON>, the ranking Republican on the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said there was `` nothing illegal, immoral or unethical about'' his joining with industrialist <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Collier </PERSON> to form the <ORGANIZATION> Montgomery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> in 1986. <PERSON> Dickinson </PERSON> said he approached <PERSON> Collier </PERSON> with `` what I thought was a good business opportunity'' and <PERSON> Collier </PERSON> agreed to put $ 300,000 into the joint venture. The agreement provided that any profits or losses would be shared one-third by <PERSON> Dickinson </PERSON> and two-thirds by <PERSON> Collier </PERSON>. Asked what he put into the venture, <PERSON> Dickinson </PERSON> replied, `` I had the contacts.'' House rules prohibit members from accepting gifts of more than $ 100 from any individual who has a direct interest in legislation before <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> ethics committee has said the rule applies to any individual who has a special interest `` in influencing or affecting the federal legislative process which sets'' him apart from the general public. `` If he's got a direct interest in legislation I do n't know what it is,'' <PERSON> Dickinson </PERSON> said of <PERSON> Collier </PERSON>. `` He's never asked me to vote any way, I do n't know of any legislation he's interested in and that's as far as it goes.'' <PERSON> Collier </PERSON> owns 45 percent of <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Apparel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, which was formed in 1987 after <PERSON> Collier </PERSON> and several associates purchased the assets of the bankrupt <ORGANIZATION> Selma </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Apparel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co </ORGANIZATION>. The firm now has three plants in <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>, and according to <PERSON> Rick </PERSON> <PERSON> Cippele </PERSON>, a part owner of the company, has received $ 48.6 million in uniform contracts awarded by the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Logistics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> after competitive bidding. <PERSON> Collier </PERSON> also owns half interest in <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Microsystems </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> Montgomery </LOCATION> company that manufactures electronics components and test equipment for the aerospace, automobile and appliance industries. <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Chesnutt </PERSON>, director of public affairs for <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Microsystems </ORGANIZATION>, said $ 3 million of the company's $ 9 million in total revenue this year came from subcontracts with two major defense contractors, <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technologies </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> GTE </ORGANIZATION> Government Systems. <PERSON> Dickinson </PERSON> said he has promoted <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Microsystems </ORGANIZATION> among defense contractors, just as he has promoted other businesses in his district that are interested in defense subcontracting work.

 A merchant ship carrying a crew of 12 capsized in the Arabian Sea off <LOCATION> Oman </LOCATION> late Wednesday, and a British destroyer rescued 10 in the dark but two men remain missing, the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> said. The 500-ton <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Mawarid </PERSON> was bound from <LOCATION> Dubai </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Aden </LOCATION> with a load of timber when it overturned, a ministry spokesman said. The ministry initially said it sank when the cargo shifted suddenly, but the spokesman later said the circumstances were unclear. The <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> destroyer HMS <LOCATION> Manchester </LOCATION> continued searching through the night for the two missing crew, who are believed trapped in the upturned hull, said the spokesman, who by custom was not identified. The rescued included the vessel's captain and first officer, who were not identified. The survivors were believed to include four Iranians and crew from <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oman </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Dubai </LOCATION>, the spokesman said. The officer of the watch on the <LOCATION> Manchester </LOCATION>, which was en route to the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>, spotted wreckage and survivors in the water about 17 miles east of <LOCATION> Ras </LOCATION> <LOCATION> al </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hadd </LOCATION> off <LOCATION> Oman </LOCATION>, the spokesman said. Six crew scrambled up nets thrown over the side of the <LOCATION> Manchester </LOCATION> and two spotted clinging to chunks of wood were recovered shortly afterwards, the spokesman said. A boat was launched to search the immediate vicinity and the captain scrambled <ORGANIZATION> Manchester </ORGANIZATION>'s Lynx helicopter to search further afield while the medical officer provided first aid to the survivors, the spokesman said. <ORGANIZATION> Lloyd </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shipping </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said it had no reports of the capsizing and no information on a vessel named <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Mawarid </PERSON>.

 The constitutional rights of white defendants are violated if prosecutors keep blacks off juries, the lawyer for a white man convicted of rape argued Wednesday before the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> Cook </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, public defender <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Honchell </PERSON> wants the court to order a new trial for <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Holland </PERSON> and to give him the authority to object to the removal of prospective black jurors. <PERSON> Honchell </PERSON> faced tough questions from Justices <PERSON> Antonin </PERSON> <PERSON> Scalia </PERSON> and <PERSON> Byron </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON>, who said only the pool of jurors should be representive of the community _ not the jury itself. `` You're driving up hill in this case,'' <PERSON> White </PERSON> said. Prosecutors, without explanation, may reject 12 prospective jurors by using peremptory challenges. The defense also has 12 peremptory challenges. In <LOCATION> Holland </LOCATION>'s case, two challenges were used to remove two blacks, though prosecutors said the disqualifications were n't racially motivated `` It's a level playing field,'' <PERSON> Scalia </PERSON> said of the jury selection process. `` Each side gets their peremptories. Why is n't that a perfectly rational system? `` This court,'' <PERSON> Honchell </PERSON> said, `` can utilize the Sixth Amendment to say white defendants have a right to complain.'' The Sixth Amendment guarantees the right to a fair trial. An all-white <LOCATION> Cook </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> jury convicted <LOCATION> Holland </LOCATION> in 1981 of rape, sexual assault, armed robbery and kidnapping. Five years later, in a case involving a black defendant and black jurors, the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> barred prosecutors from disqualifying potential jurors based on race. <PERSON> Holland </PERSON> took his case to the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> after the <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> said a white man lacks the legal standing to challenge the exclusion of blacks from a jury. <ORGANIZATION> Cook </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assistant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION>'s Attorney <PERSON> Inge </PERSON> <PERSON> Fryklund </PERSON> argued that decision by the state court should stand. `` <PERSON> Petitioner </PERSON> <PERSON> Holland </PERSON> got exactly what the Sixth Amendment provides,'' she said. The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> will issue an opinion next year. The <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advancement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Colored </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Legal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> and Education Fund support <LOCATION> Holland </LOCATION>. In a brief filed with the court, the groups cited a 1975 <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruling that upheld a male defendant's right to challenge the exclusion of female jurors. On May 4, 1980, <PERSON> Holland </PERSON> offered a ride to a 17-year-old girl and her boyfriend _ both white _ after the couple's car had two flat tires. <PERSON> Holland </PERSON> then pulled a knife and told the boy to get out. He raped the girl, forced her to perform oral sex and stole $ 60 before leaving her in an alley. He was sentenced to 85 years in prison.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> has suspended a grain company from participating in a farm export program because of the company's ties to a fugitive commodities trader in <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>. The company, <ORGANIZATION> Richco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Grain </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>, has received $ 95 million worth of government-owned grain as subsidies under the Export Enhancement Program since 1986. <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> temporarily suspended the company effective Sept. 29 because of its connections to <PERSON> Marc </PERSON> <PERSON> Rich </PERSON> and a Rich associate, <ORGANIZATION> Pincus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Green </ORGANIZATION>. Both fled to <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION> in 1983 before their indictment for criminal tax evasion, racketeering, mail and wire fraud. <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> <PERSON> Shipp </PERSON>, a spokesman for Agriculture Secretary <PERSON> Clayton </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON>, said Wednesday there was `` cause for concern'' about the involvement as <PERSON> Rich </PERSON> and <PERSON> Green </PERSON> as company stockholders and that the agency's inspector general was continuing to investigate. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomajan </PERSON>, an attorney for <ORGANIZATION> Richco </ORGANIZATION>, said the company would appeal the <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> action. He declined to comment on the extent of <PERSON> Rich </PERSON>'s control over the company but maintained it was not an adequate reason for the suspension by <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION>. He said <PERSON> Richco </PERSON> had `` performed admirably'' in the export program. The department began investigating the company earlier this year at the request of Rep. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Glickman </PERSON>, D-Kan., the chairman of a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee that oversees the farm export program <PERSON> Glickman </PERSON> contended <ORGANIZATION> Richco </ORGANIZATION>, a Swiss-based company, should not qualify for taxpayer-financed subsidies through <ORGANIZATION> EEP </ORGANIZATION> because <PERSON> Rich </PERSON> appeared to exert control over <ORGANIZATION> Richco </ORGANIZATION> and share in its profits. <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION>, according to <PERSON> Glickman </PERSON>, determined that <PERSON> Rich </PERSON> and <PERSON> Green </PERSON>, who also lives in <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION> and faces charges in the tax evasion case, hold more than 51 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Richco </ORGANIZATION>'s stock. `` He is getting a gratuity from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> in participating in this program,'' said <PERSON> Glickman </PERSON>. `` It's unbelievable that the program could be operated so loosely.'' Under the program, private exporters can sell <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> commodities at lower prices to meet foreign competition and then collect free government grain or other commodities as bonuses, or subsidies. The commodity bonuses are designed to go to foreign buyers to help sweeten the deals and counter what <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> farm groups consider unfair trading practices by overseas competitors, particularly the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION>. There have been more than $ 8 billion in farm sales through <ORGANIZATION> EEP </ORGANIZATION>, which was established by the 1985 farm law. At the end of July, subsidies valued at nearly $ 2.6 billion had been provided through the program. Although pleased that <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> acted against <ORGANIZATION> Richco </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Glickman </PERSON> criticized the agency for moving too slowly. `` Obviously this is a very embarrassing situation to the department but I still do n't know to this day why it took them five months to do this,'' said <PERSON> Glickman </PERSON>. According to <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Richco </ORGANIZATION> has received <ORGANIZATION> EEP </ORGANIZATION> subsidies valued at $ 95 million, mostly barley and wheat for sales to <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>. Most recently, <ORGANIZATION> Richco </ORGANIZATION> picked up subsidies estimated at $ 277,000 for a wheat sale in May to the Soviets. Earlier this year, <ORGANIZATION> Richco </ORGANIZATION> ranked ninth among grain exporters in amounts of <ORGANIZATION> EEP </ORGANIZATION> subsidies. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> authorities have been unable to extradite <PERSON> Rich </PERSON> from <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>. The government alleges that <PERSON> Rich </PERSON> and his commodity-trading empire cheated the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> out of millions of dollars in taxes through a series of illegal oil transactions among Rich-controlled companies. Forbes magazine has identified <PERSON> Rich </PERSON> and <PERSON> Green </PERSON> as among the nation's wealthiest people, with each having an estimated net worth of $ 775 million.

 The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> agreed Wednesday to allow federally paid abortions for poor women who are victims of rape or incest, reversing nearly a decade of more restrictive votes and inviting a veto from President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. By a 216-206 vote, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> rejected the language it has kept in the law since 1981 and instead endorsed a more liberal provision already passed by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. An effort by conservatives to reverse the vote then failed, 212-207. Federal aid for abortions, available under Medicaid, is now limited to poor women whose lives have been endangered by a pregnancy. Wednesday's vote came three months after a <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruling giving states greater powers to restrict abortions. Lawmakers and activists who say women have a right to an abortion said the ruling spurred supporters of their position to make their views known to their legislators. Opponents agreed. `` The political momentum on this issue is so strong now that if President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> vetoes this, he'd be making a big mistake,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Boxer </PERSON>, D-Calif., who led the fight for the eased limitations Rep. <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Hyde </PERSON>, R-Ill., who has led the anti-abortion fight in the House for years, said, `` I could n't characterize it any other way than as a defeat for the unborn I was surprised, upset and disappointed.'' House members without strong positions `` felt they had the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> to protect them'' until the July ruling, said Rep. <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> Kildee </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Mich </LOCATION>. and a supporter of tougher restrictions Now, however, `` it's no longer a vote cast in a vacuum. It's a vote with real consequences,'' he said. The provision agreed to by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> would allow Medicaid payments for abortions when the mother's life is in jeopardy or when the pregnancy resulted from a rape or incest that was `` promptly'' reported to authorities. Since 1981 _ and as recently as Aug. 2 _ the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> has voted for language limiting federal aid to abortions only in cases in which the woman's life was in danger. Just a year ago, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> caved to the restrictive House position on Medicaid abortion financing by a vote of 47-43. The abortion provision is part of a $ 156.7 billion measure to finance labor, health and education programs for fiscal 1990, which began Oct. 1. The spending bill, which was approved 364-56, now moves to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> threatened in August to veto the bill if it contains the more liberal abortion language. Administration officials reiterated that threat Wednesday. The president's senior advisers would recommend a veto if <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> sent him a bill that would pay `` for abortions in cases beyond when the life of the monther is endangered,'' said <PERSON> Alixe </PERSON> <PERSON> Glen </PERSON>, a White House spokeswoman. Vice President <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, answering a reporter's question during a photo session, said, `` There is no retrenchment at all by the president on this very important issue. ...'' Just one disagreement remains to be settled between the two chambers before the legislation goes to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> _ whether to accept a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> proposal to ban federal aid to programs that buy hypodermic needles for intravenous drug users unless the president certifies that the effort helps prevent the spread of AIDS. The bill also contains more than $ 1.5 billion for AIDS research and treatment; $ 4 billion for job-training programs; $ 1.9 billion for alcohol, drug abuse and mental health programs; $ 11.7 billion for welfare programs, and $ 2.1 billion for education for the handicapped. The vote was the second abortion showdown in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> since the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>'s July 3 decision in the Webster vs. Reproductive Health Services case. On Aug. 2, the chamber voted to dramatically liberalize abortion restrictions in the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>. That was the first time since 1980 that the chamber had rejected tighter limits. The August vote was considered less politically risky than Wednesday's because it affected only residents of the nation's capital, leaving unchanged federal laws that affect the whole country As have countless congressional debates on abortion, Wednesday's fight was raged over the rights of the mother and the rights of the fetus `` Rape and incest is a tragedy. Nobody says it is n't,'' said <PERSON> Hyde </PERSON>. `` But why visit on the second victim, the unborn child that is the product of that criminal act, capital punishment?'' <PERSON> Boxer </PERSON> countered, `` For the sake of human compassion, at least allow the females of this nation to decide for themselves along with their God'' whether they will undergo an abortion, At several points, the debate took a personal turn. `` I'm a psychiatrist and a physician who has treated victims of both rape and incest,'' said Rep. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> McDermott </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Wash </LOCATION>. `` I must tell you the last thing victims of assault need is to have control over their own bodies taken away from them yet again by the government. Rep. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Lightfoot </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Iowa </LOCATION>, spoke against liberalizing the Medicaid constraints, saying he spoke for `` the children who possibly were the result of an inconvenience, rape, incest, or maybe a good time in the back seat of a Chevrolet. I happen to be one of those. I have no idea why I was conceived or what happened.'' In a letter sent to lawmakers and dated Tuesday, <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> said the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration opposes easing restrictions on Medicaid-financed abortions `` for both philosophical and administrative reasons.'' <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> said it would be difficult to write regulations to determine when rape or incest has occurred. Medicaid financing for poor women's abortions has been restricted in one way or another since 1977. In 1979, the last year for which reliable figures are available, there were 72 federally subsidized abortions in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, according to the private <ORGANIZATION> Alan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guttmacher </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>. In fiscal 1987 _ the most recent statistics available _ the federal government paid for 322 abortions at a cost of $ 160,000, the institute says. States financed 189,000 abortions that same year. There are an estimated 1.6 million abortions performed legally in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> each year.

 Communist leaders in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> have little choice but to make reforms such as those occurring the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, two top West German officials said Wednesday. `` It's inconceivable that ... -LRB- <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> -RRB- will stay as it is'' in view of changes in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, West German Defense Minister <PERSON> Gerhard </PERSON> <PERSON> Stoltenberg </PERSON> told reporters. <PERSON> Stoltenberg </PERSON>, who met Tuesday with President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, and <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> Secretary-General <PERSON> Manfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Woerner </PERSON>, a former West German defense minister who visited <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on Wednesday, spoke at separate news conferences. `` The major disagreeable thing for them is that if they continue like they do, their tough repression, they will not be able to manage the change, they will not be able to peacefully develop their countries,'' <PERSON> Woerner </PERSON> said about <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. `` They get more and more isolated, and I think that is reason enough to change.'' <PERSON> Stoltenberg </PERSON> said the repression used by <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> to crush its student democracy movement was n't `` a real alternative'' for <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. `` But if they do n't take the <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> example, they have to move in the other direction,'' he said. `` Otherwise, the economic and political situation will deteriorate because people have no motivation for work and have no motivation to participate under the existing patterns.'' <PERSON> Stoltenberg </PERSON> said earlier that <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s attempts to urge reforms on <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> have been weakened because of his own problems at home. `` <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s influence in the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact countries is not as great as ... -LRB- the Soviet leader's -RRB- was five years ago because he has more and more domestic difficulties,'' he said. `` He has influence, but not, I think, to the same extent as ... his predecessors had.'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> leader visited <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> last week, expressing confidence in <PERSON> Erich </PERSON> <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON>'s ruling <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. However, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> urged <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON>'s government to work with `` all forces in society'' to tackle problems facing <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON> indicated he would continue his hard-line approach and not follow the reforms adopted in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>. There have been mixed signals from the East German government since <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s visit, with some calls for reform, as the country grapples with how to staunch the flow of refugees to the West. More than 100,000 people have left <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> this year, many in recent weeks. `` We do not know what <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said to <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON> when he was there, because they had a closed session, of course,'' <PERSON> Stoltenberg </PERSON> said. `` But from some remarks some of his close officials made to West German counterparts in private conversations, we think that he advised them to do some reform steps.'' <PERSON> Stoltenberg </PERSON>, who arrived here Monday, has met with Vice President <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> and Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>. He will visit <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and German forces at military bases in <LOCATION> Norfolk </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> before returning to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> on Friday.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> will send a highly mobile border patrol force to <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> as part of the regional peace agreement signed in August, says a report by Secretary-General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON>. A copy of the report to the <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, obtained by The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday, shows the peacekeeping force will be equipped with jeeps, helicopters and speedboats. The mission is to involve 625 people, including civilian support personnel. Its job is to prevent any nation from mounting an attack on a neighbor, to verify that no rebel forces cross borders to launch raids and to halt radio or television TV broadcasts by insurrectionists. The presidents of <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION> requested the force in a letter to Perez de Cuellar in March. Personnel from <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> and a group of Latin American nations are to join the operation. It must be approved by the <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, but council members have indicated support for such a force, to be called ONUCA to reflect the Spanish name for the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>. ONUCA will be the first major <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> peacekeeping effort in the <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hemisphere </LOCATION>. A two-man observer group was stationed in the <LOCATION> Dominican </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> in 1965-66 to monitor a truce between two military factions vying for control of the government. The mission will include 260 military observers, 115 crew for 12 helicopters and an airplane, 50 men to operate speedboats and patrol boats, a 14-member medical staff, 104 <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> administrators and 82 locally hired civilians. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s contribution is not yet clear. Its constitution prohibits sending soldiers abroad, except to support <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>, but it could contribute members of the border police, pilots and support personnel. Headquarters will be in <LOCATION> Tegucigalpa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>, with liaison offices in the other four Central American capitals and 31 `` verification centers'' staffed by observers. The naval unit, to be based at <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, will patrol the Gulf of <PERSON> Fonseca </PERSON>, coastal areas and rivers. No estimate of the operation's cost was given in the report. In a separate report released Wednesday, <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> said another <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> force would be needed to collect weapons from the Contras, Nicaraguan rebels based in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> who are being disbanded, and assist in their repatriation or relocation to another country. <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> election monitors also have gone to <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> to verify that national elections scheduled for Feb. 25 are conducted fairly by the leftist Sandinista government.

 <LOCATION> NEW </LOCATION> <LOCATION> YORK </LOCATION> _ A committee of <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> bishops Wednesday criticized alleged Israeli human rights abuses in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>, and called for Palestinians to be included as equal partners in negotiations for a sovereign Palestinian homeland. The draft statement by the Ad <ORGANIZATION> Hoc </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> on the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> praised the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for opening discussions with the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, and asked the administration to take a more active role in negotiating a peace in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> that meets the security needs of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and the `` long-denied rights'' of Palestinians. `` It is our conviction that a truly open moment for peace exists in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, and that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has an indispensable role to play in the peace process which has moved us to write this statement,'' said the committee, made up of Archbishop <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahony </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, Cardinal <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and Bishop <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Keeler </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION>. The statement, `` Toward Peace in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>: Problems and Principles,'' will be presented to the nation's 300 bishops at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bishops </ORGANIZATION>' fall meeting Nov. 6-9 in <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION>. Some <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Jewish leaders welcomed the bishops' support for <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, but said they were troubled by parts of the statement, including what they said was the bishops' premature support for a sovereign Palestinian homeland. The bishops also failed to give equal weight `` to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s very real problems and legitimate rights in maintaining order in the territories,'' and a 40-year history of terrorist attacks by Palestinians, said <PERSON> Rabbi </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Rudin </PERSON>, national interreligious affairs director of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jewish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, and <PERSON> Judith </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Banki </PERSON>, his associate. An <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> leader applauded the bishops' draft document. `` The addition of such a respected moral voice on the side of Palestinian independence is an historic development at a critial juncture in the <LOCATION> Palestinian-Israeli </LOCATION> conflict,'' said <PERSON> Abdeen </PERSON> <PERSON> Jabara </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> American-Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Anti-Discrimination </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. `` History will record that the moral authority of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> was indisputably on the side of peace in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>.'' The bishops said the statement was devised after consultations with the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION>, religious leaders in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policymakers on the region and major Jewish, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> and Christian organizations. All the groups the bishops met with were `` very, very grateful for the role of the <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> bishops,'' said <PERSON> Mahony </PERSON>, the committee chairman who described the prelates' role as one of being instruments of peace. `` We see this as a moral challenge. There is a better way to live,'' he said. The intefadeh, the rebellion by Palestinians in the Israeli-occupied territories of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> since 1987, has recast the policy agenda in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> by bringing <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> claims to the forefront, the bishops said. The uprising is a `` cry for justice'' and `` personal and political identity'' that demands `` on both moral and political grounds, a response by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> government,'' the bishops wrote. The bishops cited several alleged Israeli human rights abuses in the occupied territories, including beating deaths of Palestinians and people not involved in demonstrations, the demolition of homes and arrest and detention without trial. American support for <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> is basically a sound policy, the bishops' committee said, but it does not conflict with concern for human rights. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> also must go beyond the approach taken in the Camp David accords of the 1970s, which gave Palestinians a secondary role in the peace process, and grant `` their right to participate as equals, through representatives selected by Palestinians, in all negotiations affecting their destiny,'' the bishops said. Having opened political discussions with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> in December 1988, `` the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> now has the opportunity to use its influence and relationships to foster a more extensive dialogue among <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Palestinians </LOCATION> and the <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> states,'' the bishops wrote. The bishops also called upon the Arab states and Palestinians to recognize <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s right to exist. `` The time is long since past when this basic element of international life should be affirmed for <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>,'' the committee said. The bishops specifically asked the Arab nations to establish full diplomatic relations with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, and for all nations involved in the peace process to pressure <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> to withdraw from <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. One <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Jewish leader said the statement is worthy of discussion, but its credibility is undermined by a failure to call upon the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> to establish full diplomatic relations with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. `` It is incongruous of them to ask the Arab states to establish such diplomatic relations while not asking the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION>, the seat of the <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>, to do so,'' said <PERSON> Elan </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jewish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Mahony </PERSON> said the issue of <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> relations with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> was not `` in our jurisdiction or our competence.''

 Fans generally were enthusiastic about the world premiere of `` Holy Blood and <ORGANIZATION> Crescent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Moon </ORGANIZATION>,'' an opera by <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON> <PERSON> Copeland </PERSON>, former drummer of the rock group Police. But a newspaper music critic panned it. `` Music is the heart and soul of opera, and <PERSON> Copeland </PERSON>'s score rises only at a few isolated moments to anything that makes us care about his characters,'' <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Finn </PERSON> of The -LRB- <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION> -RRB- Plain Dealer said in a review published Wednesday. `` It is full of nervous orchestral busy-work. `` We are left here with a well-intentioned but essentially amateurish work.'' <PERSON> Finn </PERSON> added: `` Give the young pop composer credit for not making some sort of pop-oriented opera out of his subject. He has tried for something serious and genuine.'' The curtain had to be held for 15 minutes Tuesday night while hundreds of last-minute ticket buyers found their seats. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Bamberger </PERSON>, general manager of the <ORGANIZATION> Cleveland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Opera </ORGANIZATION>, said more tickets were sold for <PERSON> Copeland </PERSON>'s opera than any other grand opera the company has produced. For spectator <PERSON> Brent </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, 22, of <LOCATION> Painesville </LOCATION>, the idea of a rock star moving into the tradition-laden world of grand opera is exciting. `` He's bringing new ideas to high opera,'' said <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, in dinner jacket and red bow tie. <PERSON> Copeland </PERSON>, who spent six years with the <ORGANIZATION> rock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> and has scored movies and television shows, took four years to write the opera, a tale of the Crusades in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Opera </LOCATION> officials said it is the first time a major figure from popular music has written an opera since <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Gershwin </PERSON> wrote `` Porgy and <PERSON> Bess </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Copeland </PERSON>, 37, decided to write an opera on a lark in 1984, when he wrote music for a ballet for <PERSON> Shakespeare </PERSON>'s `` King Lear'' for the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ballet </LOCATION>. He said he would write another ballet `` after I finish my opera.'' <PERSON> Bamberger </PERSON>'s son, <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON>, heard the remark and urged his father to contact <PERSON> Copeland </PERSON>. `` Holy Blood and Crescent Moon'' will be performed again Thursday through Sunday at the State Theater and in March 1991 in <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. Producers from several opera companies across the country were invited to the <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION> performances.

 The committee that awarded the Nobel Prize for medicine to two American scientists should have recognized the contributions made by a <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> researcher, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>'s minister for research and technology said Wednesday. `` I share the deep regret of not having seen the name of Professor -LRB- <PERSON> Dominique </PERSON> -RRB- <PERSON> Stehelin </PERSON> attached to the Nobel Prize for medicine,'' <PERSON> Henri </PERSON> <PERSON> Curien </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> in response to a lawmaker's question. <PERSON> Stehelin </PERSON> was the principal signer of the first article in the scientific magazine Nature in 1976 on the discovery of the cellular gene which is at the origin of cancer.

 The discovery of a key engine part from a jumbo jet that crashed in July intensifies the search of <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> cornfields for other pieces to the puzzle of what caused the DC-10's rear engine to fly apart, officials said Wednesday. `` We do n't know yet whether this is the golden nugget we're looking for,'' said <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Burnett </PERSON>, a member of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> `` But we're glad we found it.'' Officials of <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, which made the engine in 1972, said the discovery of the fan disk of the crippled DC-10 that crashed July 19 while trying to land at the <LOCATION> Sioux </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> airport is important to the investigation into what happened to <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> Flight 232. `` This is the key to the whole search,'' said <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON>, a flight safety investigator for GE. <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> spoke at the Storm Lake airport before the fan disk was flown to <ORGANIZATION> GE </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Evendale </LOCATION> jet engine plant in suburban <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION>, where it arrived later in the day. <ORGANIZATION> GE </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Rick </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> said federal inspectors went to the plant to oversee inspection of the part. One hundred searchers hired by <ORGANIZATION> GE </ORGANIZATION> will walk newly harvested fields in northwest <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> this weekend. Flight 232 crashed while trying to land at the <LOCATION> Sioux </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gateway </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> after its aft engine disintegrated in flight, throwing parts that severed all the plane's hydraulic lines. The jumbo jet cartwheeled across the runway in a fiery crash that killed 112 people; 184 people survived. Farmers have been recovering small pieces of the No. 2 engine for several weeks, but investigators said the key to what happened is apparently the 290-pound titanium disk that holds fan blades. But on Tuesday <PERSON> Janice </PERSON> <PERSON> Sorenson </PERSON> was running a combine through corn a half-mile from her house on her farm about 10 miles north of <LOCATION> Alta </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Alta </LOCATION> is about 80 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Des </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Moines </LOCATION>. `` I felt a resistance against the combine, so I backed up, and I looked and I could see the fan blades protruding from the ground,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Sorenson </PERSON> said. She said the disk `` was buried between 6 and 8 inches. It was all in one piece but there were pieces of fan blades that had been broken off.'' What she had found was about two-thirds of the fan disk assembly, which looks like a windmill. <PERSON> Burnett </PERSON> said it is too early to assume that a flaw in the disk caused the crash. `` The metallurgical examination of the disk itself, if in fact the problem originated there, should in fact reveal the cause,'' <PERSON> Burnett </PERSON> said. `` Hopefully, it is something that will answer a lot of technical questions and might do so in short order,'' he said. It is unlikely, he said, that the <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION> will reveal results of tests before a hearing that begins Oct. 30 in <LOCATION> Sioux </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Evandale </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> GE </ORGANIZATION> plant spokesman <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Lane </PERSON> would not theorize about what might have gone wrong with the disk, which probably was made in the early 1970s, but said <ORGANIZATION> GE </ORGANIZATION> was eager to see the part. `` This is a very significant find, in our eyes,'' he said. Mrs. <PERSON> Sorenson </PERSON>, 58, said she knew immediately what the piece was because <ORGANIZATION> GE </ORGANIZATION> had distributed pictures to farmers. `` I was shocked and I was very happy for GE because they put a lot of time in it,'' she said. `` Hopefully it will solve some of the problems they've been looking for.'' GE lawyer <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Gadd </PERSON> said Mrs. <PERSON> Sorenson </PERSON> will receive a portion of the $ 50,000 reward it offered for the disk equal to the percentage of the disk she recovered, plus separate rewards for each fan blade. The company is paying up to $ 1,000 each for recovered blades. <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> said he hopes the weekend search will yield results now that fields no longer have 10-foot stands of corn. `` A lot of important parts are still missing and are out there somewhere,'' he said, including 16 of 20 bolts that held the disk to the engine.

 The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Border </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Patrol </ORGANIZATION> is trying to determine if a smuggler of illegal aliens locked four men in a trailer on a railroad car where they were killed by a pesticide used to fumigate the trailer, agents said Wednesday. Autopsies showed the four men found in the trailer and a fifth found along the railroad tracks 60 miles away were killed by the pesticide, officials said Wednesday. Border Patrol agents suspect the men were locked in the trailer by smugglers in <LOCATION> Harlingen </LOCATION>, where the train left Monday night for <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>. `` At this point, that appears to be the case, although we're not ready to issue a complete report on that,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Border </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Patrol </ORGANIZATION> Chief <PERSON> Silvestre </PERSON> <PERSON> Reyes </PERSON> of <LOCATION> McAllen </LOCATION>. `` We do believe that there was smuggler involved. We believe we have a lead on a smuggler,'' he said. A smuggler may have arranged with someone to open the trailer doors once the train stopped in <LOCATION> Victoria </LOCATION>, where at least one of the men was destined, <PERSON> Reyes </PERSON> said. Four victims were found Tuesday in the truck trailer, being hauled `` piggyback'' on a flatcar, on a rail siding in <LOCATION> Victoria </LOCATION>. The fifth was spotted later near <LOCATION> Sinton </LOCATION>, a small town about 60 miles away where the train had stopped for nearly two hours overnight. Preliminary autopsy reports from <LOCATION> Travis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Medical Examiner <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Bayardo </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Nueces </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Medical Examiner <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Rupp </PERSON> showed all five died of asphyxiation by hydrogen phosphate gas. The gas was emitted by <PERSON> Phostoxin </PERSON> pesticide packets tossed into the trailer to kill boll weevils and other vermin in its cargo of corn flour, or masa, during the rail trip. `` One of the guys had some coins in his pocket and those coins were black, indicating there was poison in there,'' <PERSON> Victoria </PERSON> <PERSON> Justice </PERSON> of the Peace <PERSON> Sylvia </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON> said of one autopsy report. Complete toxicology reports could be issued later in the week, she said. The trailer had two warning stickers the size of license plates on its doors. They showed skulls and read in English and Spanish: `` Danger. This trailer is being fumigated'' and `` Do not enter.'' One of the victims was from the state of <LOCATION> Guerrero </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, one had documents from <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>, and a third had papers that had been stamped in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> but indicated he was from <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>, officials said. Authorities have found no identification for the two others. Four other illegal aliens noticed the five were sluggish during the stop in <LOCATION> Sinton </LOCATION>, police said. <ORGANIZATION> Victoria </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> Lt. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said the four, who rode the same train, found one man on the ground at <LOCATION> Sinton </LOCATION>. `` But they thought he was intoxicated,'' <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said. `` They tried to wake him, but were unable to. So, they moved him off the tracks. Then they went back to the truck where the man had been and found the others passed out.'' `` We do n't know if he got off by himself or he had help,'' san <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Patricio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Sheriff's investigator <PERSON> Johnny </PERSON> <PERSON> Segovia </PERSON>. One of the four surviving aliens was treated at a <LOCATION> Victoria </LOCATION> hospital after complaining of nausea, diarrhea and lightheadedness believed to be related to inhaling the gas, police said. <PERSON> Phostoxin </PERSON> is one of three commonly used fumigants for grain products, said <PERSON> Max </PERSON> <PERSON> Woodfin </PERSON>, agricultural resources protection officer for the <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION>. He said <PERSON> Phostoxin </PERSON> leaves no residue once the facility has been properly ventilated for at least 24 hours after fumigation.

 East German Communist leaders reaffirmed their commitment to doctrine, but expressed willingness Wednesday to discuss reform in search of an `` attractive socialism'' to counter growing discontent with the rigid regime. A statement from the ruling Politburo capped a day of conflicting signals about whether the East Germans would maintain the course of hard-line leader <PERSON> Erich </PERSON> <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON> or join the reform spreading through Eastern <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. In addressing the flight of tens of thousands of East Germans, the statement said: `` We are n't indifferent when people who worked and lived here renounce our <LOCATION> German </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Democratic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>. The reasons for the step could be varied. We must and will seek out them among ourselves, each in his place, all of us together. `` Together we want to discuss all of the basic questions of our society which must be solved today and tomorrow,'' and suggestions `` for a strategic conception of continuity and change'' will be made at a <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> meeting scheduled for late November or early December, the Politburo declared. `` All expressions of opinion and suggestions for attractive socialism ... are important,'' said the statement, distributed by the official news agency <ORGANIZATION> ADN </ORGANIZATION>. `` We are open to discussions.'' It did not mention the growing opposition movement, but urged East Germans to refrain from the kind of street demonstrations that swept the country last week and on Monday night. Earlier Wednesday, party sources said high-ranking <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> officials had warned of possible labor unrest and demanded a report from <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON>, 77, on the nation's `` critical situation.'' <PERSON> Kurt </PERSON> <PERSON> Hager </PERSON>, the party ideologist, reversed himself and called for reform to curb the growing unrest. The demand for a report, made in the Politburo meeting Tuesday, suggests <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON> may face an internal challenge to his 18-year leadership. The sources disclosed it soon after the radio broadcast <PERSON> Hager </PERSON>'s remarks. Party sources quoted the complaining officials as telling <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON> `` there are increasing signs of coming strikes in the factories'' and `` there is no time to waste.'' <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON> was told some workers already were refusing to work overtime and called on the government to address the `` increasingly pressing questions'' of the the nation's people, the sources reported. He was asked to report by the end of the week, they said. Politburo member <PERSON> Egon </PERSON> <PERSON> Krenz </PERSON> was responsible for the restraint shown by security forces to show restraint during Monday's pro-democracy demonstrations in <LOCATION> Leipzig </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Dresden </LOCATION>, the sources said <ORGANIZATION> Krenz </ORGANIZATION> often is mentioned as a successor to <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON>. Late Wednesday, <ORGANIZATION> ADN </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON> had postponed a visit to <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION> scheduled for Oct. 25-26. No reason was given. <PERSON> Hager </PERSON>, one of the hierarchy's most influential figures, recommended a greater role for the people in solving national problems, a more open society and reform of the state-controlled news media. He did not suggest specific actions. The ideologist, also 77, made the recommendations in an interview Saturday with the Soviet weekly newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Moscow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> while street protests were under way and Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> was visiting <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. State radio read his comments Wednesday. Earlier in the day, the party newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Neues </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deutschland </ORGANIZATION> vigorously defended the country's communist system `` Our task in the immediate future is to come up with a clear concept for the development of necessary changes,'' said <PERSON> Hager </PERSON>, who has been known as a hard-liner opposed to the Gorbachev-style reforms in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. `` That will require, above all, the active involvement of the people in solving important problems and a new policy of public information. A freer and broader discussion is developing in the press.'' Virtually all news media are under strict official control. Referring to the mass exodus, mostly of skilled young people, <PERSON> Hager </PERSON> said: `` All of the obstacles have to be cleared away that have apparently prevented our youth from developing their full potential.'' He said the government should respond to the `` needs and mood'' of the people. During his two-day visit last week for <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s 40th anniversary, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> urged <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON> to make democratic reforms. In <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION>, chief government spokesman <PERSON> Hans </PERSON> <PERSON> Klein </PERSON> repeated <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s offer of `` wide-ranging help'' if <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> implements reforms. <PERSON> Guenter </PERSON> <PERSON> Krusche </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Lutheran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>, told <ORGANIZATION> Deutschlandfunk </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Cologne </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, he was `` optimistic that a dialogue will soon start between the nation's leadership and the opposition movement. Party officials in <LOCATION> Dresden </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Leipzig </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Magdeburg </LOCATION> have either started talks with pro-democracy activists or plan them, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> German </LOCATION> news reports say.

 The owners of a ship wrecked off <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION> in 1941 with 20,300 cases of Scotch whisky on board said Wednesday they plan to salvage what's left of the cargo. Despite the efforts of police and customs officers, most of the cargo was looted by the Hebridean islanders of <LOCATION> Eriskay </LOCATION> and the neighboring islands of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Uist </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Barra </PERSON> when the Politician was wrecked on rocks off Eriskay. The ship made Eriskay famous and brought it a tourist trade that continues to this day. Salvagers believe the wreck, buried in sand in 20-foot waters off <PERSON> Eriskay </PERSON>'s north coast, still contains 2,000 to 4,000 cases of whisky and possibly eight metal cases of Jamaican currency, said spokesman <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Gilfeather </PERSON>. The owners of the salvage rights include several financiers, a diver and a lawyer, he said. The group plans to offer shares to the public to raise a minimum of $ 800,000 needed to recover the sunken cargo, <PERSON> Gilfeather </PERSON> said. The operation is expected to take place in the spring, he said. `` I do n't think anybody would take the chance of drinking'' the whisky, <PERSON> Gilfeather </PERSON> said. `` It would be a collector's item.'' The booze was so plentiful on Eriskay in the 1940s that women were seen pouring it on peat fires to make them burn more easily. The wreck gave novelist <PERSON> Compton </PERSON> <PERSON> Mackenzie </PERSON> the plot for his comic novel, `` Whiskey Galore.'' It was made into a film of the same name in 1948, but renamed `` Tight Little Island'' for release in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> adjourned its special session Wednesday after refusing to pass any of the restrictions on abortions that Gov. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> demanded. Adjournment came just one day after lawmakers convened the special session that <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> called after the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruled that states could impose limits. The session had attracted thousands of demonstrators on both sides of the issue. `` A right, having been established, is not easily removed,'' House Speaker <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Gustafson </PERSON> said. `` Once the right to choice was established and clearly understood ... the right to privacy established and clearly understood, people do not willingly give up those freedoms.'' Lawmakers in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> shot down proposals that would have curbed abortion in many ways, including cutting public financing and toughening clinic regulations. The session, first in the nation after the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruling, had been viewed as a bellwether. More than 10,000 demonstrators descended upon the quiet Southern capital to wage the first pitched battle since the July decision that upheld <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> abortion limits. The governor's original goals included banning public financing for abortions, requiring viability tests on the fetuses of women at least 20 weeks pregnant and requiring physicians to tell women seeking abortions about the development of their fetuses. <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> conceded his initiative had faltered badly. `` I do n't think it's a moment for rejoicing,'' the first-term <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> governor said. `` If anything, it's a moment of sadness.'' The governor criticized lawmakers for failing to bring any of his proposals up for a full floor vote. `` You ca n't make a determination by a handful of people in a committee on an issue this vital,'' he said. `` I think that the will of the people would have been better served if all the people would have been represented.'' But national leaders of the pro-choice movement seized the opportunity to call the failed session a sign of a turning tide. `` <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> has just sent a message to the nation,'' said <PERSON> Eleanor </PERSON> <PERSON> Smeal </PERSON>, president of the Fund for a <ORGANIZATION> Feminist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Majority </ORGANIZATION> and a former president of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Women </ORGANIZATION>. `` Political leaders are getting a public-opinion message that they can not, should not, restrict or interfere with women's rights any longer. And people do n't want any more restrictions on abortion.'' <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> Ireland </PERSON>, national vice president of NOW, was jubilant. `` What we're seeing this session is a shift by women's rights supporters from the defensive to the offensive,'' she said at a news conference. `` This is one of those junctures where the political climate has clearly changed. This is creating a new wave of feminism that we have not had since the 1960s.'' <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Connor </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Right </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> To </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Life </ORGANIZATION>, said the fight is not over. `` What's next is we go back to work. We field new candidates who affirm the sanctity and dignity of human life,'' he said. `` We explore the potential for a constitutional amendment.'' The governor had held out hope that tougher standards for clinics _ among the least controversial of the bills _ would pass. But a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> committee killed three bills on clinic regulation Wednesday, after five other bills died in <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> committee. In the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, six bills met a similar fate in subcommittee Wednesday. A <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> committee also killed a measure to put abortion restrictions before voters in the form of a constitutional amendment. That amendment would have allowed counties to raise property taxes to pay for the care of poor, pregnant women and their babies, and would have restricted abortions to cases involving rape, incest, the health of the mother and deformed fetuses. Lawmakers had predicted the session would accomplish little after a <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruling last week that the state's privacy amendment protects a woman's right to an abortion The justices knocked down a 1988 parental-consent law for <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> minors seeking abortions, and also ruled the state Constitution protects women's abortion rights in the first trimester. The governor's rout in the abortion session was reminiscent of a similar drubbing he took in efforts to pass a tax on services. His popularity took a beating and he later pushed successfully to repeal the law. He faces re-election in 1990. Senate President <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Crawford </PERSON> refused to speculate on the political damage to <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON>, who faces re-election in 1990. `` There's probably lessons for everybody here,'' he said. House Speaker <PERSON> Gustafson </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s experience should not be considered a crystal ball for the rest of the nation. `` I think every state is different,'' he said.

<HEAD>Romanian Baptists Sentenced for Building Church</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Four Romanians have been sentenced in that communist country for their parts in building a <ORGANIZATION> Baptist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> without government permission, <ORGANIZATION> Keston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> reported Wednesday. The London-based research institute, which monitors religious freedom in communist nations, said the four Baptists were sentenced to `` corrective labor sentences'' Oct. 5 in Gheorghe Gheorgiu-dej. It said the men were required to pay part of their earnings to the government and live under house arrest. <PERSON> Nicolae </PERSON> <PERSON> Iacob </PERSON> was sentenced to two years, eight months for his role in building the <ORGANIZATION> Comanesti </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Baptist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Valentin </PERSON> <PERSON> Rusu </PERSON> to two years, six months and <PERSON> Mihai </PERSON> <PERSON> Cretu </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gheorghe </PERSON> <PERSON> Iacobuta </PERSON> to one year, the college said. One sentence was believed to have been suspended, <ORGANIZATION> Keston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> said, but added that it did not know which one or how much was to be deducted from the men's wages. There are 200,000 Baptists in <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>, a nation of 23 million. Romanian authorities say the church, demolished May 31, was built without proper authorization, but <ORGANIZATION> Keston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> said the men were charged with using stolen building materials. `` The sentences handed down on two of the Baptists ... appear to exceed the provisions specified in Romanian law,'' it said in a statement. `` Under the April 1973 amendments to the penal code ... the maximum sentence of compulsory labor that can be imposed is two years. Between 15 and 50 percent of a person's wages may be deducted.'' <ORGANIZATION> Keston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> reported three other men `` who had apparently transported the building materials'' were being tried, but `` there is no information yet as to what sentences they received.''

<TEXT>
 A <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee voted 21-0 Wednesday evening to approve a clean air bill designed to substantially reduce urban smog, acid rain and airborne toxic chemicals by the end of the century. The House Energy and Commerce environment subcommittee used President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s clean air proposal as a first draft. The bill that emerged from the panel included substantially tougher auto tailpipe emissions standards, putting the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> requirements into effect for the entire country. Just before the final vote, the subcommittee substantially eased <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s proposal to require clean-burning auto fuels in smoggy cities and force automakers to build cars able to burn those fuels. The sponsors of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s proposal led the charge to change the bill, which was done by a 12-10 vote after top administration officials gave conflicting positions in simultaneous phone calls to subcommittee members. The auto and petroleum industries had backed the change. It was the first time the subcommittee had approved an overhaul of clean air legislation since 1977, though a review was due in 1981. Previous attempts were defeated in subcommittee or never reached a vote. The bill can next go either to a second Energy and <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee or the full <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. The energy and power subcommittee has not decided whether it wants a chance to examine the acid rain provisions of the bill, which require major reductions in emissions of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides by coal-burning utilities in the East. The vote on clean-fueled cars would eliminate a requirement that automakers build a million cars annually from 1997 through 2004 to run on gasoline substitutes, to be sold in the nation's smoggiest cities. The new version would allow the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> to order the cars built, but only after taking into account potential consumer acceptance, technological feasibility, health, safety, air quality improvement, fuel availability, capability of production and other factors. It also would define clean fuels in a way that environmentalists said would bring little pollution reduction. Clean fuels would be anything that achieved the same pollution reductions from ordinary gasoline as is achieved by a mixture of 85 percent methanol and 15 percent gasoline. The vote turned previous debates on <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s bill upside own, with chief sponsors <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> Lent </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.Y. </LOCATION> and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dingell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Mich </LOCATION>. urging the change _ and winning support from most subcommittee Republicans who have general backed <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> Subcommittee Chairman <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Waxman </PERSON>, D-Calif., who has been largely critical of the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> plan, strongly defended the president's proposal for clean-fueled cars and accused Lent of `` trashing the administration proposal you introduced. Even more bizarre were separate and conflicting phone calls, made about 1 p.m. by <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> Administrator <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Reilly </PERSON> from <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> Chief of Staff <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> from the White House. <PERSON> Waxman </PERSON> said <PERSON> Reilly </PERSON> told him to oppose the amendment, sponsored by Reps. <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Hall </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Fields </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Texas </LOCATION>. Lent said <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> informed him the administration was neutral on the amendment. `` <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> called my office and assured me that President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> does not oppose this amendment,'' Lent said. `` He sent a member of the White House staff -LRB- to the committee room -RRB- to say the president does not oppose ... the administration does not support'' the amendment. <PERSON> Waxman </PERSON> replied, `` I talked to <PERSON> Reilly </PERSON> this afternoon and he informed me the administration is against Hall-Fields. ... I asked him if I could represent that as the administration position and he said ` yes.''' <PERSON> Waxman </PERSON> continued, `` I do n't know where the administration is and it may be all over the lot ... on both sides. It tells a lot about how they're handling the bill.'' Later, <PERSON> Waxman </PERSON> said, `` The winners are going to be the oil industry and the auto industry.'' He added there would be future fights on the same issue in the full committee and on the floor. After <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s bill was introduced, the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> called the clean fuels proposal `` perhaps the most innovative and far-reaching component'' of the proposals to reduce ozone, a major component of the haze that hangs over most American cities. <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Sykes </PERSON>, a lobbyist for <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, said the carmakers did n't like <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s language to force them to build clean-fueled cars because there was no guarantee consumers would buy them. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> legislation did not specify use of any particular fuel, but the oil industry contended it would have given strong authority to the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> to choose one. Oil companies said <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> favored methanol, an alcohol used by some racing cars. As a pure fuel, it produces much less ozone than gasoline, but mixed with gasoline, as in the 85-15 ratio spelled out in the bill, pollution reductions are less. Its major pollution is formaldehyde, a cancer-causing chemical little studied in the atmosphere. The oil industry and lawmakers from districts where other alternative fuels like natural gas and propane are produced argued that every clean-burning fuel should have an equal chance to power <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s future cars, and contended the Hall-Fields amendment would do so.

 The National Organization for Women and other groups, buoyed by the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION>'s refusal to toughen <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s abortion laws, hope a new women's - rights wave will propel pro-choice candidates into state and national offices, activists `` This is creating a new wave of feminism that we have not had since the 1960s,'' said <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> Ireland </PERSON>, NOW's national vice president. `` We're seeing the impact of this session all over the country.'' The pro-choice forces were shocked by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> decision allowing states to restrict abortions, and this legislative session became a rallying point for action, the activists said. <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> said NOW and other groups would target anti-abortion candidates for <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, governorships and statehouses for defeat in 1990. `` What we're seeing this session is a shift by women's rights supporters from the defensive to the offensive,'' she said. `` This is one of those junctures where the political climate has clearly changed.'' <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kropp </PERSON>, president of People for the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Way </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION>, a liberal political action group, said politicians across the country should take note of what happened in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. `` Today's victory will be a rude wake-up call for politicians hoping to score points at the polls by rolling back reproductive freedom,'' <PERSON> Kropp </PERSON> said. `` Legislators in other states should take heed: pro-choice politics is winning politics, even in conservative states.'' In <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, NOW state President <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Blimling </PERSON> said the organization hopes to elect eight more women in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and five in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. At present, there are 16 women in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and 10 in the upper chamber. The House has 120 members; the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> 40. She said the organization's 36 <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> chapters are gathering information on anti-abortion legislators and would use their stances in the next round of elections. Gov. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON>, a Republican who called the special legislative session, has seriously harmed himself among pro-choice women voters who wo n't forget, said <PERSON> Eleanor </PERSON> <PERSON> Smeal </PERSON>, president of the Fund for the Feminist Majority. <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> is up for election to a second term next year. The two Democratic candidates for governor, state Sen. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Stuart </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Orlando </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Melbourne </LOCATION>, have both criticized <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> for calling the session. On the Republican side, state Sen. <PERSON> Marlene </PERSON> <PERSON> Woodson-Howard </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Bradenton </LOCATION> just announced her intention to oppose the governor in a <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> primary. She, too, cited his anti-abortion stance. Congressional seats will be reapportioned following the 1990 Census, and <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> could pick up as many as four seats in the House. <PERSON> Smeal </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> said much of their groups' resources would be concentrated on races in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. All three women said the special session, called soon after the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruled in July that states could further restrict abortion laws, had galvanized women _ especially younger women _ into political action. NOW organized a `` caravan for choice'' to 17 <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> cities, where they lobbied people and organized them to work against making state abortion laws more restrictive. Groups on the other side also organized their forces.

 <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> leaders made a last-ditch search Wednesday night for a way to consider President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s cut in capital-gains taxes without slowing work on a major deficit-reduction bill. In the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, which already has passed a deficit bill that includes a capital-gains cut, leaders bowed out of the hunt. `` We basically have done our work,'' Rep. <PERSON> Leon </PERSON> <PERSON> Panetta </PERSON>, D-Calif., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, told reporters `` Now the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> has to do its work.'' `` The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> has to work out its own problems,'' added Rep. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Archer </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, senior Republican on the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Means </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Maine </LOCATION>, planned one last meeting on the issue with senior colleagues, even as the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> prepared to deliberate the deficit bill. `` Hope springs eternal,'' <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> said, while assailing the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration's insistence on the capital-gains reduction. A series of closed-door leadership meetings in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> has been aimed at stripping all non-deficit issues from the deficit-reduction bill. Presumably, the big extraneous issues, including capital gains and the Democrats' proposal to expand tax-deductible <ORGANIZATION> Individual </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Retirement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounts </ORGANIZATION>, would be added to a new bill and considered later this year. Barring a major suprise, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> will begin work Thursday on the bill, a package of spending reductions and tax increases that would cut the deficit by about $ 14 billion this budget year. That bill does not include a capital-gains reduction, although supporters may try to have one added during the debate. Whether to reduce the tax on capital gains, which are profits from the sale of investments, has dominated development of the deficit-reduction bill. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> wants a cut, contending it would spur the economy and, at least in the short run, generate additional revenues for deficit reduction. Most Democrats oppose the reduction because 80 percent of the tax saving would go to those with incomes over $ 100,000 a year. They say the cut would deepen the deficit by $ 67 billion over the next 10 years. Under <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> rules, it would require 60 votes _ rather than the usual majority of 51 _ to add a capital-gains cut to the deficit bill. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Darman </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION>, said Thursday night: `` We think we have the votes to win on this,'' presumably meaning 51. `` Why not have a vote?'' he asked in an interview on the MacNeil-Lehrer Newshour on PBS. `` A majority has expressed support for some form of capital-gains or another,'' <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> said on the same program, `` but no majority has agreed to any particular plan ... No plan may possibly get a majority.'' <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> accused the administration of demanding special treatment under <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> rules so that a bare majority would be able to approve a capital-gains cut. He recalled that the minority Republicans used the same rule to their benefit earlier this year and prevailed over Democrats on a bill bailing out the savings and loan industry. `` The same rules apply to everyone equally,'' <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> said. `` It is the height of hypocrisy, the height of unfairness to say they should benefit from the rules when they are advantaged'' and that Democrats should not when the tables are turned.

 President F.W. <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON> told militant anti-apartheid leaders Wednesday he was ready to negotiate on black voting rights, but they demanded more concessions before serious talks begin. The three-hour meeting with Anglican Archbishop <PERSON> Desmond </PERSON> <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON> and two other church leaders came a day after <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON> announced his decision to free eight longtime security prisoners, including seven leaders of the outlawed <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> welcomed the plans for release and urged `` the release of all political prisoners, including <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>,'' the nation's most famous prisoner. `` I hope today's meeting will be looked on as a milestone on the positive road ahead,'' <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON> said after the talks. But <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON>, the Rev. <PERSON> Allan </PERSON> <PERSON> Boesak </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reformed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Churches </ORGANIZATION>, and the Rev. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Chikane </PERSON>, general secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Churches </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON> declined to give clear-cut responses to their demands. `` We made it clear we need results,'' <PERSON> Chikane </PERSON> said. `` Without results, we ca n't have negotiations.'' The clergymen demanded the lifting of the state of emergency, legalization of the <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and other banned groups, the release of all detainees and political prisoners, the lifting of restrictions on political activity, and clemency for prisoners on Death Row. `` If these things happen, we'll say to our people: give them -LRB- the government -RRB- a chance. They are serious,'' <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON> said. However, the clergymen said they would press on with calls for tougher economic sanctions against <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> unless de Klerk complied with their demands. <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON>, who became president in August, said the clergymen were reluctant to trust his pledges to negotiate a new, just political system. `` We are really no longer arguing about the fact that all <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africans </LOCATION> must have a vote, that all <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africans </LOCATION> must become involved in all decisions affecting their life,'' he said. `` What we must now start talking about is how do we structure that.'' <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON> opposes a one-man, one-vote system and black majority rule. He has not specified what role he envisions for blacks in the national government. The president said his government planned to consult with a wide range of South African leaders as part of a step-by-step process to negotiate a new constitution. He declined to say when the eight prisoners would be released, but other government officials said it could be within days. <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON> said <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>'s status was not discussed at Wednesday's meeting, but the 71-year-old leader is widely expected to be released within the next few months <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government hoped the planned prisoner releases `` are merely the first steps in a process which will see the release of all political prisoners, including <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>, and the return of political exiles, lifting of the state of emergency and associated restrictions on political activity, and negotiations on a peaceful transition to a nonracial and democratic <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Sisulu </PERSON>, the most prominent of the eight prisoners, is a close friend of <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> and was a major <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> leader before the organization was banned in 1960. <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> <PERSON> Mpetha </PERSON>, who at 80 is the oldest political prisoner in the country, is also among the eight. He was seen Wednesday at <LOCATION> Groote </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Schuur </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION>, where he has spent most of his five-year prison term. Police used tear gas and batons to stop black youths from entering a sports stadium in the mixed-race township of <LOCATION> Athlone </LOCATION>, near <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION>, where about 3,000 had gathered to celebrate <PERSON> Mpetha </PERSON>'s expected release. Police blocked the crowd from marching out of the stadium, and the youths sang freedom songs before dispersing quietly when they were told <PERSON> Mpetha </PERSON> had not yet been freed. The Prisons Service declined to give details about where, when and how each prisoner would be released. In addition to <PERSON> Sisulu </PERSON>, those to be released include four other men sentenced to life in prison with <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> in 1964 in connection with a guerrilla sabotage campaign to overthrow the white government. They are <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON> <PERSON> Kathrada </PERSON>, 60; <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Mlangeni </PERSON>, 63; <PERSON> Elias </PERSON> <PERSON> Motsoaledi </PERSON>, 65; and <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Mhlaba </PERSON>, 69, all identified at their trial as members of the high command of the <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> military wing, Spear of the Nation.

 Trade negotiations will not substantially cut the multibillion dollar <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade deficit with <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and it might go higher in the near future, economists told a congressional hearing Wednesday. The <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> also was also told that Japanese consumers' tolerance for high prices will remain an invisible trade barrier, and that the two countries disagree on the meaning of `` open markets.'' A former <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade negotiator, <PERSON> Clyde </PERSON> <PERSON> Prestowitz </PERSON>, pressed for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to develop a national industrial policy under which it would negotiate for results more specific than what he called the unworkable and unrealistic targets of open markets and free trade. <PERSON> Prestowitz </PERSON> is the author of `` Trading Places: How we Allowed <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> to Take the Lead,'' a book about the two countries' economic rivalry. Trade is already managed in some areas, and <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s trade partners have industrial policies, he said, `` so I would like to see it managed intelligently.'' <PERSON> Prestowitz </PERSON> cited as examples of managed trade, semiconductors, automobiles, machine tools, steel, textiles, air transport and fishing. Current market-opening policies aggravate tension by spawning accusations of unfairness, <PERSON> Prestowitz </PERSON> said, maintaining that Japanese do not clearly understand what Americans mean by `` open markets'' and American exporters do not grasp Japanese urgings for them to `` try harder.'' <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Z. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON>, senior economist at the <ORGANIZATION> Brookings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institution </ORGANIZATION>, a private policy research organization, urged against what he called a `` quick fix'' to the trade imbalance by negotiating for `` results rather than rules.'' `` In fact, the evidence suggests that the twin policies of a strong yen and detailed negotiations,'' product by product, are working, if slowly, to increase imports by <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, he said. Managed trade, he said, would greatly increase Japanese government influence over the private sector and the result would be to subject <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s most competitive high technology industries to `` intense competition'' from targeted exports. <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> acknowledged, however, that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar's regained strength against then Japanese yen points to little or no improvement in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade deficit with <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> in the next year or two. `` It could well get worse,'' he said _ but if measured in Japanese yen, instead of dollars, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> deficit shows decline. The imbalance `` will be relatively unaffected'' by trade developments, said <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ahearn </PERSON>, trade specialist of the <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. The deficit with <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, $ 52 billion last year, `` will tend to get worse,'' <PERSON> Prestowitz </PERSON> said. `` It's going to be hard to have a trade surplus so long as we have low savings'' in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, he added.

<HEAD>Racially Inflamed Fights Break Out at Alabama, Arkansas Schools</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 One student was stabbed and six others arrested in a racially inflamed melee at an <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> high school, and at least 300 students at Central High School in <LOCATION> Little </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rock </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ark. </LOCATION>, were involved in similar fistfights Wednesday, authorities and witnesses said. Students were sent home at <ORGANIZATION> Minor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> near <LOCATION> Adamsville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ala. </LOCATION>, after days of racial tension sparked violence that began in the school cafeteria. <PERSON> Principal </PERSON> <PERSON> Judson </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> had called students to the cafeteria to discuss friction among black and white students, when a shove escalated into a Mace-spraying, gunshots-firing melee, witnesses said. `` While we were in the lunchroom, two white guys came into the lunchroom, stood up on some tables and began spraying <PERSON> Mace </PERSON> in the faces of -LRB- black -RRB- students,'' said 15-year-old student <PERSON> Kimberly </PERSON> <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>. `` Then fights broke out all over the school, inside and outside the building.'' A teacher, who was not identified, fired gunshots into the air in an attempt to break up fighting, and a 17-year-old senior, <PERSON> Johnny </PERSON> <PERSON> Drummonds </PERSON>, was treated for a shoulder stab wound and released from <ORGANIZATION> Lloyd </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Noland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>. The principal received minor cuts when he tried to intervene. `` There was mass confusion, running and screaming everywhere,'' said police Sgt. <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Benson </PERSON>. Thirty patrol cars were called to the school, where classes were expected to resume Thursday under tight security. The gun-toting teacher will be disciplined, said <PERSON> Nez </PERSON> <PERSON> Calhoun </PERSON>, spokeswoman for the <LOCATION> Jefferson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> school board. At least 60 students, half blacks and half whites, were involved. About 25 percent of the school's 967 students are black. Police said tension at the school was due partly to black gang activity and what black students perceive as taunting by white students. Miss <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> said black students were angered during homecoming festivities last week when a white student came to school with black paint on his hands and face and an afro wig on his head. A pep rally Friday at Minor High was marred by yelling and pushing between black and white students. The six students arrested, one 18-year-old and five juveniles, had not yet been processed at the <ORGANIZATION> Jefferson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sheriff </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and specific charges against them were not immediately available, said Lt. <PERSON> Earl </PERSON> <PERSON> Patterson </PERSON> In <LOCATION> Little </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rock </LOCATION>, at least a half-dozen fistfights broke out after a burning effigy of a red devil, mascot of a rival school, fell from a tree across from Central High onto the car of a black student during an outdoor, homecoming pep rally, <ORGANIZATION> Principal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Everett </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hawks </ORGANIZATION> said. Fighting spread quickly, spilling into school hallways. In 1957, President <PERSON> Eisenhower </PERSON> sent federal troops to protect nine black students who integrated Central High in a mob-violence atmosphere. `` It started out by being a ruckus, like 1957, except the blacks were the majority and the whites were the minority. Simple as that, and I'm black,'' senior class president <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said. The 16-year-old owner of the car said he instigated a fight after friends pointed out a white student as the person responsible for damage to the auto. <ORGANIZATION> Hawks </ORGANIZATION> said a white student is believed responsible, but not the one attacked by the student and his friends. A hubcap and side panel near a tire on the car were singed by flames. `` It became a real significant racial issue. That's scary for us and tragic,'' <PERSON> Hawks </PERSON> said. Central High has 1,813 students, 58 percent of whom are black. No charges were expected and no weapons were involved, city police Officer <PERSON> Jason </PERSON> <PERSON> Shook </PERSON> said.

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A 3-year-old boy found his mother choking on a cough drop and calmly called 911, asked for help and directed firefighters to the condominium where they saved the woman. `` I think he went above and beyond the call of duty,'' said Capt. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Biggs </PERSON>, one of three firefighters who responded to the call. <PERSON> Jameson </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodgers </PERSON>, who turns 4 on Thursday, found his mother, <PERSON> Peggy </PERSON>, 32, doubled up on the living room floor Tuesday. Trained since age 2 to dial 911 in case of emergency, <PERSON> Jameson </PERSON> went to a telephone placed low on the wall just for him and called for help. An excerpt of the emergency call reveals the boys calm under pressure. <PERSON> Jameson </PERSON>: `` Hi.'' Dispatcher: `` Can I help you?'' <PERSON> Jameson </PERSON>: `` My mommy's not breathing.'' Dispatcher: `` Can your mommy come to the phone?'' <PERSON> Jameson </PERSON>: `` My mommy ca n't talk now ... my mommy's choking.'' A firefighter was able to dislodge the cough drop from the woman's throat, and after a few minutes she was breathing normally. Although <PERSON> Jameson </PERSON> was n't able to give the emergency dispatcher his address, the call was automatically traced and rescuers arrived quickly, <PERSON> Biggs </PERSON> said. The boy apologized to firefighters about his forgetfulness. `` I really did know my address,'' he said. <PERSON> Jameson </PERSON>, the grandson of 1950s and 1960s pop singer <PERSON> Jimmie </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodgers </PERSON> learned to dial 911 on the special phone during his mother's second pregnancy in case she went into labor while his father, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON>, 26, was n't home. The boy's grandfather recorded such hits such as `` Honeycomb'' and `` Kisses Sweeter Than Wine.''

 The hemisphere is showing a `` healthy tendency toward freedom of expression,'' <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Jimenez </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Inter-American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday. `` This year has been very significant in the history of freedom of the press and expression in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Jimenez </PERSON> said in his final report to <ORGANIZATION> IAPA </ORGANIZATION> members at their 45th general assembly. <LOCATION> Paraguay </LOCATION>, whose dictatorship under Gen. <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON> ended in a coup by Gen. <PERSON> Andres </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> earlier this year, `` is on the road to re-establishing, after many, many years, a real democracy and also creating a climate of freedom of the press and expression,'' <PERSON> Jimenez </PERSON> said. The two leading candidates for president of <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Hernan </PERSON> <PERSON> Buchi </PERSON> and <PERSON> Patricio </PERSON> <PERSON> Aylwin </PERSON>, have been recognized by <ORGANIZATION> IAPA </ORGANIZATION> for their struggle to re-establish press freedoms after 16 years of military rule by Gen. <PERSON> Augusto </PERSON> <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>, he said. Mexican President <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Gortari </PERSON>'s announcment that the government would sell its newsprint monopoly was received with `` great surprise and satisfaction,'' he said. `` There's no doubt that all the above represents extraordinary news and that there exists in the continent a healty tendency toward freedom of expression,'' <PERSON> Jimenez </PERSON> said. `` But as there have been exceptionally good things, the Republic of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> remains a dark and nebulous point,'' he added. `` There, the government of Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Noreiga </PERSON> recently terminated the only vestige of freedom of expression and has seized the last independent television channel,'' said <PERSON> Jimenez </PERSON>, of the daily newspaper <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nacion </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION>. The result of the Feb. 25 national elections in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> will determine whether press freedoms are reinstated in that country, he said. Regarding the Nicaraguan elections, <ORGANIZATION> IAPA </ORGANIZATION> members held a lengthy debate over holding the organization's planned midyear meeting in <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION> in March. Although they decided to maintain the site, several members said the organization should not become involved in the `` massive fraud'' expected by the Sandinista government. `` All the signs show that the elections are going to be a fraud,'' said <PERSON> German </PERSON> <PERSON> Ornes </PERSON>, former <ORGANIZATION> IAPA </ORGANIZATION> president and editor of the daily <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Caribe </ORGANIZATION> newspaper of <LOCATION> Santo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Domingo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Dominican </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>. `` We are talking about a possible loss of money against people who have lost their freedom and their lives,'' said <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Hampton </PERSON>, editor of the <ORGANIZATION> Miami </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION>. `` I would be astonished if there were n't fraud.'' <PERSON> Violeta </PERSON> <PERSON> Chamorro </PERSON>, owner of the daily Nicaraguan opposition newspaper <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prensa </ORGANIZATION>, has vowed to restore press freedoms if she wins the elections. `` It's a statement of our principles and belief in free expression. If a miracle occurs and <PERSON> Violeta </PERSON> wins, it would be a hell of a celebration,'' <PERSON> Hampton </PERSON> said in an interview after the debate. `` But if the expected occurs and the election is stolen than it's an occassion for us to point out what happens, to deplore it and let the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> know that we've got our eye on them,'' <PERSON> Hampton </PERSON> said. Not going to <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION> would be `` handing the Sandinista government a real victory'' and would demonstrate that `` somehow we're afraid to go,'' said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> McQuire </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION> deputy managing editor for national and international news. `` We would be denying ourselves an opportunity of fulfilling one of our most noble purposes ... and demonstrating solidarity with our collegues who are being suppressed and suffering indignities,'' <PERSON> McQuire </PERSON> said. In another <ORGANIZATION> IAPA </ORGANIZATION> matter, the organization's general assembly recommended that member newspapers publish a 400-word editorial regarding Tuesday's killings of Colombian journalists and the attack on the life of a <LOCATION> Salvadoran </LOCATION> journalist and the death of his wife. `` The climate of terror imposed by the drug cartels on the free Colombian press has no comparison in the history of the continent,'' said the editorial, written by <PERSON> Augusto </PERSON> <PERSON> Nunez </PERSON> of the daily newspaper <ORGANIZATION> O </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Estado </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Sao </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paulo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>. `` Dictatorships and authoritarian regimes that for many decades have punished the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> nations always have included independent journalists among their favorite targets,'' he wrote. `` But those governments never have tried to institutionalize the systematic extermination of those journalists that defend laws and institutions,'' <PERSON> Nunez </PERSON> wrote.

<TEXT>
 Hard-liners in Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s right-wing <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> bloc demanded dismantling of the coalition government Wednesday, saying the rival <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> was working toward establishment of a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> state Doves in the left-leaning <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION>'s coalition partner, also said the government should end. In the occupied lands, four Palestinians were shot and wounded in clashes with <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> troops, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> hospitals said. The army command said two soldiers were slightly hurt when acid was thrown at them in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> town of <LOCATION> Hebron </LOCATION>. Two firebombs were thrown at an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> car in annexed east <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>. The driver was burned on the arm and his leg was injured when he lost control of the vehicle and crashed into a wall, police spokesman <PERSON> Uzi </PERSON> <PERSON> Sandouri </PERSON> said. A bomb exploded under a truck in a Jewish neighborhood in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, slightly damaging the truck but causing no injuries, police said. <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> hard-liners rallied in <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION> to urge rejection of a U.S.-proposed meeting of Israeli, Egyptian and <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> officials to work out terms for Israeli-Palestinian talks in <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION>. Led by Industry Minister <PERSON> Ariel </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON>, among others, they view <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>'s idea as an attempt to lure <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> into talks with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> and trade territory for peace. The two-hour, informal gathering was attended by hundreds of representatives of <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION>'s 2,400-member governing central committee who support hard-line ministers in the Likud-Labor government formed last Dec. 22. `` If <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> continues to bother us in <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> and the media and to seek assistance of the Americans, the Egyptians and other countries, I propose to go to elections,'' Economy Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Modai </PERSON> declared, to applause. `` They are going to lead us toward a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> state, which would endanger <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s existence and which they see as a guarantee of prosperity and peace. The rift is enormous.'' <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio said <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> had asked rebellious leaders to cancel the session, saying it would complicate the political process. Senior officials in Finance Minister <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON> <PERSON> Peres </PERSON>' Labor Party appeared willing to wait, but several dovish leaders in the party said the government should be brought down. `` <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION>'s refusal to accept the Baker initiative would lead us to government dismantling,'' said <PERSON> Chaim </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramon </PERSON>, head of <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> faction `` The possibilities are open: elections ... or a government led by us or being in opposition.'' He told <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> TV </ORGANIZATION> after a meeting with other Labor ministers, `` We are united in our view that an end to the peace initiative will lead to the end of our partership, but we are not united regarding the timing now, or in two weeks or after <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s visit to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>'' in November. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> has occupied the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> since capturing them from <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> in the 1967 <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> war. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> wants <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to give up some occupied land for peace, but <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> opposes returning any territory. `` This meeting confirms the real stand of <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION>,'' said <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON>. He repeated his demand that the 22-month Palestinian uprising be brought to an end before any negotiations start. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> leans toward the <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> idea, but only on condition the tripartite meeting be devoted to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s own peace plan. It calls for elections in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> to choose Palestinian negotiators for talks on limited autonomy. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> advanced his proposal after <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s decision-making, 12-member inner Cabinet split along party lines Friday and rejected an Egyptian offer to act as host for an Israeli-Palestinian discussion of the election plan in <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION>. Labor supported acceptance of the Egyptian invitation, designed to bypass <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s opposition to talks with the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>. The coalition was shaken further Wednesday when <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> sent a letter to <PERSON> Peres </PERSON>, demanding that Deputy Finance Minister <PERSON> Yossi </PERSON> <PERSON> Beilin </PERSON>, known for his dovish views, be fired. <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> has refused to dismiss his top aide.

<HEAD>Body of Soviet Yachtsman Found Hanging from Tree</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PUNTA DEL ESTE, Uruguay (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The body of the co-captain of a Soviet yacht participating in the Fifth Whitbread Round The World Race was found hanging from a tree Wednesday near this seaside resort, police said. Police said the body of <PERSON> Alexei </PERSON> <PERSON> Gryshenko </PERSON>, reported missing Tuesday by crew of the yacht <PERSON> Fasizi </PERSON>, was found by a passearching for firewood in a pine grove two miles from <LOCATION> Punta </LOCATION> <LOCATION> del </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Este </LOCATION>. A letter, written in Russian and apparently dated Monday, was found nearby, said police officers, who spoke on condition of anonymity. The Soviet Embassy in the Uruguayan caser-by who was pital of <LOCATION> Montevideo </LOCATION>, 88 miles west of this beach resort, said it had no information regarding the discovery of <PERSON> Gryshenko </PERSON>'s body. <PERSON> Gryshenko </PERSON> and <PERSON> Skip </PERSON> <PERSON> Novak </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> served as co-captains of <LOCATION> Fasizi </LOCATION>, which arrived here on Oct. 1, the seventh yacht to complete the first of six legs of the 33,000-mile Whitbread race. Fasizi, sponsored by <ORGANIZATION> Pepsi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cola </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Aeroflot </ORGANIZATION>, the Soviet airline, was among 23 yachts that left <LOCATION> Southampton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, on Sept. 2, on the 6,200-mile voyage to <ORGANIZATION> Punta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> del </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Este </ORGANIZATION>. The vessels are scheduled to begin the next leg to Fremante, <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>, on Oct. 28. Police said <PERSON> Gryshenko </PERSON>, wearing a blue sweatshirt, jeans and white sneakers, had been reported missing Tuesday by members of <PERSON> Fasiis </PERSON> was a legitimate sighting. <PERSON> Knell </PERSON> thinks he knows why the people who spotted something in <LOCATION> Queens </LOCATION> never saw aliens or spoke with them. `` I believe they have their own agenda, and at this time it does n't include communication,'' said <PERSON> Knell </PERSON>, who addressed several skeptical reporters at the site where the UFO allegedly burned the ground. Unfortunately, that's also the site where the remnants of a downed tree were piled, killing off all the grass underneath, said park maintenance man <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Mackey </PERSON>, 60. `` If there was a spot around here burned out, I woulda known about it,'' said <PERSON> Mackey </PERSON>, who spends three days a week in the park. `` It's a figment of somebody's imagination.'' Perhaps, but <PERSON> Knell </PERSON>'s not alone. Some residents of <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> region say the Soviet description of a UFO is similar to a fast-moving metallic ball they spotted earlier this month <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Abide </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> said he first saw the object about three or four months ago. He saw it again early Wednesday while on his way to work at <ORGANIZATION> Abide </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aero </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Flying </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> about five miles south of <LOCATION> Greenville </LOCATION>. `` And it did n't come out of a bottle of vodka,'' he said, referring to some speculation about the Soviet witnesses. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Kimmel </PERSON>, a pilot, said he saw the object two days ago while flying to <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn </LOCATION>. He said it was round, metallic, kept changing colors and was moving 800 to 900 mph at 3,000 feet some distance off his left wingtip. `` There was no way it was a weather balloon because no balloon can travel that fast,'' he said.

 Hurricane Hugo killed 26 people in <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virgin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION> when it swept through the area in September, the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday. The figure brings to at least 74 the total number known dead from the hurricane, which devastated several <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> islands as well as parts of the <LOCATION> Carolinas </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> said in a release that 18 people died in <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION> and eight died in the <LOCATION> Virgin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION>, including five on the resort island of <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Croix </LOCATION> and three on nearby <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Thomas </LOCATION>. Previous reports indicated 14 had died in <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION> and three in the <LOCATION> Virgin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION>. The numbers include those killed during the storm Sept. 17-18 and subsequent hurricane-related deaths, such as injured victims who later died and power linesmen killed while repairing downed lines, said <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Clowe </PERSON>. The storm also killed 11 in <LOCATION> Guadeloupe </LOCATION>, 11 in <LOCATION> Montserrat </LOCATION>, one in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kitts </LOCATION> and 25 in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, authorities have said.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said in a Wednesday meeting with the president of <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is concerned about an Italian company suspected of selling the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> technology used to build a supersonic jetfighter, officials said. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> notified <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> earlier this month that <PERSON> Olivetti </PERSON>, one of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s largest computer and office equipment companies, was suspected of violating bans on the transfer of sophisticated technology to the communist bloc, said <LOCATION> Italian </LOCATION> Foreign Minister <PERSON> Gianni </PERSON> <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Michelis </PERSON>. `` We are now investigating in <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Michelis </PERSON> said, adding that the results of the investigation would be conveyed at an Oct. 22 meeting in the Italian capital with Assistant Secretary of State <PERSON> Reginald </PERSON> <PERSON> Bartholomew </PERSON>. President <PERSON> Francesco </PERSON> <PERSON> Cossiga </PERSON> told <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> that the investigation into the Olivetti allegations was `` being pursued in ... a highly cooperative manner,'' Assistant Secretary of State <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Seitz </PERSON> told reporters. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Italian officials declined to discuss the suspected sale publicly, citing the sensitive nature of the information. `` This is essentially an intelligence source,'' said one official. Another American official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said <ORGANIZATION> Olivetti </ORGANIZATION> was suspected of having sold the Soviets machine tools and computer software that was used to manufacture components for a highly sophisticated jetfighter known as the Yak-41. The plane is capable of taking off vertically. Another official said the sales had been going on for several years, and involved `` less than $ 50 million.'' The Milan newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Corriere </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Della </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sera </ORGANIZATION> said in a report on the matter that unspecified `` military sources'' confirmed that <ORGANIZATION> Olivetti </ORGANIZATION> sales of systems and software enabled the plane to be produced. In <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>, Premier <PERSON> Giulio </PERSON> <PERSON> Andreotti </PERSON> met for about an hour Wednesday with <ORGANIZATION> Olivetti </ORGANIZATION> chairman <PERSON> Carlo </PERSON> <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Benedetti </PERSON>, one of the most powerful businessmen in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. Neither made any statements at the end of the meeting. <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> is one of 17 members of the Paris-based <ORGANIZATION> Coordinating </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Multilateral </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Export </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Controls </ORGANIZATION>, which regulates the sale of high technology to communist countries. Problems have arisen often in recent years regarding sales of so-called `` dual use'' technology, which can be converted to manufacture weapons. The most well-known case of such a violation involved the sale to the Soviets of computerized milling equipment by <ORGANIZATION> Toshiba </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and the Norwegian state-owned <ORGANIZATION> Kongsberg </ORGANIZATION> conglomerate. The equipment was used by the Soviets to make silent propellers for submarines, making them harder for the West to detect. As a result, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> passed legislation last year empowering the administration to impose sanctions, including import bans, against companies found in violation of <ORGANIZATION> COCOM </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Michelis </PERSON> said the main thrust of the Cossiga talks with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was prospects for peace in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, the upcoming elections in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> and reforms in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Cossiga </PERSON>, speaking on the White House lawn before his meeting with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, urged more financial assistance to help those political changes succeed. `` I'm thinking in particular of the great Polish nation that is currently in the throes serious difficulty in its courageous attempt to work its renewal and which needs more substantial aid from us,'' he said. <PERSON> Seitz </PERSON> told reporters that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Cossiga </PERSON> `` waxed philosophical about East-West issues and the importance of defense throughout this period of change in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>.'' Later at a state dinner, the American president lauded the friendship between <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, saying the ties have `` never been stronger'' and paying tribute to the `` new <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>'' as a `` great and growing economic power, one of the world's foremost democracies, a strong and valued ally and a partner in the community of free nations. <PERSON> Cossiga </PERSON> said western nations were under an obligation to encourage reform in the Eastern Bloc countries, and members of the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Common </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Market </ORGANIZATION> `` intend to redouble their efforts to establish a climate of ever greater mutual confidence and to restore increasingly close economic cultural and human relations throughout the <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> continent.''

<TEXT>
 A top-ranking member of the <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> cocaine cartel who resorted to plastic surgery to avoid arrest was captured and will face extradition to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, police said Wednesday. Meanwhile the reputed leader of the cartel, the largest in the world, reportedly asked the <LOCATION> Colombian </LOCATION> government to begin peace talks with drug traffickers. <PERSON> Pablo </PERSON> <PERSON> Escobar </PERSON> also said in the reported letter that news reports of previous government negotiations with drug lords were true. The <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION> daily <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Espectador </ORGANIZATION> temporarily closed its <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> office after drug lords killed two of the newspaper's employees there and threatened to murder the bureau's remaining staff of 11. An executive of the anti-drug crusading newspaper said officials will study how to improve office security. The <ORGANIZATION> Administrative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said the suspected drug trafficker who was captured, <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Abello </PERSON> <PERSON> Silva </PERSON>, was arrested Tuesday in a <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION> restaurant. The office said in a communique that he had undergone facial surgery to avoid easy detection. It also said <PERSON> Abello </PERSON> is the fourth-ranking person in the <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> cocaine cartel and the most important suspect arrested since <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> began cracking down on cocaine lords Aug. 19. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Harri </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kramer </PERSON> said a federal grand jury in <LOCATION> Tulsa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Okla. </LOCATION>, indicted <PERSON> Abello </PERSON> in 1987 on charges of conspiring to import and distribute cocaine. <PERSON> Kramer </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> had requested that <PERSON> Abello </PERSON> and a suspect arrested Wednesday, <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Palma </PERSON>, be held for extradition. Palma is wanted by federal authorities in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> on charges of interstate travel in aid of racketeering in connection with an operation to launder drug money, <PERSON> Kramer </PERSON> said. Details of <PERSON> Palma </PERSON>'s arrest were not immediately available from <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> police. Neither Palma nor <PERSON> Abello </PERSON> is on the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s list of 12 most wanted traffickers, but the department has said it wants dozens of other Colombians on federal drug charges <PERSON> Cornelius </PERSON> <PERSON> Dougherty </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, said in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> <PERSON> Abello </PERSON> was responsible for `` major shipments of cocaine and marijuana into the states.'' <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Administrative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Abello </PERSON> was the cartel's chief of operations for <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s northern coast, where dozens of clandestine air strips are used to smuggle 300 to 400 tons of cocaine into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> each year. The federal police force said legal documents from the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government for extraditing <PERSON> Abello </PERSON> were being processed. So far <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> has extradited one suspected trafficker; four, including <PERSON> Abello </PERSON>, are awaiting extradition. A letter reportedly signed by <PERSON> Escobar </PERSON> and delivered to the director of a <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION> newspaper asked for mediation by the press, political and church leaders and the judicial branch in a `` direct dialogue'' between the government and the drug traffickers. The letter reportedly was addressed to <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Pastrana </PERSON>, director of <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prensa </ORGANIZATION> newspaper, and the text was read in a broadcast by the national radio network <ORGANIZATION> Caracol </ORGANIZATION>. `` In the same way that war decrees can be issued so can peace decrees be issued,'' <PERSON> Escobar </PERSON> said, refering to the hard-line measures against drug traffickers adopted by President <PERSON> Virgilio </PERSON> <PERSON> Barco </PERSON> after the Aug. 18 assassination of a leading presidential candidate. As part of the decrees, <ORGANIZATION> Barco </ORGANIZATION> revived <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s extradition treaty with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and confiscated hundreds of millions of dollars in property believed to belong to drug lords. <PERSON> Escobar </PERSON>, the presumed leader of the <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> cartel _ the largest in the world _ heads the list of drug suspects wanted by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. He is listed by <ORGANIZATION> Forbes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> magazine </ORGANIZATION> as one of the 20 wealthiest men in the world with a fortune exceeding $ 2 billion. The letter attributed to <PERSON> Escobar </PERSON> said the drug lords and the government first began talking before Sept. 1, 1988, when <PERSON> Barco </PERSON> included the traffickers in a peace plan originally offered only to <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s leftist guerrillas. The president never specifically indicated that drug traffickers would be included, and government officials have repeatedly said they never considered talking with the drug lords. La Prensa recently reported that <PERSON> Barco </PERSON>'s closest adviser, <PERSON> German </PERSON> <PERSON> Montoya </PERSON>, had received messages from the traffickers seeking a truce beginning in September 1988. <PERSON> Montoya </PERSON> later admitted meeting once with the man carrying the messages, former Interior Minister <PERSON> Joaquin </PERSON> <PERSON> Vallejo </PERSON>, but said he did so without the president's knowledge. He said he told <LOCATION> Vallejo </LOCATION> from the beginning that a dialogue was not possible. <LOCATION> Vallejo </LOCATION> said, however, that he met numerous times with <PERSON> Montoya </PERSON> and that the contacts ended two days after suspected drug traffickers assassinated Sen. <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Galan </PERSON> Aug. 18. The newspaper <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Espectador </ORGANIZATION> closed its office in <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> after an anonymous caller said the Extraditables _ a group of cocaine traffickers _ had killed the two employees Tuesday and would kill the others in <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> if the office remained open. `` <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Espectador </LOCATION> declares that it will be able to survive as a free newspaper only if the government fulfills its obligation to protect our lives and properties,'' the paper's directors said in a letter sent to Interior Minister <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Lemmos </PERSON> <PERSON> Simmonds </PERSON>. A spokeswoman for the minister's office said there had been no official response to the letter. <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Espectador </LOCATION> has been the most vociferous of <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s newspapers in editorials calling on the government to crush the nation's drug trade

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Rezsoe </PERSON> <PERSON> Nyers </PERSON> of the new <ORGANIZATION> Hungarian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> declared on Wednesday that `` at present, there is no communist party in <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>,'' although `` there are communists.'' In an interview with <ORGANIZATION> Hungarian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> TV </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Nyers </PERSON> rejected claims by orthodox communists opposed to the establishment of the new party that the old party continued to exist. The presidium of the <ORGANIZATION> Hungarian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> held its first meeting on Wednesday as conservative communists apparently kept up efforts to revive the disbanded <ORGANIZATION> Hungarian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- communist -RRB- Party. <PERSON> Nyers </PERSON> was chairman of the communist party. He was elected <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> president at a key party congress this weekend that voted the old communist party out of existence and founded the new one. He said membership of the party had `` become confused'' by the change. Hungarian radio said 43 communists in the industrial center of <LOCATION> Csepel </LOCATION>, just south of <LOCATION> Budapest </LOCATION>, announced `` they are going to continue to organize the HSWP and -LRB- are -RRB- calling on all chapters to follow suit.'' They said the delegate they sent to the party congress `` was not authorized to abandon Marxism-Leninism,'' the radio reported. <PERSON> Nyers </PERSON> conceded it was `` likely -LRB- they -RRB- ... will organize a communist party.'' But, he said, `` those who agree with the <ORGANIZATION> HSWP </ORGANIZATION> line and want to continue must organize a new party. I do not think they can use the name HSWP.'' If the word `` new'' or `` original'' were added to the name, however, then it `` would be acceptable,'' he went on. The English-language <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Budapest </LOCATION> said Wednesday former party ideologist <PERSON> Janos </PERSON> <PERSON> Berecz </PERSON> confirmed he wants `` to stay on'' as a member of the old communist party. <PERSON> Karoly </PERSON> <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON>, secretary-general of the party until it was dissolved, repeatedly has said he wished to remain a member of the old party. The independent daily <PERSON> Mai </PERSON> <PERSON> Nap </PERSON> quoted <PERSON> Berecz </PERSON> as saying Tuesday, `` We are staying in the HSWP and I hope that a significant segment of the membership will do likewise.'' Also on Tuesday, the state news agency <ORGANIZATION> MTI </ORGANIZATION> said the extreme leftist Marxist Unity Platform was encouraging communists to rejoin the old party. Another radical leftwing group, the <ORGANIZATION> Ferenc </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Muennich </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>, is also known to strongly oppose dissolution of the communist party. <PERSON> Nyers </PERSON> said the new 25-member presidium at its meeting Wednesday discussed lower level organization, the fate of party-controlled assets and of the Workers' Militia, the old party's paramilitary body. He replied when asked about expected membership of the new party that it was `` impossible to say'' how many of the old party's 720,000 members would want to belong He speculated it could be between 50 and 70 percent.

<TEXT>
 A key <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> committee decided by acclamation Wednesday to hold a special <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> session on fighting the international drug traffickers. The <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>'s general committee decided without debate or dissent to have the entire assembly take up the issue Tuesday and decide when the special session should be held. Most diplomats expect the session to be held in February. Since nearly all of the 159 members of the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> have delegates on the general committee, approval of the anti-drug special session is assured. The General Assembly seized the initiative after a British effort to have the <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> deal with the issue was withdrawn after many developing nations opposed council involvement in a social concern. <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> particularly opposed the expansion of the <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> into areas other than the military aspect of security, said diplomats, speaking on condition of anonymity. <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s President <PERSON> Virgilio </PERSON> <PERSON> Barco </PERSON> won a standing ovation from the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> on Sept. 29 when he called on all nations to ratify the 1988 <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> Convention on Narcotics Trafficking, which closes legal loopholes giving drug dealers safe haven in some countries. The treaty, strongly backed by <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, requires nations to make drug trafficking illegal, confiscate dealers' property and bank accounts and extradite drug lords even if there is no applicable extradition treaty. Twenty nations must ratify the treaty before it comes into effect. So far, only the <LOCATION> Bahamas </LOCATION> has done so and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> are considering signing. About 100 countries have signed the treaty, the first step toward ratification.

<HEAD>Road Work Leads To Removal Of Obelisk Dedicated to White Supremacy</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW ORLEANS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The Liberty Monument, a Reconstruction-era obelisk dedicated to white supremacy, is being removed from downtown <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>' main street to make room for road construction, city officials say. The stone monument stands in the middle of Canal Street near the Rivergate Convention Center has been the target of civil rights complaints for years. The obelisk is being removed to improve access to the <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> ferry and the Aquarium of the <LOCATION> Americas </LOCATION>, which is scheduled to open next year. The marker will go into storage, officials said Tuesday. It was erected to commemorate the so-called the Battle of Liberty Place, fought nearby on Sept. 14, 1874. The White League, a group of prominent whites angered by alleged corruption in the state's biracial Republican government, fought the <ORGANIZATION> Metropolitan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION>, which supported the Reconstruction regime. One source places the day's casualties at 27 killed and 105 wounded. The White League won the day, but Reconstruction was not finally ended and white `` home rule'' restored until 1877. The cornerstone of the monument was laid in 1891. For many years, wreath-laying ceremonies were held there each Sept. 14. In the 1970s, blacks demanding the monument's removal criticized inscriptions added to it in 1932 extolling white supremacy. In 1974, a plaque repudiating the references to white supremacy was added to the monument. In 1981, <PERSON> Dutch </PERSON> <PERSON> Morial </PERSON>, the city's first black mayor, tried to have the memorial torn down, but his efforts were blocked by the City Council. The controversial inscriptions were removed. Streets Department Director <PERSON> Betty </PERSON> <PERSON> Jo </PERSON> <PERSON> Everett </PERSON> said she did not inform Mayor <PERSON> Sidney </PERSON> <PERSON> Barthelemy </PERSON> or the City Council before ordering the monument removed. She said a decision on its fate will be up to a committee that oversees all city monuments.

<HEAD>Homosexuals Hold `Coming-Out' Day</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 Hundreds of gay men and women across the nation celebrated their sexuality with rallies, films and discussions Wednesday on the second annual `` National Coming Out Day.'' `` National Coming Out Day is great. It's like a holiday,'' said <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheek </PERSON>, executive assistant at the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> Gay and <ORGANIZATION> Lesbian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, where about 500 people gathered. The celebration at the center included discussion of such films as `` The Life and <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Harvey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Milk </ORGANIZATION>,'' about <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>'s murdered gay city supervisor Cheek said the day's highlight was an open microphone at which people could tell their own stories of coming out _ gay slang for publicly acknowledging one's homosexuality. `` Some were funny, but there were a lot of tear-jerkers,'' he said. `` We had a lot of first-timers.'' In <LOCATION> Providence </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> R.I. </LOCATION>, about 50 people attended a rowdy Statehouse rally and said they hoped to inspire tens of thousands of others to acknowledge their homosexuality. None of the demonstrators was `` coming out of the closet'' for the first time, organizers said. Most were veterans of other gay pride events, and they said the real coming-out process is one that's done privately. `` My coming out was when I opened the dictionary at age 14 and looked up the word ` homosexual' and realized that applies to me,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Blakeslee </PERSON>, 34, of <LOCATION> Providence </LOCATION>. At the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Amherst </LOCATION>, students were asked to wear black or pink to support the celebration. Black, always a popular choice of students, proliferated on campus by mid-morning. `` This campus is so diverse, civility and being aware of social issues is really important,'' said <PERSON> Max </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, a senior and president of the school's Lesbian Bisexual and Gay Alliance. In <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> gave all but final approval Wednesday to a bill banning discrimination against homosexuals in housing, credit and employment. The bill, which has died in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> for each of the last 17 years, moved along after <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Bulger </PERSON> ruled that amendments offered by several opponents were merely delaying tactics. `` This really is the people's victory,'' <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> LaFontaine </PERSON> of the Coalition for Lesbian and Gay Civil Rights. `` We are going to herald this as a major step forward in the civil rights movement.'' The Atlanta Gay Center sponsored a help-line and bought local advertising to commemorate a homosexual rights march in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> two years ago. Gay residents had their names printed in the ads as part of the commemoration. North of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Marin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supervisors </ORGANIZATION> voted 4-0 to proclaim Wednesday `` Marin Coming Out Day,'' despite protests by evangelical ministers that the county should not be endorsing gay lifestyles. <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Searle </PERSON>, pastor at <ORGANIZATION> Marin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Life </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Novato </LOCATION>, said he was `` very disappointed'' because the board's action `` will be perceived by the community as an endorsement of the lifestyle.'' Supervisor <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Aramburu </PERSON>, one of two who wore `` Coming Out'' buttons, said the proclamation reflects a `` spirit of respect.'' `` I think we respect one another as human beings,'' he said. Cheek said holding the annual day helps end homophobia by letting the heterosexual world know that there are gays and lesbians all around them. `` If you find out your next door neighbor that you've known all along is gay, then how can you hate him?'' Cheek said.

<HEAD>Cable Industry Warning of Rerun Blackout</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAY ARNOLD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Some aging but still popular TV shows may fade from the nation's cable systems in January, and the cable industry wants customers to know who's to blame _ the government. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cable </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> is providing cable systems with short announcements warning viewers that shows such as `` Cheers,'' `` Mork and <PERSON> Mindy </PERSON>,'' and `` Hee-Haw'' may disappear after Jan. 1. The reason is the return of `` syndex,'' industry jargon for the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> regulations that allow local, over-the-air television stations exclusive rights to the syndicated, non-network programs they show in their market. The <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> is reinstating the rules it lifted in 1980 as a way to boost the then-infant cable industry. If the rules survive pending court challenges, some reruns may disappear completely in some cities. That could happen if cable systems, forced to black out some time slots from `` distant'' stations that carry the same programs as local broadcasters, decide to drop the out-of-town stations entirely. Cable operators, fearing a backlash from viewers, are using the announcements as a pre-emptive strike to make sure customers knows it's not their fault. <PERSON> Preston </PERSON> <PERSON> Padden </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Independent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stations </ORGANIZATION>, is a proponent of reinstating the syndex rules. `` Our entire constitutional copyright system is based on recognizing and honoring contracts between creators and exhibitors,'' <PERSON> Padden </PERSON> said. But <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Simmons </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, says the rules are `` terribly unfriendly to consumers.'' <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON>, whose company has 350,000 subscribers in 20 states, said broadcasters have indicated they will claim exclusivity for programs such as `` The Oprah Winfrey Show,'' `` Who's the Boss?', `` Hee-Haw,'' `` <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> and <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>,'' `` The A-Team,'' `` Wheel of Fortune,'' `` M.A.S.H.,'' `` I Love <PERSON> Lucy </PERSON>,'' `` Golden Girls,'' `` A Current Affair,'' `` <PERSON> Donahue </PERSON>,'' `` Amen'' and `` Mork and <PERSON> Mindy </PERSON>.'' Those shows would be carried on only one station in any market, <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON> said in a telephone interview from his <LOCATION> Stamford </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, office. `` The requirements could have such an impact that a cable company, rather than have a subscriber sit there and watch essentially Swiss cheese ... may just decide to drop the channel altogether,'' <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON> said. The rules would affect national `` superstations'' such as <ORGANIZATION> WTBS </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> WGN </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> WWOR </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and so-called regional TV stations such as <ORGANIZATION> WPIX </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> KTLA </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. Turner Broadcasting System, which owns <ORGANIZATION> WTBS </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Turner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cable </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION>, said <ORGANIZATION> WTBS </ORGANIZATION> would be `` syndex-proof.'' TBS is telling cable operators it will indemnify them against any syndex problems. `` We've already made arrangements to have a blackout-free schedule,'' <PERSON> Bert </PERSON> <PERSON> Carp </PERSON>, a TBS official in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, said in a recent interview. He said <ORGANIZATION> TBS </ORGANIZATION> had managed to either acquire national exclusivity for its programs or acquire new programs.

 Veteran labor leader <PERSON> Saul </PERSON> <PERSON> Ubaldini </PERSON> was voted out of office Wednesday in a political victory for President <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Menem </PERSON>. The secretary-general of the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Confederation </ORGANIZATION> was unseated at a rowdy congress punctuated the day before by fistfights and clashes between rival union members wielding iron bars, clubs, chains, bottles and stones. <PERSON> Guerino </PERSON> <PERSON> Andreoni </PERSON>, leader of the commerce workers union, was elected to replace <PERSON> Ubaldini </PERSON> as head of the 3 million-member confederation. Most of the members work at state companies, including the national airlines and railroad, which have been losing tens of millions of dollars annually for years. <PERSON> Ubaldini </PERSON> had been considered a rival capable of undermining <PERSON> Menem </PERSON>'s economic policy. <PERSON> Menem </PERSON> has held down workers' wages as a way to halt inflation, which soared by 197 percent in July, the month he took office. The September increase was 9.4 percent. The president also pressured state rail workers to end a strike last month, and caused concern among state employees about their jobs and benefits by pledging to sell money-losing public companies to balance the budget. <PERSON> Ubaldini </PERSON> insisted he did not oppose <PERSON> Menem </PERSON>, but always stressed his independence. `` Nothing and no one will impede our fight'' to improve workers' welfare, he said on Aug. 17, hours after his car was damaged by a bomb During the 1983-89 presidency of <PERSON> Raul </PERSON> <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON>, which ended in July, <PERSON> Ubaldini </PERSON> organized 13 general strikes and pressed for increases in the national minumum wage, public programs to reduce unemployment and a halt to payments on <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>'s foreign debt. <PERSON> Menem </PERSON> had tried to oust <PERSON> Ubaldini </PERSON> since his labor-based <ORGANIZATION> Peronist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> swept presidential and congressional elections May 14, offering the trade unionist a high-level post in an overseas embassy, among other things. But the beer workers union chief, who has led the labor confederation since 1980, refused. <PERSON> Menem </PERSON> made no immediate comment on <PERSON> Ubaldini </PERSON>'s ouster, nor did Labor Minister <PERSON> Jorge </PERSON> <PERSON> Triaca </PERSON> or their ally in the trade union movement, foodworkers union chief <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Barrionuevo </PERSON>. But soon after the confederation's entire 20-member board of directors was replaced late Wednesday, <PERSON> Barrionuevo </PERSON> told reporters he briefed <PERSON> Menem </PERSON> on the development and Government House officially recognized the new confederation leadership. <PERSON> Ubaldini </PERSON>'s term does not expire until February 1990, and the fiery unionist pledged to stay on until then. `` We have not resigned,'' he told cheering, chanting supporters gathered outside confederation headquarters in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Telmo </LOCATION> neighborhood near <LOCATION> Buenos </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aires </LOCATION>' port. `` The secretary general continues to be me.'' In an editorial titled `` Labor At the Crossroad,'' the English-language <ORGANIZATION> Buenos </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aires </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION> newspaper criticized the scuffles that broke out Tuesday outside the convention hall where 1,600 confederation delegates gathered. `` At stake is whether the government can continue to tame the inflation which has fallen from nearly 200 percent in July to single digits in September, or whether a wage offensive spearheaded by <PERSON> Ubaldini </PERSON> ... will drive a coach and horse through government incomes policy,'' it said.

 Suspended Navajo Tribal Chairman <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON> was accused of 111 criminal charges Wednesday, including bribery, fraud, conspiracy and elections violations while he led the nation's largest Indian tribe. Special prosecutors hired by the <ORGANIZATION> Tribal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> filed a five-pronged complaint in <ORGANIZATION> Navajo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Window </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rock </LOCATION>, the tribal capital, after a four-hour review of the charges by Judge <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Yazzie </PERSON>. Shortly before the charges were disclosed, <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON> denounced them as `` baloney.'' `` They are the same old laundry that they've been hanging out for the last year and a half,'' he told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> later, after learning of the specific charges. One complaint charges <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON> with 27 counts of bribery, fraud, ethics violations and conspiracy in the tribe's $ 33.4 million purchase of the Big Boquillas Ranch in northern <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> in July 1987. Allegations that <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON> personally profited from the ranch purchase emerged in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee testimony earlier this year. A second complaint alleges 25 violations of the Navajo election law, including charges that <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON> accepted $ 115,500 in undocumented cash and service constributions from non-Indians and corporations. A third charges <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON> with 59 counts of bribery, extortion, fraud, ethics violations and conspiracy in alleged fradulent consultant contracts <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON> purportedly entered into with outside businesses from November 1986 through 1989. Prosecutors allege he pocketed over $ 300,000. If convicted on all 111 counts, <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON> could be sentenced to 15 years in tribal jail and fined as much as $ 59,500. <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON>'s son <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> `` Rocky'' <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> is charged with conspiracy in the ranch purchase in a fourth complaint and tribal Vice Chairman <PERSON> Johnny </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> is accused of ethics violations in the fifth. Prosecutors did not break down the complaints against <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> or the younger <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON>. Court officials said people listed in the complaint would probably receive summonses from the <ORGANIZATION> Navajo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> within 14 days. The special prosecutors, members of the <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fe </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.M. </LOCATION>, law firm of <PERSON> Rothstein </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>, <PERSON> Daly </PERSON>, <PERSON> Donatelli </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON>, were appointed by the <ORGANIZATION> Tribal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> in March to `` investigate any possible wrongdoing by former and current tribal officials,'' said tribal spokesman <PERSON> Duane </PERSON> <PERSON> Beyal </PERSON>. <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON>, speaking to reporters in this north-central <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> community shortly before the contents of the charges were disclosed in <LOCATION> Window </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rock </LOCATION>, 150 miles southeast, said the charges would be trumped-up. `` I do n't care what it is, it's going to be a bunch of baloney and whatever court it goes to it's going to be proven its a bunch of baloney,'' <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON> said. He reiterated his claim that the federal government wanted to oust him and other strong Indian leaders so it could have easier access to minerals and other natural resources on reservations. `` We have made mistakes, I'm sure,'' <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON> said. `` But we have nowhere near as bad a record as whites have as our trustees in bringing poverty and hunger and illiteracy and alcoholism to native Americans. `` We have nowhere near the record of whites in stealing Indian land, Indian oil, Indian coal, Indian gas, and Indian water,'' he said. Special prosecutor <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Rothstein </PERSON>, who released the contents of the complaint, said 75 to 100 people were investigated, including members of the administrations of <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON> and interim Chairman <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> <PERSON> Haskie </PERSON>. <PERSON> Haskie </PERSON> said the tribe appointed the prosecutors to `` protect the best interest of the <LOCATION> Navajo </LOCATION> people'' and file charges if warranted. He said he had has asked the federal government to expedite its investigation of <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON>. That probe focuses on allegations made during the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee testimony in January that <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON> and his family profited from the tribe's purchase of the 491,000-acre ranch. The council put <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON> on administrative leave with pay on Feb. 13. On March 10, it named <PERSON> Haskie </PERSON> interim chairman and placed <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> on leave. <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON> has said the 88-member council acted illegally by replacing a chairman without a two-thirds majority, but tribal courts have upheld the actions. At his news conference, <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON> declined to answer questions about past allegations. `` I'm exercising my rights,'' he said when asked why he had resisted turning over documents sought by tribal and federal investigators. Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> <PERSON> Stooks </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION> did not return a phone call for comment on the status of the federal investigation. The tribe purchased the Big <LOCATION> Boquillas </LOCATION> from <ORGANIZATION> Tracey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Gas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, which had bought it a short time earlier from <LOCATION> Tenneso </LOCATION> <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> for $ 26.2 million. The tribal complaint alleges that <PERSON> Tracey </PERSON>, <PERSON> Byron </PERSON> `` Bud'' <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, the broker, and <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON> agreed to divide the $ 7.2 million profit among themselves. It further alleges that <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON> concealed the ranch's true value from the tribe and used his position as chairman to inflate the ranch's appraised value, speed the sale and conceal his personal gain. Earlier this year, the tribe filed suit in <ORGANIZATION> Maricopa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION>, seeking to recover $ 24 million in damages from <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON> and others in the ranch purchase.

 A company can not hide behind a `` corporate veil'' to avoid funding the cleanup of a toxic chemical spill caused by a subsidiary, a federal judge ruled Wednesday in one of the first such cases in the country. <ORGANIZATION> Kayser-Roth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s tight control over subsidiary <ORGANIZATION> Stamina </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mills </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> makes it liable to pay $ 846,492 to clean up a 1969 release of trichlorethylene, or TCE, that the government contends contaminated nearby drinking wells, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Boyle </PERSON> ruled. `` Kayser-Roth had the power to control the release or threat of release of <ORGANIZATION> TCE </ORGANIZATION>, had the power to direct the mechanisms causing the release, and had the ultimate ability to prevent and abate damage,'' <PERSON> Boyle </PERSON> wrote. <PERSON> Deming </PERSON> <PERSON> Sherman </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Kayser-Roth </ORGANIZATION>'s attorney, and <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> lawyer <PERSON> Cynthia </PERSON> <PERSON> Huber </PERSON> said they believed it was the first Superfund case prosecuted by the federal government in which a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> judge made a parent corporation liable for the actions of its subsidiary. <ORGANIZATION> Kayser-Roth </ORGANIZATION>, a hosiery and apparel manufacturer, argued it could not be forced to pay because it was protected from liability by a `` corporate veil'' that shielded it from the acts of its subsidiary, which operated a now-defunct woolen mill in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Smithfield </LOCATION>. The corporate veil, a long-established legal doctrine, protects investors in new ventures from losing all their assets and is a major reason that most business activities are carried on by corporations. The veil is rarely pierced, and only when a parent company is shown to have overwhelmingly controlled its subsidiary. The judge said <ORGANIZATION> Kayser-Roth </ORGANIZATION> fit that category because of its total control over <ORGANIZATION> Stamina </ORGANIZATION>'s finances, its order that Stamina refer environmental matters to <ORGANIZATION> Kayser-Roth </ORGANIZATION>'s legal department, and its approval of all Stamina real estate deals and capital purchases greater than $ 5,000. <PERSON> Boyle </PERSON> also said <ORGANIZATION> Kayser-Roth </ORGANIZATION> executives served as most of Stamina's officers and directors. `` Kayser-Roth has exhibited overwhelming pervasive control over <ORGANIZATION> Stamina </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mills </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Boyle </PERSON> wrote. The judge said he was concerned primarily with furthering the Superfund law's intent to let the government collect the cleanup costs in hazardous waste cases. The law `` attempts to address nationwide public health and environmental problems'' and `` places no special importance upon the corporate structure,'' <PERSON> Boyle </PERSON> wrote. <PERSON> Sherman </PERSON> called it `` a pretty broad opinion'' and said he believed <ORGANIZATION> Kayser-Roth </ORGANIZATION> would have case law on its side if it decided to appeal. The Wall Street Journal recently reported that three federal judges in the past five months, including <PERSON> Boyle </PERSON>, had declined to dismiss cases based on corporate veil arguments. An agreement in principal had been reached to settle one of those cases, against <ORGANIZATION> T </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> N </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION>, an English holding company, the newspaper said. The government has sought to pierce the corporate veil because parent companies often have greater resources to pay for hazardous waste cleanups than do their subsidiaries. <PERSON> Boyle </PERSON> also rejected <ORGANIZATION> Kayser-Roth </ORGANIZATION>'s argument that the government could not prove the wells were contaminated by <PERSON> Stamina </PERSON> <PERSON> Mills </PERSON>. `` On this record it is sheer speculation to suggest that there was any other source of <ORGANIZATION> TCE </ORGANIZATION>,'' the judge said. The judgment includes $ 660,612 to the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> and $ 185,879 to the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Kayser-Roth </ORGANIZATION> also will be liable for any future cleanup costs at the Stamina site, <PERSON> Boyle </PERSON> wrote.

 <PERSON> Pablo </PERSON> <PERSON> Escobar </PERSON> <PERSON> Gaviria </PERSON>, the reputed leader of the largest cocaine cartel in the world, reportedly sent a letter to the director of the newspaper <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prensa </ORGANIZATION> Wednesday asking for helping in arranging peace talks with the government. <PERSON> Escobar </PERSON> heads the list of Colombian drug traffickers wanted by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The following is a translation by The AP of the letter, read over the national radio chain Caracol: -LRB- 1 -RRB- The conversations between us and the government began many days before the government offered its peace proposal to the <LOCATION> Colombian </LOCATION> people. -LRB- 2 -RRB- Present at the conversations were those of us mentioned by the national and international press. We made various proposals and expressed our point of view in several different meetings. -LRB- 3 -RRB- In those meetings, we complained of the abuses committed against our innocent families, of the arbitrary detentions of our elderly and our women, of the repressive raids, of the confiscations and all the other types of outrages. -LRB- 4 -RRB- We also let the government know that we have not been, nor will be, ready to permit these types of infamous violations of all of our rights. -LRB- 5 -RRB- We also raised the issue of a Colombian peace founded on a direct dialogue with the commanders of the country's different -LRB- army -RRB- brigades, with the commanders of the different guerrilla groups, with the commanders the paramilitary and self-defense groups, with the representatives of the emerald miners and with the leaders of the different groups of extraditables. One of our own ideas, the text of one of our own phrases, was included in the text of the president's Sept. 1, 1988, speech concerning his peace plan. Mr. Director: For the sake of peace we ask publicly for your mediation and for the mediation of the other directors of the country's important newspapers. We ask publicly for the mediation of the <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>, and for the participation of the political class, the judicial powers represented by their unions and magistrates. We ask publicly for the participation of the government and the public promise of guarantees, both physical and judicial, for the participants in the direct dialogue in the search for peace.

Colombian peace is more important than the considerations and conceptions of the other governments of the world. <PERSON> Pablo </PERSON> <PERSON> Escobar </PERSON> <PERSON> Gaviria </PERSON>

 A man was arraigned Wednesday on two counts of murder in the killing of two prostitutes, but police said he was not a suspect in the slayings of four other <ORGANIZATION> Oakland </ORGANIZATION> prostitutes in the last three months. <PERSON> Dewain </PERSON> <PERSON> Hall </PERSON>, 26, did not enter a plea during a brief appearance before Municipal Court Judge <PERSON> Horace </PERSON> <PERSON> Wheatley </PERSON>.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday refused to take up a measure that would have ordered the <ORGANIZATION> Census </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> to exclude illegal aliens from next year's census. It was a test of strength that pitted <ORGANIZATION> Sunbelt </ORGANIZATION> states whose populations have been swollen by illegal aliens against <PERSON> Frostbelt </PERSON> states that stand to lose <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> seats after the census. By 232-184, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> used a parliamentary maneuver steered by Rep. <PERSON> Silvio </PERSON> <PERSON> O. </PERSON> <PERSON> Conte </PERSON>, R-Mass., to keep the census measure off the floor That was the vote by which the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> instructed its negotiators in <ORGANIZATION> House-Senate </ORGANIZATION> talks to accept a provision in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> version of the State, <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> and Commerce appropriations bill to condemn the continuation in power of Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. The rules permit only one set of instructions to a conference committee. Thus Rep. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Ridge </PERSON>, R-Pa., was blocked from offering his own set of instructions on the census question to the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> members of the same committee Ridge's provisions would have ordered the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> negotiators to accept another Senate-passed provision, this one to barring the use of any money for the <ORGANIZATION> Census </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> to count illegal aliens in its 1990 head count. The census bureau has always counted residents regardless of citizenship. Past efforts to exclude illegal aliens from the count have always died in committee. The matter is important to several northeastern and midwestern states which expect to lose <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> seats in redistricting following that census. Under current census rules, <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, with many illegal aliens, expect to gain House seats while <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> are among those expected to lose seats. Even though it was apparent they would not have a chance to get a vote on the <LOCATION> Ridge </LOCATION> proposal, backers of the census change used the hour devoted to the <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> censure to debate the census issue. Ridge and others characterized it as a matter of political fairness. `` I want equal representation for <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> citizens,'' argued Rep. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Goodling </PERSON>, R-Pa. Opponents argued that any change in census rules at this point would cost $ 1 billion, including the cost of reprinting forms and retraining the enumerators. They said it was not clear that the census-takers could even get accurate information on citizenship. Rep. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Ford </PERSON>, D-Ky., called it, `` A fantasy'' that states losing seats could save any by excluding aliens from the count Opponents have said the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> provision is clearly unconstitutional, since the Constitution requires a census of `` persons.'' When the Constitution wants something to apply only to citizens, it clearly says `` citizens,'' according to this argument. Supporters have argued that the Constitution gives <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> the power to impose rules for the Census.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s major opposition party, was challenged in <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday to reply to allegations that it tilted in favor of the pinball industry after being fed sizeable donations. <PERSON> Koichi </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamada </PERSON>, a legislator of the governing <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION>, cited a published report that eight Socialists helped water down legislation regulating pachinko, a widely played form of pinball in which winners receive prizes. The weekly magazine <ORGANIZATION> Shukan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bunshun </ORGANIZATION> said the eight received donations from a national association of pachinko parlor owners ranging from $ 1,400 to $ 3,500. <PERSON> Hamada </PERSON>, whose own party was badly hurt at the polls this year by a major influence-peddling scandal, addressed his questions to the justice minister during <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> debate in the lower house. `` There have been allegations that some legislators have acted to protect the -LRB- pachinko -RRB- industry while they were not supposed to do so,'' he said. `` I will not name them right now, but the issue involves something to be called the second Recruit scandal.'' By Recruit <PERSON> Hamada </PERSON> was referring to a scandal in which leading politicians and bureaucrats received donations or cut-price stock shares from <ORGANIZATION> Recruit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, a major information services conglomerate accused of trying to influence government policy. Bribery charges have been filed in that case. The justice minister replied he was aware of the allegations and assumed that prosecutors were interested in the case. <PERSON> Tsuruo </PERSON> <PERSON> Yamaguchi </PERSON>, Socialist secretary-general, has acknowledged that some party members received donations from the pachinko association, including $ 31,000 for party chairwoman <PERSON> Takako </PERSON> <PERSON> Doi </PERSON>, but said all the donations were legal. The magazine said donations to Ms. <PERSON> Doi </PERSON>, known to be a pachinko fan, were in the form of ticket purchases for parties in her honor. The Recruit scandal and an unpopular new 3 percent sales tax were major factors in the <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION>' losing their majority in <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>'s upper house for the first time in 34 years in elections in July. The Socialists were the major gainers in the election. About 15,000 pachinko parlors operate across <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, with annual sales estimated at nearly $ 21 billion, <ORGANIZATION> Shukan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bunshun </ORGANIZATION> said. To help in investigating any tax evasion by the pachinko industry, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> has sought to introduce a system in which customers would use prepaid cards, rather than cash, to play pachinko machines. Socialist legislators strongly opposed such a system.

<HEAD>80 Bodies Of Sinhalese Youths Found</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PATRICK CRUEZ</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The bound bodies of 80 Sinhalese youths, all shot and some set on fire, were found along a southern road on Wednesday and authorities blamed pro-government death squads. No one claimed responsibility, but authorities speculated the killings were the work of death squads out to avenge the ambush slayings of three Sinhalese soldiers in the district on Monday. The bodies were discovered one day before the government and opposition parties wrap up monthlong peace talks aimed at resolving <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>'s ethnic differences. More than 16,000 people have died in the strife. The bodies were found in groups of six or eight along a 20-mile stretch of road between <LOCATION> Panadura </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Mataguma </LOCATION>, said police officials, who could not be identified under briefing rules. The towns are in <LOCATION> Kalutara </LOCATION> district, about 25 miles south of <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION>. Officials said the victims were aged 18 to 30. Their hands were tied behind their backs and the bodies bore gunshot wounds. Some bodies were afire, they said. The ambush on Monday was blamed on Sinhalese militants of the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, a group trying to topple the government for two years now. Human rights groups and opposition parties allege that vigilante groups are killing sympathizers of the front, a charge denied by President <PERSON> Ranasinghe </PERSON> <PERSON> Premadasa </PERSON> and his government. A Foreign Ministry official said Wednesday that a team of the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> will arrive Oct. 17 on an invitation by <PERSON> Premadasa </PERSON> to monitor human rights practices in <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>. The official, who also could not be identified under briefing rules, said the Geneva-based body will send a preliminary team. He had no details. Officials have said about 25 people a day are being killed in the battle between Sinhalese radicals, the military and death squads. Independent groups say the government encouraged the vigilantes after the military failed to put down Sinhalese extremists. The front began attacking the Sinhalese-dominated government after it signed a peace accord in July 1987 designed to give greater autonomy to the island nation's Tamil minority. The accord followed six years of Tamil insurgency in the <LOCATION> northeast </LOCATION> where most Tamils live and want to set up a separate homeland. The insurrection has claimed 11,000 lives. Tamils make up 18 percent of <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>'s 16 million people. They allege discrimination in jobs and education by the Sinhalese, who make up 75 percent of the population and control the government and the military. Last month <PERSON> Premadasa </PERSON> convened a peace conference of 21 of the country's 27 recognized political parties. It was boycotted by the front. The conference is due to hold its final round of talks Thursday.

 <PERSON> Denis </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldberg </PERSON> no longer feels uneasy in a crowd. But whenever he sits down to write his memoirs, the recollections of 21 years in a South African prison still overwhelm him. He served the longest prison term imposed on a white militant, and now is in his fifth year in British exile. But he says the ideals that got him, <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> and six other black nationalists locked up for plotting to overthrow the white-led minority government made his life sentence bearable. `` I did n't count every day I was in prison, but I calculated it,'' <PERSON> Goldberg </PERSON>, now 56, says in an interview. `` I was there 7,904 days. I do n't regret one day, it was worth it. `` I certainly do not repudiate my past actions. I do not repudiate the armed struggle _ I think it's essential.'' At 29, <PERSON> Goldberg </PERSON> was an engineer turned bomb-maker for the <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, the banned black nationalist movement. He was arrested at an <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> hideout in <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION> and given three life sentences in June 1964 for `` campaigning to overthrow the government by violent revolution.'' Deported in 1985 after undertaking not to participate in political violence, he now runs the <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION>'s mail order business in north <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> selling mostly T-shirts and posters. He lectures occasionally in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and abroad. On Tuesday, President F.W. <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON> said he will free five of <PERSON> Goldberg </PERSON>'s co-defendants, including <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> political strategist <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Sisulu </PERSON>, but not <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>. The other co-defendant, <PERSON> Govan </PERSON> <PERSON> Mbeki </PERSON>, was freed in 1987. <PERSON> Goldberg </PERSON> calls their release `` a public relations exercise to show <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON> is amenable to change.'' It took <PERSON> Goldberg </PERSON> two years to adjust to freedom in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. Finally, one morning, `` suddenly I felt at ease; The crowds did n't bother me. `` There's a lot of softness and gentleness outside that is enriching,'' he says. `` It sounds corny but it's very, very true. I find life incredibly exciting, fulfilling and worthwhile.'' His wife <PERSON> Esme </PERSON>, 60, says: `` Prison made him tender.'' But the memories of prison run deep. `` I find that when I do sit down to write about it, I simply do n't sleep,'' he said. `` A recollection of one incident brings back a whole chain of incidents and events, and I find that this just overwhelms me.'' The former engineer said he gradually was driven to violence by revulsion for apartheid, the race-separation system under which 5 million whites disenfranchise 28 million blacks. He's chubbier now and losing his hair, and his quirky humor masks a deep hurt at having missed seeing his two children grow up. His son, <PERSON> David </PERSON>, was 8 and his daughter, <PERSON> Hilary </PERSON>, 5 when he left <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION> in May 1963, intent on fleeing abroad. A bomb had exploded in his garden, obscenities were painted on his car and police were clamping down on dissidents. He stayed on briefly to organize arms production for the <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION>. `` Had I not been arrested, I would have gone on to start production of land mines and grenades and timing devices and so on,'' he says. `` Bomb-maker is a pejorative term. My people said that what I was doing was just and justified.'' <PERSON> Goldberg </PERSON> served most of his sentence in the whites-only <LOCATION> Pretoria </LOCATION> Prison. `` In a country where prison is the norm in the lives of most black South Africans, it was perhaps a way of identifying,'' he said. `` That we could survive and come out relatively whole people is really a victory over people who try to smash us.'' He first visited his daughter at a kibbutz in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> before flying to <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, where his wife and son moved during his trial. <PERSON> Goldberg </PERSON> said his son, who in 1985 was 29 and married with children, `` needed me to tell him I had n't left him.'' `` I told him I did n't see how I could ever make my family above all other families,'' he says. `` Kids suffer and starve not because their parents are politically active, but that's the nature of apartheid, and I felt I had to do something.'' His eyes reddened with emotion behind horn-rimmed glasses. `` I've had some suffering. So! Lots of people have died. People are getting hanged, people are getting shot. I'm alive. Life's great.

Members of <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, who have a 142-100 majority in the house, shouted back, trying to drown out opposition members chanting `` Corrupt <PERSON> Rajiv </PERSON> <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>, resign, resign.'' The opposition legislators walked out when the house chairman, Vice President <PERSON> Shankar </PERSON> <PERSON> Dayal </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharma </PERSON>, said he would permit a discussion on the newspaper report but would not summon <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>. They returned 90 minutes later when <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> entered to read a statement on creating 1 million new jobs throughout the country, and drowned most of his 30-minute speech in continuous slogan-shouting and catcalls. The Hindu, a Madras-based daily, said in a front-page story Monday that there was new evidence to prove kickbacks were paid in the $ 1.4 billion deal to purchase <ORGANIZATION> Bofors </ORGANIZATION>' howitzer guns. Newspapers have alleged that <ORGANIZATION> Bofors </ORGANIZATION> paid $ 50 million to clinch the contract and that some of the money went to senior members of the government. <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> has repeatedly denied the charges. The allegations were first made in 1987 but have re-surfaced in recent months as the usually fractious opposition tries to form a coalition in an effort to unseat <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> in national elections due by January. The opposition's efforts to focus public attention on the issue have included the resignations of 100 <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> members from the 542-seat lower house, or <LOCATION> Lok </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sabha </LOCATION>, in August. The resigning members claimed the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> was using its majority to stifle discussion on the <ORGANIZATION> Bofors </ORGANIZATION> gun deal. Monday's article in The Hindu said secret portions of a report by the Swedish <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Audit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> reveal that at least $ 31 million were paid to a Panama-based company, whose majority owner was the Indian agent of <ORGANIZATION> Bofors </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION>. The article said the Indian and Swedish government's appeared to have colluded in keeping that portion of the report secret and releasing a `` sanitized'' version. The newspaper printed photocopies of what it said were the withheld portions of the report. Next to the photocopies, The Hindu reprinted three public comments of <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> reiterating that no Indian had received money from the Swedish company.

 Three men facing charges in the world's largest cocaine seizure were denied bail Wednesday by a judge who citied a substantial risk of flight by the three, one of whom is a professional pilot <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Magistrate <PERSON> Volney </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> agreed with prosecutors that <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> McTague </PERSON>, 41, of <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paso </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Mauricio </PERSON> <PERSON> Monroy </PERSON>, 36, of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>; and <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON> <PERSON> Fernando </PERSON> <PERSON> Castillon </PERSON>, 32, of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, had no reason to remain here. A separate bail hearing was set for Thursday for <PERSON> Miguel </PERSON> <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> <PERSON> Chavez </PERSON>, 34, <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. Pending indictment, all four men face a federal complaint of possession of cocaine with intent to distribute. They were arrested in the Sept. 28 seizure of what officials say was 21 tons of cocaine, which has since been destroyed, and about $ 12 million in cash discovered at a warehouse in suburban <LOCATION> Sylmar </LOCATION>. It was the largest seizure of cocaine on record. One defense attorney tried to close the bail hearing to the news media and another launched an attack on the chain of custody for their clients, who had faced state charges before being handed over to federal authorities. `` A lot of local politicians and officials have ridden on the backs of these defendants to enhance their careers,'' said attorney <PERSON> Marlene </PERSON> <PERSON> Gertz </PERSON>, representing <PERSON> Castillon </PERSON> and <PERSON> Monroy </PERSON>, the pilot. `` There's been lots of publicity, and this publicity has been very detrimental,'' she said in arguing for a closed hearing. `` This bad publicity will continue unless the press is excluded. The press has already convicted these defendants.'' <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> denied the motion without comment, along with a motion by <PERSON> McTague </PERSON> lawyer <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Pancer </PERSON> to dismiss the charges because the change from state to federal custody was `` an unnecessary and improper delay.'' Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> said that with several agencies involved in the investigation, officials needed time to sort out the proper jurisdiction for prosecution. County prosecutors dropped charges Friday against the four men so they could face charges in federal court where drug conviction penalties are stricter. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> set a hearing date of Oct. 24 and a post-indictment arraignment on Oct. 30 for all four defendants in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. Also Wednesday, prosecutors gave an account of how much cocaine was seized at the warehouse. Federal agents and local police said the haul from the warehouse weighed 42,800 pounds, including packaging. They subtracted about 800 pounds for packaging, leaving 21 tons. <PERSON> McTague </PERSON> is the brother-in-law of <PERSON> Hector </PERSON> <PERSON> Tapia </PERSON> <PERSON> Anchondo </PERSON>, 38, one of the alleged leaders of the smuggling operation. Authorities said <PERSON> McTague </PERSON> also identified the mastermind of the drug ring as <PERSON> Rafael </PERSON> <PERSON> Munoz </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Juarez </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Tapia </PERSON> and <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Tapia </PERSON> <PERSON> Ponce </PERSON>, 68, father of <PERSON> Tapia </PERSON> <PERSON> Achondo </PERSON>, were arrested in <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION> on Saturday in connection with the cocaine find. <PERSON> Munoz </PERSON> remains at large.

 Just as the abortion battle intensifies in the courts and statehouses, some political observers and population experts say the issue is bound to become an irrelevant relic, overtaken by technology. They say the `` abortion pill'' in growing use in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> inevitably will reach <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, legally or illegally, and forever change the argument: women who want abortions will have them without having to visit clinics, possibly without doctors _ and maybe even without knowing whether they are pregnant. To anti-abortion forces, the French pill is a cloud on the horizon. It comes as the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> faces another opportunity to overturn its 1973 decision that legalized abortion and as <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> legislators meet in the nation's first special session on abortion since the high court in July gave states additional power to regulate abortions. `` People on either side of the argument are spending a lot of energy and emotion on a political issue that's going to be defused,'' says <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Cole </PERSON>, who teaches in the Science, <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Program </ORGANIZATION> at <ORGANIZATION> Rutgers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J </LOCATION>.

 Nostalgia videos _ taped television shows and even commercials from the 1950s and'60s _ have found an ever-growing market since <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Video </ORGANIZATION> introduced `` Star Trek'' on tape in 1985. With unit sales for various `` Star Trek'' episodes on tape approaching 4 million, others in the video business have beamed aboard. Now almost every kind of old program is on tape, from familiar titles such as `` The Honeymooners,'' `` The Lone Ranger'' and `` I Love Lucy'' to cult shows like actor <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> McGoohan </PERSON>'s abstract `` The Prisoner.'' Outfits like <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> CBS-Fox </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Video </ORGANIZATION> have access to a wide library of shows. Paramount is considering the original `` Mission Impossible,'' `` The Untouchables,'' and `` <PERSON> Mannix </PERSON>,'' as well as more recent items like `` Mork and <PERSON> Mindy </PERSON>.'' CBS is looking at `` Batman,'' `` Gunsmoke,'' `` <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> Five-O'' and `` Rawhide.'' <PERSON> Arny </PERSON> <PERSON> Schorr </PERSON>, the vice president and general manager of <ORGANIZATION> Rhino </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Records </ORGANIZATION>, says the much-targeted baby boomers seem to be most willing to part with their money for nostalgia videos. `` They're the people who grew up with the stuff, and it brings back comfortable memories,'' <PERSON> Schorr </PERSON> said. `` Also, if they have very young children, they know its OK to put ` The Lone Ranger' on. They know nobody is going to get killed and the good guys are going to win.'' <PERSON> Rhino </PERSON>'s video department is an arm of retrospective specialists <ORGANIZATION> Rhino </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Records </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. It has such titles as `` The Lone Ranger'' and `` Sgt. <PERSON> Preston </PERSON> of the Yukon'' along with `` <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramjet </PERSON>,'' the late 1960s cartoon series filled with adult asides, `` Death Valley Days,'' with stars including <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Clint </PERSON> <PERSON> Eastwood </PERSON>, and `` <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Gunn </PERSON>,'' the popular detective series with its driving <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Mancini </PERSON> theme song. MPI Home Video has tracked the cult favorites, including a recently discovered batch of `` The Honeymooners'' episodes and `` The Prisoner,'' starring <PERSON> McGoohan </PERSON> as a secret agent who resigned only to be a captive in a seaside village. Both shows, said <ORGANIZATION> MPI </ORGANIZATION> Vice President <PERSON> Jaffer </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON>, are good examples of what clicks in the nostalgia video market. `` <PERSON> Jackie </PERSON> <PERSON> Gleason </PERSON> has been popular for 35 years in ` The Honeymooners,' and its safe to say that 35 years from now, <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Kramden </PERSON> will still be funny,'' he said. `` ` The Prisoner' was not very successful in syndication, but it was a huge hit for us. There was a real following.'' `` It's almost a new kind of syndication, a video syndication,'' said <PERSON> Ali </PERSON>. At the end of October, <ORGANIZATION> MPI </ORGANIZATION> plans to release five-episode tapes of the gothic soap opera `` Dark Shadows.'' Because vampire <PERSON> Barnabas </PERSON> <PERSON> Collins </PERSON>, the show's most popular character, did not appear until eight months into the series, the first `` Dark Shadows'' tape will include a special half-hour sequence outlining plot developments that took place before the <PERSON> Collins </PERSON> character was introduced. `` There is another ingredient, and that is cult status. There are ` Dark Shadows' and ` Prisoner' and ` Honeymooners' fan clubs,'' said <PERSON> Ali </PERSON>. `` We recognize that as a hard-core base that we can build on.'' Most of the nostalgia videos are priced from $ 10 to $ 20 for sale directly to consumers rather than rental stores, and even such giants as <ORGANIZATION> CBS-Fox </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Video </ORGANIZATION> have found that television advertising for mail orders _ or using catalogues _ increases sales for nostalgia videos. Taking even a quirkier step into nostalgia is <ORGANIZATION> Video </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, whose founder <PERSON> Ira </PERSON> <PERSON> Gallen </PERSON> has turned his nostalgia film collecting and research efforts into six volumes of `` Kid's Commercials Of The'50s and'60s'' and 18 other volumes on commercials `` I've been collecting films since I was 16,'' <PERSON> Gallen </PERSON> said. `` There is not a school or museum in the country that has the full version of the history of TV commercials.'' <PERSON> Gallen </PERSON> said he makes most of his finds by contacting private collectors, along with the original producers, directors and writers. Among his more recent acquisitions: RCA commercials with the late <PERSON> Vaughn </PERSON> <PERSON> Monroe </PERSON>; Choo-Choo Charlie chugging along with Good and Plenty candies; and <ORGANIZATION> Hertz </ORGANIZATION> putting folks in the driver's seat.

<HEAD>Suddenly, South Africans Take Note of Their Ecology</HEAD>

 Suddenly, the ecology has become a dominant topic in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. In recent weeks, tens of thousands of people nationwide have signed petitions denouncing industrial threats to the environment and the country's first ecology-oriented political party has come into being. A host of environmental problems confront <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, ranging from air pollution to water shortages, but two events in particular have galvanized the public into action. First came disclosure of plans by a British-owned company to mine titanium in the scenic sand dunes around <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lucia </LOCATION>, an estuary and game reserve northeast of <LOCATION> Durban </LOCATION> on the <LOCATION> Indian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION>. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Clarke </PERSON>, environment writer for The Str newspaper in <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION>, describes the area as `` one of the world's most beautiful and biotically rich places.'' About 200,000 South Africans have signed petitions opposing the mining project, and government officials have said they will ask the company, <ORGANIZATION> Richards </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bay </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Minerals </ORGANIZATION>, to reassess the environmental impact of its plans. In September, an outcry arose when chemicals leaked into a river in eastern <LOCATION> Transvaal </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Province </LOCATION> from a huge paper mill, killing tens of thousands of fish and disrupting water supplies for more than 200,000 people. Residents in the politically conservative area near <LOCATION> Kruger </LOCATION> <LOCATION> National </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> started their own petition drive, demanding government action against the <ORGANIZATION> Sappi </ORGANIZATION> paper company and expressing `` dismay and outrage'' at apparently lax safety measures. Within days after the chemical spill in the <LOCATION> Crocodile </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, environmentalists met in <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION> to form the <ORGANIZATION> Ecology </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, which has adopted a green heart as its symbol. <PERSON> Colin </PERSON> <PERSON> Slater </PERSON>, a marketing consultant who helped found the party, said he had lived in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> during the emergence of the Greens movement and hoped the <ORGANIZATION> Ecology </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> could play a similar role in forcing South African politicians to pay more attention to ecological issues. In the past, most environmental organizations in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> focused on singular issues. Several groups have promoted wildlife conservation, for example, and others opposed the use of nuclear power by the state-run electricity monopoly. But environmental awareness among the general public was relatively low. One reason was that South Africans aligned against the government and big business concentrated on fighting apartheid. `` Resistance and opposition to the government and industry have been dominated by the burning issues of racism and exploitation, leaving little time and energy for organization around ecology,'' wrote labor specialists <PERSON> Eddie </PERSON> <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dirk </PERSON> <PERSON> Hartford </PERSON> recently in The Weekly Mail, an anti-apartheid newspaper. But <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Hartford </LOCATION> suggested that ecologists and anti-apartheid activists could find common ground in opposing pollution, the misuse of pesticides and the dumping of toxic wastes. Other commentators have suggested that the black majority would take a much keener interest in the environment if whites, who control 87 percent of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s territory, agreed to a major redistribution of land. The Ecology Party's <PERSON> Slater </PERSON> said the environment has suffered neglect because of `` the tremendous day-to-day emphasis on black-white politics.'' `` But we feel that hopefully the black-white political problem is reaching a resolution,'' he said in an interview. `` When blacks and whites are finally holding hands, let's make sure it's not in a desert.'' The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> government, in power since 1948, is viewed by many environmentalists as a halfhearted ally, committed in principal to environmental protection but often reluctant to act, possibly because industrial growth is needed to provide jobs for the fast-growing black population. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Glavovic </PERSON>, an environmental law expert at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Natal </ORGANIZATION>, says the government has steered away from tough anti-pollution laws, instead giving its environment minister broad discretionary powers. `` <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> is in many respects still a developing country,'' <PERSON> Glavovic </PERSON> said. `` The government clearly does n't want to overregulate or curtail operations so that this starts impacting on economic growth.'' The environment is the topic of a new book by <PERSON> Clem </PERSON> <PERSON> Sunter </PERSON>, a corporate consultant who specializes in forecasting what lies ahead for <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. The book, `` South African Environments into the 21st Century,'' says droughts, floods, locust plagues, sandstorms and fires in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> during the 1980s were aggravated by shoddy conservation practices. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> `` had to pay the price for over a century of careless environmental management and its unique experiment in social engineering -LRB- apartheid -RRB-,'' <PERSON> Sunter </PERSON> writes. He argues that the environment will be saved only through a combination of sustained economic growth, curtailment of the birth rate and political stability. `` People must be educated about the importance of safeguarding the interests of future generations by protecting the environment today,'' he writes. `` Wiping the slate clean of apartheid is one thing ... but what replaces it is even more important.''

<HEAD>Ousting Noriega Would be a Tricky Enterprise</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Whatever the odds on <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s lease on power in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, they have to be heavily against the kind of tidy, tied-down coup the administration seems to envision as a way to get rid of him. After the coup that failed, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> sounds more willing than the administration to take risks _ or at least to encourage President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to take them _ provided they pay off in the ouster of the Panamanian military boss. But stripping a strongman of his power is a risky enterprise, with no guarantees. It does not lend itself to scripts written in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> for execution without peril to American forces and interests. Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> said the administration would want better conditions and a better atmosphere in order to commit American forces to a future move against <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said the message sent to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> commanders at the time of the Oct. 3 coup attempt was to go ahead with support `` if there were an opportunity to do this without risking bloodshed and significant loss of American life and to do so without open military involvement ...'' In congressional debate about what went wrong and who's to blame there has little talk about the risks involved in promoting or aiding an attempt to topple <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> by force, and then arrest him on two <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> drug trafficking indictments. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> has withstood 2 -LCB- years of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> efforts, under two administrations, to push him out with economic and diplomatic sanctions. An earlier coup attempt was crushed, as was the attempt of a <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> president to dismiss him. He canceled the results of an election after it had been held because it was going against him. Sanctions were stiffened and reinforcements sent to the 12,000-man <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> garrison in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. The Organization of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> tried to negotiate the peaceful transfer of power to a democratic government, without success. So much for persuasion. That leaves force. Intervention in support of the coup attempted by dissident members of the <ORGANIZATION> Panama </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> could have led to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> casualties. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> argues that American lives should not be put at risk on the basis of `` somebody else's plan and somebody else's schedule. Then again, a coup attempt based on a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> plan and timetable would have built-in liabilities. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> already claims his opponents are <ORGANIZATION> Yankee </ORGANIZATION> lackeys bent on helping the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> hold onto the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION>. Open intervention would stir trouble elsewhere in <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and could strengthen opponents of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bases elsewhere. Although the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> is reviewing the way it is set up to gather information and make decisions in times of crisis, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s spokesman said that is because of concern about the process, not because of second thoughts about using <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces in support of the coup attempt White House Press Secretary <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said baloney to the suggestion that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> did n't get the information he needed on which to base a decision. `` He made the decision he thought was best and the decision we still think is right,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said Tuesday. Nor, he said, is there any change in the administration's policy of encouraging the Panamanians to oust <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, despite the critics who say that carried with it some obligation to help rebellious officers who tried to do the job. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has suggested repeatedly that the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> Defense Forces get rid of the general, saying the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has no quarrel with the organization, only with <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> and his cadre. He repeated that message the day after the aborted coup. `` And we'll continue to speak out in that area,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. Administration officials have been doing so. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON>, the White House chief of staff, said in a Saturday interview on Cable News Network that he thinks <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> will be ousted within six months. `` If you want odds, I'd say 8 to 5 that he probably will be out,'' <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> was n't quoting odds, but he said the pressure will stay on. `` And we're not going to rule out the use of force, either force that we ourselves plan totally and directly or force in conjunction with some other operation,'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said Sunday on <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s Meet the Press Administration spokesmen fanned out to the network talk shows as <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was criticized from both the right and the left for failing to order <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military action in support of the coup. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> approved a measure expressing support for efforts by the president to `` use the full range of appropriate diplomatic, economic and military options'' to protect Americans, guard the canal, remove <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> and restore constitutional government. Republicans complained that some Democrats who had opposed intervention in other crises were retroactively endorsing it in the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> coup. `` Failure is the father of about a hundred hawks on Capitol Hill now,'' said Sen. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Maine </LOCATION>.

 `` Time is money.'' Though that proverb dates to ancient history, repeated over the centuries by sages like <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON> <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> and <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Dickens </PERSON>, it is by no means worn out. In fact, in an era of two-income families, convenience stores, fax machines and microwave ovens, it has taken on new relevance as one of the most common, and important, principles people apply to the business of their daily lives. A `` service economy'' like that of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> today provides more and more situations in which you can, or must, exchange one of those valued commodities for the other. So the questions naturally arise: How much is your time worth in dollars? And, by no means incidentally, how much are your dollars worth in time? For most people who work for wages or salaries, one quick answer to that question is available from the stub on your last paycheck: $ 5 an hour, or $ 10, or $ 50, or $ 500. Perhaps overtime gets you time-and-a-half, or 50 percent more. Similarly, anyone with a hand-held calculator can estimate the `` time value'' of his or her money. If you invest $ 3,650 at a 10 percent yield in a one-year certificate of deposit, the bank pays you about about $ 1 a day for the use of your money. But the reckoning gets more complicated once you start to deal with problems involving more variables that are harder to quantify. For example, what is the net income your household realizes from a second job that requires extra expenses for day care, transportation and convenience foods? How much return per hour do you actually get from clipping and filing supermarket coupons? And how high must the hourly labor rate charged by a plumber or electrician go before it behooves you to take on the labors, and risks, of home repairs yourself? Often, of course, necessity makes the decision for you. If you lack the money, you find the time somehow. If an urgent mission is beyond your time and skills, you endeavor to scrape up the money somewhere. Still, even in cases like these, there can be tradeoffs involved. Suppose you have a household problem for which you must hire a contractor. By the traditional wisdom, notes <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Reed </PERSON> in his newsletter Real Estate Investor's Monthly, you should get estimates from at least three contractors before you hire one for the job. To get the best possible price, you might even call in every contractor in your area. The more exhaustive your selection process, though, the more time you are likely to spend trying to save money. Cases like this give you an opportunity to perform an instructive exercise. If you keep track of the money saved and the time spent on a given project, you can simply divide the dollar amount of savings by the number of hours you put in. The result of that one-step calculation gives you the value in dollars per hour you have set for yourself on your time. Conversely, if you pay someone else to tackle something you might have done yourself, you can divide the extra expense by your estimate of how many hours of work you saved. That tells you how much money you are willing to spend in exchange for an hour of your time.

<TEXT>
 If you examine an economist carefully, you generally will find an individual who believes inflation is one of the great threats to mankind _ not just to man's economy, but to his existence. They have good reasons for the feeling, because inflation not only corrupts the currency but eventually erodes quality, morality, ambition, contracts, values and responsibilities at individual, group and governmental levels. Still, not all economists put inflation at the top of their lists of things to avoid. There is another group that says constant worry and maneuvering to avoid inflation can produce equal or worse consequences. Those two groups are now fighting it out, and it could be a slugfest. In one group is a White House that sees economic growth as a more important goal than inflation fighting. In the other is the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION>. They are n't likely to identify themselves as opponents, because conflict tends to cause too much excitement in the marketplace, but the scrap will be hard to disguise. These are two heavyweights. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>, had made clear his position that inflation is the bigger threat, and his actions suggest that he is even willing to incur a mild recession in order to keep it submerged. <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> has n't just recently joined the anti-inflation group. Back in the mid-1970s he chaired an anti-inflation commission for President Ford that campaigned on the WIN ticket _ Whip Inflation Now. Critics forgive him for that, because double-digit inflation was a scourge of the 1970s, rising to double-digit levels that, while making some people rich, disrupted markets, threatened banking stability and destroyed savings. <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON>'s timing was less forgivable, since the WIN campaign was launched while the nation's economy was about to plunge into a recession, which for limited practical purposes can be called the opposite of inflation. Ever since becoming <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> chairman in the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration, <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> has continued to signal his fear of inflation. While many economists celebrated inflation of less than 5 percent, <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> said it was n't enough. In July 1988, when some economists were discussing the economy's slow growth, <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> that unemployment was nearing its lower limit and industrial capacity its upper limit When those limits are reached, a true inflation fighter knows that interest rates must be raised. <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> saw to it, and over the next four months the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Funds </ORGANIZATION> rate increased a full percentage point to 8.5 percent. Whether <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> saved the economy from inflation will be debated forever; more important was the perception that he viewed the economy as too hot when some of his brother economists thought it was somewhat cool. Rather than raising interest rates, some of these colleagues argued, should n't the country seek to expand its capacity? Expanded capacity, new equipment and more efficient plants also could remove an inflation threat. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Yardeni </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Prudential-Bache </ORGANIZATION> economics director, expressed the latter view late in 1988. If <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> tightened too much, he said, he could abort the capital spending needed `` to expand capacity he fears there is n't enough of.'' This week, <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> seemed to issue another warning, advising people not to expect easier money in the interest of expanding the economy. He said in effect that the bigger threat is still inflation rather than recession.

<HEAD>Negotiating Pastors Challenging Methodist Tradition of Itineracy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BRIGGS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 The Rev. <PERSON> Lester </PERSON> <PERSON> Meyer </PERSON> remembers the phone call he received one Saturday from another pastor wondering when <PERSON> Meyer </PERSON> and his family were going to move out so he could move in. The other minister was embarrassed to learn <PERSON> Meyer </PERSON> had no idea he had been transferred, but a generation ago it was not unusual for the bishop to order a pastor to pull up stakes within a few days and move to another outpost in the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Methodist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>. Now a member of the hierarchy himself, <PERSON> Meyer </PERSON> finds the centuries-old tradition of the itineracy _ in which ministers are guaranteed jobs for life in return for going where they are sent _ under challenge from clergy who no longer can or want to uproot their families to serve a small, rural church or a poor urban church. `` Formally, they still take the same vow. Practically speaking, there is a different philosophy,'' said <PERSON> Meyer </PERSON>, district superintendent of the <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> District </LOCATION>, part of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Methodists </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oklahoma </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION>. `` The autocratic assignment process simply would not work in the present social times.'' The 9 million-member church that once operated on the principle that `` a pastor always has a church, a church always has a pastor'' has had to adjust to the advent of clergy couples and working spouses and to theological changes stressing the partnership of bishops and clergy. The future of the itineracy is being weighed by a Commission for the <ORGANIZATION> Study </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>. It began work in 1984 and expects to produce a preliminary report early next year. The final report is to be presented before the 1992 General Conference, the church's chief policy-making body. The issue is not unique to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Methodist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>. In the <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>, bishops have been consulting more frequently with priests and parishes on clergy assignments in the last 20 years, said the Rev. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Brinkmoeller </PERSON>, executive director of the Secretariat for Priestly Life and <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bishops </ORGANIZATION>. `` It's a theological conviction'' that everyone has some understanding of God's will, not just the bishops, <PERSON> Brinkmoeller </PERSON> said. United Methodist Bishop <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Blake </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>, vice-chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>, said the hierarchical ministry is being phased out in many churches. `` I think what is happening in the itineracy is sort of symbolic of what's happening in the church in general,'' <PERSON> Blake </PERSON> said. `` Collegiality, throughout the church, is replacing hierarchy and competition.'' In addition, pastors and their families have more at stake today when considering a move. The ordination of women, for example, has produced the corresponding phenomenon of clergy couples. There are about 600 clergy couples among the more than 38,000 ordained ministers in the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Methodist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>. The rise in two-income families also has decreased mobility as spouses veto moves too far from present jobs. <PERSON> Meyer </PERSON> estimates 80 percent of the clergy in his area have working spouses. But <PERSON> Brinkmoeller </PERSON> says `` the rub in the system'' of greater consultation on personnel moves is that few changes are currently possible; jobs in inner cities and remote areas still must be filled. Some Episcopal bishops, in a recent `` Excellence in Ministry'' report for the church, `` commented sardonically that there was no job shortage in some of the less attractive jobs in remote areas and the inner cities.'' Some within the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Methodist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> are concerned that giving clergy veto power over jobs would make it more difficult to fill less attractive positions, while the large, well-off churches could shop around for the best and the brightest clergy. Nearly two-thirds of <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Methodist </ORGANIZATION> congregations have fewer than 200 members. What happens in practice, <PERSON> Meyer </PERSON> said, is that `` lesser qualified'' clergy are sometimes appointed to rural churches. <PERSON> Blake </PERSON> said there is a tension within clergy between their call to be in ministry and `` careerism,'' which he defined as a `` gross national product'' understanding of vocation that equates bigger with better. In <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, Methodists have dealt with the issue by standardizing clergy salaries. Proposals to do the same in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> have consistently been defeated, but <PERSON> Blake </PERSON> said the issue will not go away. `` That is on the table. We must resolve it,'' <PERSON> Blake </PERSON> said. `` If the guiding principle of one's ministry is one's career, that is not theologically or ecclessiastically defensible.''

<HEAD>Reports Say Auto Giants Volvo and Renault to Join</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> AB </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Volvo </ORGANIZATION> said it is holding discussions with <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Renault </ORGANIZATION>, although it would not confirm published reports that the automakers were in final negotiations for a merger or joint venture. The business magazine <ORGANIZATION> Veckans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affarer </ORGANIZATION>, in its Wednesday edition, said it had confirmation from sources at <ORGANIZATION> Volvo </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Renault </ORGANIZATION> and the Swedish government of the merger talks. `` We are conducting talks about cooperation with <ORGANIZATION> Renault </ORGANIZATION>, but I do n't want to comment on their content, on which level the talks are being held and the possible timing,'' <PERSON> Krister </PERSON> <PERSON> Goransson </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Volvo </ORGANIZATION>'s information director, said Tuesday. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Clifford </PERSON>, a spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> Volvo </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, said the company had confirmed that <ORGANIZATION> Volvo </ORGANIZATION> was talking with <ORGANIZATION> Renault </ORGANIZATION> and with <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Empresa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nacional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> de </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Autocamiones </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> SA </ORGANIZATION>, although he had no further information about the topic of discussion. <ORGANIZATION> Renault </ORGANIZATION>'s information chief, <PERSON> Olivier </PERSON> <PERSON> Cochet </PERSON>, confirmed in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> to the Swedish news agency <ORGANIZATION> TT </ORGANIZATION> that negotiations were taking place between the French government-owned carmaker and <ORGANIZATION> Volvo </ORGANIZATION>. `` Renault aims to break its isolation before 1992 and is looking for a partner to bring costs down,'' <ORGANIZATION> TT </ORGANIZATION> quoted <PERSON> Cochet </PERSON> as saying. But the talks with <ORGANIZATION> Volvo </ORGANIZATION> were similar to talks <ORGANIZATION> Renault </ORGANIZATION> was having with other automaking concerns, <PERSON> Cochet </PERSON> told the Swedish agency. The new concern would have 250,000 employees and revenue of about $ 39 billion, Veckans Affarer stated. <ORGANIZATION> Volvo </ORGANIZATION> has been seeking to safeguard its position in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> once the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> establishes open borders in 1992, because <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION> has said it would not ask to join the community. <ORGANIZATION> Volvo </ORGANIZATION> is by far <LOCATION> Scandinavia </LOCATION>'s largest company in the private sector, reporting a pre-tax profit last year of $ 1.3 billion. Aside from cars, trucks and buses, <ORGANIZATION> Volvo </ORGANIZATION> has diversified into food, marine and industrial motors, aerospace and trading. <ORGANIZATION> Volvo </ORGANIZATION> is the general agent for <ORGANIZATION> Renault </ORGANIZATION> cars and light trucks in <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Volvo </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Hans </PERSON> <PERSON> Rehnstrom </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> the talks with <ORGANIZATION> Renault </ORGANIZATION> were not initiated because of 1992.

 Interest rates on short-term <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> securities fell in Tuesday's auction. The <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> sold $ 7.4 billion in three-month bills at an average discount rate of 7.63 percent, down from 7.83 percent last week. Another $ 7.4 billion was sold in six-month bills at an average discount rate of 7.60 percent, down from 7.92 percent last week. The rates were the lowest since three-month bills sold for 7.54 percent on Nov. 7, 1988, and six-month bills averaged 7.35 percent last July 31. The new discount rates understate the actual return to investors _ 7.89 percent for three-month bills with a $ 10,000 bill selling for $ 9,807.10 and 8.01 percent for a six-month bill selling for $ 9,615.80. In a separate report, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday that the average yield for one-year <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bills, the most popular index for making changes in adjustable rate mortgages, fell to 8.35 percent last week, down from 8.38 percent the previous week.

 <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> says it will evaluate heat-sensitive food packaging materials designed for microwave cooking to determine whether new safety regulations are needed. The <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> is asking for information about heat susceptors, metalized surfaces in the packages of food intended for microwave cooking. These heat susceptors absorb microwave energy and become very hot, allowing the food to become brown and crisp. Because the susceptors become so hot, the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday it is concerned that other parts of the package, including adhesives, polymers, paper and components of plastic films, may migrate into the food at high levels. The <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> has regulations governing the safety of packaging materials that contain substances that could migrate into food, but the agency said that at the time many of the rules were written these materials were not commonly used at temperatures above 300 degrees Fahrenheit. Heat-susceptor packaging can raise the temperature to more than 500 degrees Fahrenheit. The <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> said it does not have enough data to determine whether at these high temperatures the packaging materials are safe. It is asking the industry and the scientific community to submit information the agency can use to consider amending the regulations for food packaging.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Integrated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a struggling financial concern, was dealt another blow when <ORGANIZATION> Whitehall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> said it could not obtain financing to buy Integrated's core financial services businesses. Integrated also said Tuesday that <ORGANIZATION> Whitehall </ORGANIZATION> was seeking a `` significant adjustment'' in the $ 310 million purchase price and proposed to pay for the business partly with securities in the new core group. The snag raises further doubts about Integrated's ability to make payments on some $ 1.75 billion in debt. Integrated has not paid any principle or interest to bondholders since June, when it said it would have to default because of worsening troubles stemming from its difficulty in diversifying out of real estate into financial services businesses. <ORGANIZATION> Whitehall </ORGANIZATION>, a family-owned partnership, had reached a tentative agreement in August to buy <ORGANIZATION> Integrated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Life </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Integrated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Equity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Integrated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Asset </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Clearing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. After the spinoff of subsidiaries, Integrated's main business would be management of existing public and private limited partnerships and real estate investment trusts Integrated, once a high-flying real estate investment concern, said it was continuing negotiations with <ORGANIZATION> Whitehall </ORGANIZATION> and `` is also engaged in serious discussions with another party.'' Integrated said it still wants to reach an agreement to sell the core businesses by Sunday. Integrated had said it would try to sell its core financial service companies for $ 450 million to $ 525 million, but <ORGANIZATION> Whitehall </ORGANIZATION> was interested in only part of the holdings. The $ 310 million price was put at $ 20 million to $ 30 million below the low end of the desired price for the financial businesses. Integrated also said it had agreed to pay <ORGANIZATION> Whitehall </ORGANIZATION> a $ 4 million breakup fee of the deal was dropped. <ORGANIZATION> Whitehall </ORGANIZATION> is half-owned by members of the de Gunzburg branch of the <PERSON> Bronfman </PERSON> family of <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, heirs to the <ORGANIZATION> Seagram </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION> distilling fortune, and half-owned by the <PERSON> Moross </PERSON> family of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, which has extensive financial services interests. <ORGANIZATION> Whitehall </ORGANIZATION> has holdings in life insurance and property and casualty brokerage.

<HEAD>Britain Suddenly Finds Itself in an Economic Crisis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By COTTEN TIMBERLAKE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> suddenly has found itself in an economic crisis, with high inflation, high interest rates and a growing trade deficit returning despite the 10-year <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> revolution. A recent move by the government to hike interest rates to 15 percent, the highest level in eight years, might plunge <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> into a recession, the government's critics warn. The pound is falling sharply despite the interest rate increase, and stock prices are sinking on the prospect of yet another rate hike. `` There's no doubt about it. We are in a crisis,'' said <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> <PERSON> Knapp </PERSON>, a British economist at the <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> investment firm <ORGANIZATION> Barclays </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> de </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Zoete </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wedd </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION> `` You're talking about the possibility of the <LOCATION> U.K. </LOCATION> going into a recession. That has n't happened since 1981-1982.'' Said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Webb </PERSON>, a lecturer on economics at the <ORGANIZATION> London </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economics </ORGANIZATION>: `` It is quite a serious problem. The economy is going to have to take some pretty harsh medicine over the next few months.'' Among the victims are homeowners, who have seen mortgage payments rise steadily through 11 official interest rate hikes over the past 17 months. The government insists the problems arise from success, not failure _ that the inflation now running at an annual rate of 7.3 percent stems from an economy that grew too fast in the boom years of Thatcherism. It points out that inflation and interest rates are still below those it inherited when <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> took office as prime minister in 1979. But the crisis has put Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> on the defense in the midst of its annual convention this week. An agenda that was supposed to dwell on the triumphs of Thatcherism is now likely to be dominated by the economic problems. Meanwhile, the opposition <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> is looking like a credible alternative for the first time in years. It's ahead in the polls, has formally dumped many of its old vote-losing policies, and is looking with increasing confidence toward mid-1992, the deadline for <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s next general election. Despite the current troubles, the <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> government maintains that fighting inflation is its priority, and high interest rates the weapon, no matter how unpopular. Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> told party members at a pre-conference dinner Monday night: `` The economy is stronger than ever The interest rate rise was necessary and this government always does what is necessary and always has.'' Just months ago, the government was credited with curing <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s long-term economic disease of high inflation and high interest rates. It boasted of the longest period of economic growth since World War II, fiscal prudence, and a long-declining unemployment rate, now at 6.1 percent. <PERSON> Nigel </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawson </PERSON>, who slashed income tax rates, was being hailed as one of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s greatest-ever chancellors of the exchequer, the government's chief fiscal officer. So what went wrong? `` Basically, the chancellor let the economy grow too strongly for too long,'' <PERSON> Knapp </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Lawson </PERSON>, fearful of recession, allowed interest rates to stay too low after the October 1987 stock market crash, the economist said. Instead, consumer spending and investment, already strong, grew further, spurring inflation, the economist said. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s industry warns that its profits, jobs and competitiveness abroad are in danger. Weak sterling can be inflationary, and the government has defended the pound through higher interest rates and central bank intervention. But the pound has continued to fall, dropping below the key psychological barrier of 3 West German marks on Monday. That could mean yet another hike in interest rates. Late Tuesday, the pound was down 3 pfennigs and two cents from Monday, at 2.95 marks and $ 1.5580. The stock market has declined sharply on the prospect of higher interest rates. The Financial Times-100 share index closed at 2,218.8 Tuesday, down 4 percent from last Wednesday, the day before the most recent interest rate hike. The latest troubles began Sept. 26, when the pound was hit by the announcement of a $ 3 billion current account deficit for August, its third worst on record. The trade measure is expected to more than double to $ 24 billion this year.

<HEAD>McCaw Tries Another Tack in LIN Takeover Bid</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RORY MARSHALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> McCaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cellular </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> has boosted its per-share offer for <ORGANIZATION> LIN </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> but said it would be happy with simple control of the cellular-phone company rather than an outright purchase. The announcement Tuesday was the latest twist in a takeover attempt that began in early June. <PERSON> McCaw </PERSON>, based in the <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> suburb of <LOCATION> Kirkland </LOCATION>, said it would pay $ 125 a share in cash for 22 million of <ORGANIZATION> LIN </ORGANIZATION>'s approximately 54 million outstanding shares, or a total of $ 2.75 billion. In June, <ORGANIZATION> McCaw </ORGANIZATION> offered $ 120 a share for the 90 percent of <ORGANIZATION> LIN </ORGANIZATION> stock it does not already own, then lowered its bid in July to $ 110 a share after a court ruling it said lowered the value of New York-based LIN. But analysts predicted that under terms of the new offer, <PERSON> McCaw </PERSON> would still wind up with full ownership of LIN in five years. Combined with nearly 5.1 million LIN shares it already owns, the latest offer would immediately give <PERSON> McCaw </PERSON>, the nation's largest cellular phone operator, slightly more than 50 percent of LIN. And Tuesday's bid said <PERSON> McCaw </PERSON> would guarantee LIN's remaining shares would be exchanged in five years for a price to be determined by the <ORGANIZATION> LIN </ORGANIZATION> board and the company's investment bankers, or that the entire company would be sold at that time at auction. Analysts said that provision almost certainly means <PERSON> McCaw </PERSON> would achieve full ownership of LIN at that time. `` We'll be reviewing it -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> McCaw </ORGANIZATION>'s new offer -RRB- and making a public statement at some future date,'' said <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Plouf </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> LIN </ORGANIZATION>'s vice president of corporate development and treasurer. Beyond that, he said, the company had no comment. The deal values all of <ORGANIZATION> LIN </ORGANIZATION>, which owns seven television stations, cellular telephone properties and a small publishing operation, at about $ 6.75 billion. `` This is almost back to where they were before -LRB- in the June offer -RRB-, ... so from a valuation standpoint it's virtually unchanged _ about $ 290 per ` pop,''' said <PERSON> Geoffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, a telecommunications analyst for <ORGANIZATION> Argus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. A pop is an industry yardstick obtained by multiplying a market-area population by the percentage ownership of cellular systems serving the market `` Really, what they're doing is appeasing institutional investors who do n't want to give up LIN,'' <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said. Trouble financing a full takeover might also have prompted the decision to tone down the offer, said <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Humphries </PERSON>, director of research and a cellular analyst for the <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> investment firm <ORGANIZATION> Hanifen </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Imhoff </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, who noted an offer for the whole company would involve about $ 6 billion in debt. <PERSON> McCaw </PERSON> said in a statement it anticipated no trouble raising the needed capital without a public debt offering, although it said <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, its investment backer, was `` highly confident'' if could raise $ 2.5 billion with an offering if needed. `` We are determined to complete the acquisition of LIN in order to provide a vital link in the creation of a seamless, nationwide cellular network,'' said <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> O. </PERSON> <PERSON> McCaw </PERSON>, the company's chairman and chief executive officer. <PERSON> McCaw </PERSON> has been repeatedly rejected by LIN. The companies said in July they were talking about a merger agreement at $ 127.50 a share, but they could not agree on the timing of the deal and the talks broke off. Last month, LIN announced it intended to merge with the domestic cellular telephone interests of <ORGANIZATION> BellSouth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, the regional telephone company in <LOCATION> Atanta </LOCATION>. Tuesday's move by <PERSON> McCaw </PERSON> left analysts speculating about <ORGANIZATION> BellSouth </ORGANIZATION>'s response. Its offer was valued at about $ 105 per share, only $ 20 of which was cash. `` It's hard to say what a logical reply for them would be,'' <PERSON> Humphries </PERSON> said. `` They could put more cash into the pot and thereby raise the dividend payment. They could try a number of devices, but there's not an easy way.'' Last week, <PERSON> McCaw </PERSON> said it was buying a half-interest in Metro One, a cellular franchise in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> whose other half is owned by LIN. <PERSON> McCaw </PERSON> said it was paying $ 1.9 billion for the interest, which is now owned by <ORGANIZATION> Metromedia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. LIN has a 45-day right to match the <ORGANIZATION> McCaw </ORGANIZATION> offer for the Metro One stake <PERSON> McCaw </PERSON> said Tuesday that after the completion of its tender offer for <ORGANIZATION> LIN </ORGANIZATION>'s shares, it would sell its interest in Metro One to LIN. <PERSON> McCaw </PERSON> also said last week it would sell its interests in 13 mobile-telephone franchises in <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> to <ORGANIZATION> Contel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cellular </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> for $ 1.3 billion _ cash that could be used in the bids for LIN and Metro One.

<HEAD>ALPA Votes To Continue Strike Payments to Eastern Pilots</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Members of the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Line </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pilots </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> gave striking <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> pilots a bracing morale boost by voting to continue special payments to the Eastern strikers. <ORGANIZATION> ALPA </ORGANIZATION>, which represents pilots at nearly all the nation's major carriers, announced late Tuesday that a majority of its members voted to maintain the strike benefits for Eastern pilots. <ORGANIZATION> ALPA </ORGANIZATION> declined to reveal the vote tally, saying only that a simple majority of the returned ballots was needed to continue the payments for six months. The announcement gave a lift to the 2,400 or so <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> pilots in their eighth month of a walkout, after numerous setbacks in their fight against <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s parent <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. Pilot leaders had warned that if <ORGANIZATION> ALPA </ORGANIZATION> abandoned the Eastern pilots, the national union's bargaining position with all the carriers would have been weakened. When the strike against Miami-based <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> began March 4, there were about 3,600 pilots at the airline. Their ranks have thinned since as financial pressures have forced scores back across the picket lines and others have retired or found jobs at other carriers. <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Cole </PERSON>, a spokesman for the striking pilots, said the <ORGANIZATION> ALPA </ORGANIZATION> vote will bolster people still on the picket lines. `` It was n't unexpected, because professional pilots understand that the outcome of the Eastern strike will have a direct bearing on their own futures,'' he said. `` I think it gives them a show of support from their fellow pilots and will help continue their strong resolve.'' The 40,000 or so <ORGANIZATION> ALPA </ORGANIZATION> members were asked to vote last month on whether they wished to keep paying about 3 percent of their salary to their colleagues at <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>, which is trying to emerge from bankruptcy protection as a smaller carrier. <ORGANIZATION> ALPA </ORGANIZATION> declined to say how many pilots voted. The benefits to <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> pilots averaged about $ 2,400 a month per flier since the walkout began. The pilots were a crucial element of support in the strike that started with <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> union, which also was joined by the airline's flight attendants. `` It's a tremendous morale boost,'' <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON> said in a telephone interview from <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>. `` It will certainly give our people a boost to know that <ORGANIZATION> ALPA </ORGANIZATION> supports their strike that strongly.'' Eastern spokeswoman <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> Ceremsak </PERSON> said the airline had no comment on the matter. Later this week the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> could vote on a bill, supported by the <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> unions, to set up a blue-ribbon commission that would investigate the Eastern dispute. In a vote last week, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> decided to cut off debate on the bill. But the White House and the <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> have lobbied heavily against the bill, and President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is likely to veto it. In that case, if <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> could n't muster the votes to override his veto, the pilots could suffer a blow to morale.

That set in motion of series of top-level shifts that will leave <PERSON> Artzt </PERSON> head of the diversified company, which had more than $ 21 billion in worldwide sales last year. <PERSON> Artzt </PERSON>, 59, has been vice chairman of the board and president of <ORGANIZATION> Procter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gamble </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> since 1984. His first major promotion came in 1969, when he was named vice president of the food products division. In another move, company President <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pepper </PERSON> will give up most of his responsibilities for P & amp; G's domestic operations to oversee the international business. During his tenure, <PERSON> Smale </PERSON> helped the company branch out into foreign markets. Roughly 39 percent of its sales in the last fiscal year came from outside the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Smale </PERSON> said the figure should top 50 percent in a few years. `` <ORGANIZATION> Procter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Gamble </ORGANIZATION> is well along the way towards changing from being a <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States-based </LOCATION> business that sells some of its products in international markets to being a truly world company,'' <PERSON> Smale </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Smale </PERSON> also led the company into new product lines and oversaw an $ 805 million reorganization two years ago aimed at streamlining management. Under his leadership, the company acquired <LOCATION> Richardson-Vicks </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Noxell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and some major brands from <PERSON> G.D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Searle </PERSON>. Those moves gave the company a wide base in over-the-counter drugs and beauty products. P & amp; G had sales of $ 21.4 billion in the fiscal year ended June 30, earnings of $ 1.6 billion and dividends of $ 3 per common share _ all company records. <PERSON> Smale </PERSON> cited personal reasons for deciding to give up his executive position Jan. 2. He said he will remain an employee and will serve as a director and as chairman of the board's executive committee. `` By January, I will have been president and then chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Procter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Gamble for nearly 16 years,'' he said. `` I will have been the chief executive officer of the company for nine years. I've reached the conclusion that for me as well as for my family it's time to turn this responsibility over to someone else In other personnel moves, P & amp; G announced that: _ B <PERSON> Jurgen </PERSON> <PERSON> Hintz </PERSON>, a group vice president, was elected an executive vice president. He will be responsible for the company's domestic paper products, cellulose and chemicals, and food and beverage businesses _ <PERSON> Durk </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jager </PERSON>, a group vice president, was chosen an executive vice president He will be responsible for domestic soap, detergent and health and beauty care businesses. _ <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dirvin </PERSON>, senior vice president, becomes an executive vice president He will continue to oversee most of P & amp; G's staff functions, such as sales, advertising, marketing services and public affairs. <PERSON> Smale </PERSON> announced the sweeping changes at a shareholders meeting punctuated by an animal-rights demonstration. Several dozen activists picketed outside the company's headquarters while others questioned <PERSON> Smale </PERSON> during the meeting about P & amp; G's continued use of animals for product-safety testing. <PERSON> Smale </PERSON> repeated the company's position that marketing certain products without animal testing would be unsafe. `` Animal tests are used only when no other acceptable methods are available,'' he said. Animal-rights activists, who have targeted P & amp; G in recent years, have failed to gain approval at recent shareholder meetings for proposals to stop the use of animals in product testing. <PERSON> Smale </PERSON> declined to say how many animals are being used for such purposes. He did say the company reduced the number of animals it uses by one-third in the past five years and will continue to look for alternatives. In other matters, shareholders approved a 2-for-1 stock split effective Oct. 20, and increased the authorized number of common shares from 500 million to 1 billion.

<HEAD>Fed Chairman Says Soviets Pragmatic, Not in Panic</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARK J. PORUBCANSKY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON>, the chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, says Soviet economists appear largely unfettered by ideology as they search for ways out of the country's financial woes. In a meeting Tuesday that would have been unthinkable just a few years ago, <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> held discussions with nine of the top economic minds of a system that has been at the opposite end of the philosophical spectrum for decades. He told a news conference the Soviets are `` willing to reach beyond the usual confines of what economic policy-makers are willing to do.'' `` They are broadening their view to see whether there are applicable views outside their immediate circle,'' <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> said. `` Did we get into an ideological debate over values? No,'' he said. <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> said he was not able to offer specific suggestions to many Soviet economic problems because of his lack of detailed knowledge of its system. But he did discuss such issues as reform and convertibility of the Soviet ruble. The decades of ideological differences resulted in an initial sense of akwardness. `` If I did n't feel odd, I must say, I would be peculiar,'' <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> said. But the Soviets' non-ideological approach dissipated the sense of uncertainty, he said. <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON>, who was chairman of the President's <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advisers </ORGANIZATION> under President <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Ford </PERSON> and also headed a commission on social security reform, met with Finance Minister <PERSON> Valentin </PERSON> <PERSON> Pavlov </PERSON>, Deputy Premier <PERSON> Leonid </PERSON> <PERSON> Abalkin </PERSON>, and other top officials and economic theorists. Those officials are trying to right an economy struggling with a huge budget deficit, bare store shelves, increasing consumer fears of even worse conditions, strikes, and a near-worthless currency. Despite their troubles, <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> said there is no sense of crisis among the Soviet economists. In their meetings, <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> said the Soviets sought information on the Western approach to solving individual economic problems. But they will not try to superimpose capitalism on their own system, he said. The nited <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> can help by providing economic expertise on particular issues, but discussion of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economic aid, as some Soviet officials have suggested, was not on the agenda, he said. `` What they have basically is an understanding that they have to restructure and that the issue of success is theirs,'' <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> also turned his attention to exchange rates in the world market in a speech for delivery later to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet officials at the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassador's residence in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. In an advanced text released in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> said that `` attempts to maintain unrealistic exchange rates may lead to destabilizing international capital flows, and ultimately have to be abandoned.'' He said that paying inordinate attention to intermediate targets in setting monetary policy `` may not promote the attainment of long-term goals.'' <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> made his remarks as the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> finds itself under pressure from the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration to take action to bring the dollar down from its steep rise against foreign currencies this year. The fed also is being urged by some administration officials to ease its grip on credit to steer the economy clear of recession.

<HEAD>Nine Companies Form CFC Clearinghouse</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Nine major companies say they are forming a clearinghouse to promote cooperation among themselves and others in ending use of chlorofluorocarbons, or CFCs, as cleaning agents. Some of the companies who made the announcement Tuesday had made clear previously their intention of seeking substitutes for CFCs. CFCs are used widely as refrigeration fluids in air conditioners and refrigerators as well in as cleaning solvents for metals and electronic components. They escape into the atmosphere where they damage the high-altitude ozone shield that protects the earth from the sun's ultraviolet radiation,. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and 44 other countries have agreed to phase out the production of CFCs with hopes of eliminating them altogether by the turn of the century. The companies participating in the announcement Tuesday were <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T, <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Digital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Equipment </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Honeywell </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Motorola </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Northern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telecom </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Instruments </ORGANIZATION>. The organization, called the <ORGANIZATION> Industry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cooperative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ozone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Layer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION>, will act as a clearinghouse for information on new substitute solvents, encourage the prompt adoption of safe substitutes, and work with producers and the government to distribute information about substitutes to developing countries.

<HEAD>Government Puts FADA Up For Sale</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Federal regulators say they will try to sell the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Asset </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disposition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, a quasi-private company created to manage and sell sour loans and real estate from failed savings institutions. <ORGANIZATION> FADA </ORGANIZATION> in structure is a private financial institution, but it is wholly owned by the federal government. Until early last year, it was under intense congressional scrutiny after critics complained that <ORGANIZATION> FADA </ORGANIZATION> had grown into a bloated, inefficient bureaucracy mired in political favortism and insider dealing. The <ORGANIZATION> Resolution </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, a 2-month-old government agency created to handle failed S & amp; Ls, said Tuesday it will accept bids until Oct. 31 for a sale to settle no later than Nov. 30. If no bids are acceptable, <ORGANIZATION> FADA </ORGANIZATION> will be taken over by the government and its 275 employees offered government jobs working for the <ORGANIZATION> RTC </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> FADA </ORGANIZATION> manages about $ 3 billion in real estate and loans from failed thrifts, having disposed of $ 1.3 billion in the four years since it was created. <ORGANIZATION> FADA </ORGANIZATION>'s purchaser will acquire offices in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>, a computer system, office furnishings and not much else. The sale will not include the agency's name, stock, charter as a financial institution, cash or the right to retain government management contracts. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Wills </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> FADA </ORGANIZATION>, said his organization offers buyers a core of real estate experts ready to participate in a flood of work as the government attempts to resolve the S & amp; L mess, including the sale of an estimated $ 100 billion in hard-to-sell real estate and bad loans. `` If you intend to get into the asset management business, it's one way to way get the largest group of professionals that have expertise in managing these troubled assets coming out of the thrift industry,'' he said <PERSON> Wills </PERSON> acknowledged past criticism, but said: `` Every single rock in <ORGANIZATION> FADA </ORGANIZATION> was turned over and examined. If anything, because of the intense scrutiny, we came out of it much more sound than any comparable organization.'' <PERSON> Wills </PERSON> said about 40 companies have expressed varying degrees of interest in <ORGANIZATION> FADA </ORGANIZATION>. But industry officials believe the core of serious buyers is much smaller. The successful bidder would have three alternatives: seek management contracts from the <ORGANIZATION> RTC </ORGANIZATION>, compete to buy property outright from the <ORGANIZATION> RTC </ORGANIZATION> or offer its management services to financial institutions and others that end up owning the S & amp; L property, <PERSON> Wills </PERSON> said. J.E. <ORGANIZATION> Robert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cos. </ORGANIZATION>, an <LOCATION> Alexandria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, company specializing in the management of distressed real estate, is among the organizations considering making an offer for <ORGANIZATION> FADA </ORGANIZATION>, according to company chairman <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> `` You might look at it as paying a headhunter fee to acquire the services of 275 employees,'' he said. `` -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> FADA </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- will be of interest to people already heavily engaged in this business who have a confident feeling they'll be successful in expanding. Otherwise, <ORGANIZATION> FADA </ORGANIZATION> becomes a very expensive enterprise.'' Among other possible bidders, according to industry sources, are <ORGANIZATION> NCNB </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION>, a Dallas-based company that has already purchased the deposits of several failed thrifts.

<HEAD>US Complains About European Limits on Imported TV Programs</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAY ARNOLD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will file a fair-trade complaint against the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> over a non-binding quota system designed to limit imported TV programs to no more than half of all shows aired, says <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Trade Representative <PERSON> Carla </PERSON> <PERSON> Hills </PERSON>. <PERSON> Hills </PERSON>, who previously said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would fight any local content rules the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> implements for television as part of its plan to remove trade barriers between its member nations by 1992, said Tuesday she was `` deeply disturbed'' by the Oct. 3 decision on TV. Although the Television Without Frontiers directive was not binding on member nations, <PERSON> Hills </PERSON> said it was `` blatantly protectionist and unjustifiable, and discriminates against <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and other non-EC film goods.'' In <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Mo </LOCATION>., and other members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> held what <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> called a `` spirited exchange'' with <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> officials about the new TV measure `` We feel very strongly about this issue,'' said <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>. `` It's especially troubling for Americans to see a product that we do have some skill in ... and some advantage to be closed down to any extent.'' <PERSON> Hills </PERSON> said she `` will take immediate action to address that decision'' under the 96-nation free-trade accord known as the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. `` The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> government believes that the local content requirement in the broadcast directive is inconsistent with the community's obligation not to discriminate against foreign products _ to give equal treatment _ under the <ORGANIZATION> GATT </ORGANIZATION>. I am initiating prompt action in that forum,'' <PERSON> Hills </PERSON> said in a prepared statement. <ORGANIZATION> GATT </ORGANIZATION> has no police power over its member nations, but <PERSON> Hills </PERSON>' action indicates the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration is having second thoughts about the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION>'s 1992 program <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Mosbacher </PERSON> last week told a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> foreign affairs subcommittee that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> may have to reassess its position if the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> continues towards local content rules in areas such as television, computer chips, telecommunications equipment and automobiles. According to industry figures, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> realizes a $ 3 billion annual surplus balance of trade through film and TV exports, and <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> is the leading market for such programs with about $ 700 million in purchases yearly. TV series such as `` Miami Vice'' and `` <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>'' are enormously popular in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, which has caused legislators there to decry the `` Americanization'' of their populaces. Officials estimate that out of 125,000 hours of TV shown in <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> annually, only 20,000 hours are produced in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> provide the remainder. <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> had urged mandatory quotas be placed on TV programming, but the <ORGANIZATION> EC </ORGANIZATION> declined to do so. <PERSON> Hills </PERSON> said the cultural argument was a smokescreen for economic protectionism. `` We do not understand why the <LOCATION> Spanish </LOCATION> culture is more protected by a film produced in <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> by ` Europeans' than by a Spanish film of Mexican origin, or why the English culture is promoted more by a film produced in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> by ` Europeans' than by a film of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION> origin. ... The definition of ` European works' is economic, not cultural,'' she said. She added that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> concerns were further heightened by press reports that the <ORGANIZATION> EC </ORGANIZATION> is pledging hundreds of millions of additional dollars in subsidies to European producers and writers.

 If he succeeds with his bold $ 7 billion buyout bid for <ORGANIZATION> AMR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, developer <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> pledges to keep the parent of <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> at its headquarters in <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. `` I have absolutely no intention of moving <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> from the <LOCATION> Dallas-Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION> area,'' <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> said Tuesday in a telephone interview from his <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> office. <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>, who said he knows and likes the <LOCATION> Dallas-Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION> area, appeared to make the statement to reassure <ORGANIZATION> AMR </ORGANIZATION> employees. The head of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION>'s second-largest union, the 16,000-member <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Professional </ORGANIZATION> Flight Attendants, recently met with advisers to discuss possible ways to help management fend off <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>'s bid. AMR has had little to say about <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>'s offer beyond its initial response that the bid would be considered `` in due course,'' although the company said it preferred to remain independent. <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>'s $ 120-a-share cash offer for the nation's largest and most profitable airline has been met with suspicion by many in the financial community, who see it as a ploy to drive up the price of <ORGANIZATION> AMR </ORGANIZATION> stock and enhance <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>'s own holdings. AMR tumbled $ 3.375 a share to $ 101.375 Tuesday in active trading on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, apparently reflecting investor skepticism about <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>'s offer. A major institutional investor said Tuesday it had joined the list of Trump doubters. Since Thursday, when <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>'s offer was made public, <ORGANIZATION> Windsor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION> sold its 425,000 shares to take advantage of the increase stock price, said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Neff </PERSON>, who has managed the fund for 25 years. `` I have a hard time taking Mr. <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> seriously. $ 120's a very full price, and I do n't know where the financing is going to come from,'' <PERSON> Neff </PERSON> said. `` This is n't loose change.'' But the real estate tycoon insists his intentions are real. `` I'm very serious about it,'' he said. `` I think this is a company with great potential and I look forward to getting it.'' <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> declined to provide details of his financing plan, although he said it involves `` relatively little leverage'' and no foreign investors _ two major areas of concern raised by the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> regarding the current wave of airline buyouts. <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> AMR </ORGANIZATION> last week that he would put up $ 1 billion of equity in the deal and believes financing is readily available for the remainder. The developer has a reputation as a good customer who has paid off debts and has warm relations with bankers. His blue-chip real estate and casino properties could be readily borrowed against, while <ORGANIZATION> AMR </ORGANIZATION>'s assets also could be considered as collateral, observers say.

<HEAD>Dollar Closes Higher, Stocks Plunge in Tokyo</HEAD>

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The dollar closed higher against the yen today despite the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION>'s discount rate increase and massive dollar selling, and the <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>'s key index plunged. The dollar closed at 143.90 yen, up 1.67 yen from Monday's close of 142.23 yen. It opened at 144.90 yen and moved between 142.55 yen and 144.95 yen. Currency and stock markets were closed Tuesday for a Japanese holiday. The dollar's high opening followed overseas rallies overnight, but it edged down in early trading amid rumors of an increase in the discount rate, the charge for funds borrowed by banks from the central bank. After the morning session, the bank raised the rate by 0.5 percentage point to 3.75 percent. Higher interest rates tend to make a country's currency more attractive to investors, pushing up its value. `` The decision came in consideration of recent currency market fluctuations, movements in foreign interest rates, domestic economic trends, consumer prices and the money supply,'' Bank of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Satoshi </PERSON> <PERSON> Sumita </PERSON> told a news conference. The dollar had climbed to a closing of 145 yen on Sept. 22 before monetary officials of seven major industrialized nations decided on efforts to check its rise. It dropped to 139.30 yen on Oct. 2, but has been moving generally upward since. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> hopes the rate hike will contribute to sustainable growth led by domestic demand while maintaining consumer price stability,'' <PERSON> Sumita </PERSON> said, adding that the move was intended to stem inflation. Although <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> also had raised its official discount rate last week, <PERSON> Sumita </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s decision was reached independently. <PERSON> Toru </PERSON> <PERSON> Kanai </PERSON>, foreign currency analyst with <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>, said, the discount rate increase `` came out of the blue, and many of us had expected the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> discount rate cut to come first. <ORGANIZATION> Daiwa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> dealer <PERSON> Kazuyuki </PERSON> <PERSON> Suzuki </PERSON> added: `` I never dreamed that the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> would take such a step prior to reports of important economic indicators such as the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> wholesale price index, due out Friday.'' <PERSON> Yoshitsugu </PERSON> <PERSON> Hanada </PERSON>, a senior trader with <ORGANIZATION> Mitsui </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>, said the central bank also sold large amounts of dollars in the afternoon in an attempt to push the dollar down, but the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> currency still showed strength. `` Speculative investors were still inclined to buy the dollar because that's one of their few decent choices of investment, considering the uptrend in domestic interest rates, narrowing the gap with those overseas,'' <PERSON> Hanada </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> Nikkei </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> lost 136.28 points, or 0.39 percent, closing at 35,240.07. It had gained 167 points Monday. The index plunged about 360 points after the discount rate increase was announced, but recovered as some investors took advantage of lower prices to buy various issues, <PERSON> Suzuki </PERSON> said. `` But the latest discount rate hike will certainly damage the stock market, which no longer will grow as fast as it used to,'' he added. Stock trading was moderate, with first section volume estimated at 750 million shares, up from Monday's 700 million. It was the second discount rate increase this year. On May 30, it was raised 0.75 percentage points, to 3.25 percent.

 The dollar rose in early European trading today, despite a half-point increase in the Japanese discount rate and massive dollar-selling in earlier Asian trading. Gold prices fell. `` Half a point was too little. The market had expected a full point, so we will probably go a bit firmer,'' said one dealer at a private bank in <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> were both reported to have sold dollars in East Asian markets. In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, where trading ends before <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s business day begins, the dollar closed at 143.90 yen, up 1.67 yen from Monday. The <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> market was closed Tuesday for a national holiday. Later, in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, it was quoted at 144.50 yen.

<HEAD>Telerate Panel Rejects Dow Jones Offer for Remaining 33 Percent</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Dow Jones & amp; Co.. <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> says it intends to proceed with its $ 576 million tender offer for the 33 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Telerate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> that it does not already own even though <ORGANIZATION> Telerate </ORGANIZATION>'s directors found the offer inadeqaute `` We are proceeding with our $ 18 per share offer and continue to believe that the offer is fair to all Telerate stockholders,'' <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jones </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON> said Tuesday. Wall Streeters evidently expect that Dow Jones will have to sweeten its bid, however. Telerate rose 12 -LCB- cents a share to close at $ 20.37 -LCB- on Tuesday on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. Telerate, a provider of computerized financial information, said a special panel of its directors urged shareholders not to tender their stock under terms of the <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jones </ORGANIZATION> offer and urged <PERSON> Dow </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> to arrange a meeting `` in order to achieve a mutually agreed upon transaction.'' <PERSON> Dow </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, publisher of the <ORGANIZATION> Wall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Street </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION>, said it was disappointed by the panel's assessment of its offer but indicated it has no plans to raise it or negotiate with the committee. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON>, <PERSON> Dow </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>' vice president, corporate counsel and secretary, said <PERSON> Dow </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> `` has no plans to meet with the Telerate special committee'' and no plans to raise its bid. Dow Jones, which also publishes Barron's magazine, community newspapers and electronic business information, became involved with <ORGANIZATION> Telerate </ORGANIZATION> in 1985 when it purchased a 32 percent stake in the company. It subsequently increased its stake to 67 percent. On Sept. 21, <PERSON> Dow </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> said it planned to offer $ 18 a share for the remaining <ORGANIZATION> Telerate </ORGANIZATION> shares, and began the tender offer five days later. The offer and withdrawal rights are scheduled to expire Nov. 3. <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> said <PERSON> Dow </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>' investment bankers have since met with those of the Telerate special committee to describe how it came to the pricing of its offer, although not to negotiate any terms. In its announcement Tuesday, <ORGANIZATION> Telerate </ORGANIZATION> said that the special panel, with concurrence of other <ORGANIZATION> Telerate </ORGANIZATION> directors who are not employed by or consultants to <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jones </ORGANIZATION>, found the $ 18 a share offer `` inadequate and not in the best interests of its stockholders.'' <ORGANIZATION> Telerate </ORGANIZATION>'s founder and chief executive, <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hirsch </PERSON>, said he will not tender any of his shares, which represent about 6 percent of the company's stock, and that no other director or executive of <ORGANIZATION> Telerate </ORGANIZATION> would tender under the current offer. <PERSON> Hirsch </PERSON> said the special committee had `` received clear indications'' from stockholders owning another 5 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Telerate </ORGANIZATION>'s stock of their `` genuine dissatisfaction with the price <PERSON> Dow </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> is offering.'' On Monday, <ORGANIZATION> Telerate </ORGANIZATION> reported its third-quarter earnings dropped 17.4 percent compared with a year earlier and said it is in negotiations to buy the 50 percent stake that its partner <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telegraph </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> owns in the joint venture <ORGANIZATION> Global </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transactions </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>.

 Contract talks in the eight-day walkout by <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. Machinists could resume within a week, a key union leader says There have been no talks since some 57,800 Machinists left their jobs on Oct. 4. Federal mediator <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> <PERSON> Hammond </PERSON> has been in daily contact with both sides and will call for talks `` when he gets a signal ... a feeling that there's a reason to call the parties together,'' said <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lodge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> 751 </ORGANIZATION>. `` I think that within a week, we'll see that process starting,'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said Tuesday. The last <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> strike was a 45-day walkout by the Machinists in 1977, and `` two months is not really long'' for the aerospace industry, <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday delivered the third jetliner it has completed since the walkout began. It was a 747-400 received by <ORGANIZATION> Qantas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>. The company said another three dozen or so might be completed by supervisors and Machinists crossing picket lines. Meanwhile, <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION>'s second-largest union, the 27,000-person <ORGANIZATION> Seattle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Professional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineering </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Employees </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, voted to seek a 14 percent wage increase when its talks begin Monday. So far, the Machinists' walkout has not strained relations with airlines and jet leasing companies, despite worldwide pressure to replace aging aircraft with quieter, more technologically advanced and fuel-efficient models, <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Carr </PERSON> said Tuesday. `` They understand it's just one of those facts of doing business,'' he said. He said about three dozen aircraft were on the `` flight lines,'' with almost all basic assembly completed. Each still requires exhaustive calibration of instruments, testing and `` maybe a little touch-up work'' normally done by the strikers, <PERSON> Carr </PERSON> said. `` They go all the way from within days to two months or so'' away from delivery, he said. After five consecutive years of record orders, <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> has a backlog stretching into the late 1990s. In completing aircraft for delivery, `` the initial concentration is on the flight lines,'' <PERSON> Carr </PERSON> said. Another 28 or 29 planes are in various stages of assembly on the 737 and 757 lines in <LOCATION> Renton </LOCATION> and the 747 and 767 lines in <LOCATION> Everett </LOCATION>, but they probably can not be completed without major defections from union ranks, <PERSON> Carr </PERSON> said. `` It's unrealistic to think you can replace 43,000 skilled people,'' he said. <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION>'s offer, spurned by Machinists in an 85 percent strike vote Oct. 3, featured an immediate wage hike of 4 percent with 3 percent raises in both 1990 and 1991, bonuses of 8 percent of worker's gross earnings this year and 3 percent in 1990, a cost-of-living clause to virtually match inflation, a reduction in mandatory overtime and increases in some benefits. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>'s local represents about 43,300 <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> workers in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> and its suburbs. Another 12,000 or so work in <LOCATION> Wichita </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kan. </LOCATION>, 1,700 in <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ore. </LOCATION>, and a few hundred others at sites in several other states. <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> earned $ 356 million on sales of $ 9.07 billion for the first half of 1989 and reported $ 614 million in profits on $ 16.96 billion in sales in 1988. In a meeting Monday night, members of the engineers and technical workers group adopted as bargaining goals wage increases of 14 percent in the first year, 9 percent in the second year, 8 percent in the first half of the third year and 4 percent in the second half of the final year, plus quarterly cost-of-living adjustments and an unspecified lump-sum bonus. Engineers and technical workers, bound by a no-strike clause in a contract expiring Dec. 1, have been crossing the Machinists' picket lines while refusing to do work normally done by the strikers The current three-year contract boosted wages by 3 percent, 2 percent and 2 percent for engineers and 2 percent, 2 percent and 3 percent for technical workers. Engineers also got a one-time 9 percent bonus and technical employees bonuses of 5 percent the first year and nearly 3 percent in each of the next two years.

 Life for <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> executive <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> <PERSON> Bidwell </PERSON> would have been a lot easier if <ORGANIZATION> Soichiro </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Honda </ORGANIZATION> had n't done what he had done. <PERSON> Bidwell </PERSON>, speaking Tuesday night at the annual Automotive Hall of Fame dinner, said competition among automakers in the 1990s will be tougher than ever and part of that is because of <ORGANIZATION> Honda </ORGANIZATION>. The 82-year-old founder of <ORGANIZATION> Honda </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION> was among four people inducted into the Automotive Hall of Fame He is the first Japanese national honored by the group that began in 1939 as the Automobile Old Timers. <ORGANIZATION> Honda </ORGANIZATION> was a man `` without whom my life would have been a lot easier,'' said <PERSON> Bidwell </PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION>'s manufacturing arm, <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. There has been speculation that if <ORGANIZATION> Honda </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> sales keep growing and if <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION>'s keep falling, the Japanese company could become the third-largest selling auto company in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Earlier in the day, <ORGANIZATION> Honda </ORGANIZATION> brushed aside such speculation, saying, `` If we make progress, so will <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION>. So I do n't think the difference between the two companies will become that much smaller.'' But competition is high on the mind of <PERSON> Bidwell </PERSON> and other auto executives. `` There is conventional, nuclear, and thermonuclear warfare,'' he said. `` We are at stage three. `` I said for five years it is a jungle out there. It is n't anymore It's worse.'' He said that for a time <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> had pretty much locked up the market on three segments _ minivans, four-door sport-utility vehicles and convertibles. `` Now they -LRB- the market segments -RRB- look like Grand Central Station,'' <PERSON> Bidwell </PERSON> said. `` There is a fight to the finish and in a fight to the finish ... the low-cost producer wins, the high-cost producer loses.'' <PERSON> Bidwell </PERSON> made only a passing remark about the company's effort to slash $ 1 billion out of its $ 26 billion budget by the end of next year. Included in that are the elimination of about 8 percent of the salaried work force, or about 2,300 jobs. `` We will take suggestions -LRB- about cost cutting -RRB- about anything from anywhere,'' he said. <ORGANIZATION> Honda </ORGANIZATION>'s motorcycle company began making cars in 1963. It became the first Japanese company to set up a manufacturing plant in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and later this year will open its second. Both, along with an engine factory and a research facility, are located in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>. `` Our company in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> has been so well accepted ...'' he said, `` that I truly believe it is an American company.'' Inducted with <ORGANIZATION> Honda </ORGANIZATION> were: _ <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> Buehrig </PERSON>, the chief engineer of the <LOCATION> Dusenberg </LOCATION>, Cord and <ORGANIZATION> Auburn </ORGANIZATION> Speedster automobiles _ <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Kent </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Cadillac </ORGANIZATION> dealer in <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> _ <PERSON> Elmer </PERSON> <PERSON> Wavering </PERSON>, who installed the first radio in a car and went on to develop the first commercially successful car radio in 1930 He later became associated with <ORGANIZATION> Motorola </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>Antonini Says New Stores, Ad Appearances Will Help 4th Quarter</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A persistent economy, precision marketing and even some personal television appearances could help <ORGANIZATION> K </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> mart </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> out of its 1989 sales doldrums, company Chairman <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonini </PERSON> says. <PERSON> Antonini </PERSON> also outlined a $ 1.3-billion expansion plan Tuesday that would increase the number of K mart discount stores to 2,500 by 1995, from the current 2,283. The chairman told a news conference he is trying his new advertising approach in commercials being tested in the Pueblo and <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION> areas of <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>. `` I can go on TV in front of the American public and tell them what we are doing,'' he said, adding that he will appear nationally in commercials on two K mart-produced Christmas specials. One is `` Christmas in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' a movie starring <PERSON> Kenny </PERSON> <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON>. The other is a program on Christmas entertaining with author <PERSON> Martha </PERSON> <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON>, who also lends her name to a line of K mart household products. <PERSON> Antonini </PERSON> said lower-than-expected inflation and interest rates and better-than-expected employment are raising his hopes for strong holiday sales that could rescue an otherwise slow year. `` We're more optimistic than we were four months ago,'' he said. The fourth quarter is the last hope for a strong year; K mart said last week that third-quarter profits will be down from last year. The fourth quarter also could get a boost as K mart opens 43 new stores and finishes the expansion of 63 others this fall, <PERSON> Antonini </PERSON> said. Beyond that time, profit margins will improve as the company connects 2,200 of its stores to its centralized inventory computer system by the end of next year for greater marketing precision, <PERSON> Antonini </PERSON> said. `` We know what product sells in <LOCATION> Hoboken </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, we know the price it sells for, and we know how many sold on Monday,'' he said. `` We never knew that before.'' Television advertising will be stepped up, he said. After buying about 24 weeks of national television advertising for this year, the company will increase that to about 30 weeks next year and key some ads to products featured in its newspaper circulars. K mart predicted sagging third-quarter earnings last week when it reported September sales of $ 2.6 billion. That was up 6.1 percent from September 1988, but up only 3 percent when comparing stores open for the full year. The company reported earnings of $ 145 million, down 10.9 percent, for its second fiscal quarter, which ended July 26. Second-quarter sales of $ 7 billion were up 4.8 percent. For the fiscal year, beginning Feb. 1, sales reached $ 17.7 billion through Sept. 27, up only 4.7 percent overall and a sluggish 1.2 percent on a comparable store basis. K mart reported fiscal 1988 earnings of $ 803 million on sales of $ 27.3 billion.

 The stock market declined broadly today, continuing the pullback that began in Tuesday's session. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dropped 6.85 to 2,778.48 in th e first half hour of trading. Losers outnumbered gainers by 2 to 1 in nationwide trading of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> Exchange-listed issues, with 340 up, 680 down and 483 unchanged. Volume on the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> came to 22.6 million shares as of 10 a.m. on Wall Street. Analysts said traders increasingly yielded to the temptation to cash in their gains after the market's rise to record highs last week and Monday. The tendency to lighten up was apparently heightened by a dimming of hopes for any moves soon by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> to relax its credit policy. Interest rates, which had been dropping in recent days on hopes of some stimulus from the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>, were mixed in today's credit-market activity.

 The owner of the <ORGANIZATION> Denver </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nuggets </ORGANIZATION> says he has called off the $ 65 million sale of the basketball franchise to two businessmen who stood to become the first black owners of a major <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> professional sports team. <PERSON> Sidney </PERSON> <PERSON> Shlenker </PERSON> said in a statement Tuesday that he was allowing the contract for the sale of the <ORGANIZATION> NBA </ORGANIZATION> team to <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Bynoe </PERSON>, 38, and <PERSON> Bertram </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>, 50, both of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, to expire. The two had planned to buy the club in a deal announced in July. <PERSON> Bynoe </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> had missed at least two deadlines for completing the deal since it was announced, and there had been several signs in recent weeks that the deal was shaky. However, <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>, reached at home in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> today, said, `` No, that's not true,'' when asked about the deal falling through. He referred further questions to a public relations firm, which did not immediately return calls. <PERSON> Bynoe </PERSON> also did not return calls. <PERSON> Shlenker </PERSON> had earlier set a deadline of 5 p.m. Tuesday for <PERSON> Bynoe </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> to complete the deal, but team officials said work was continuing after the deadline. About four hours later, the team said <PERSON> Shlenker </PERSON> had backed out. <PERSON> Bynoe </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> apparently had the financing in place but the documentation was incomplete, said <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Checketts </PERSON>, who was to take over as president under the new ownership. `` It's just a matter of going through all the documents,'' <PERSON> Bynoe </PERSON> said on Monday. `` I am optimistic we will be able to do what needs to be done, but I ca n't speak for <PERSON> Sidney </PERSON>.''

<HEAD>United Telecom Announces Consolidation With US Sprint Unit</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telecommunications </ORGANIZATION> said today it will consolidate operations with its <ORGANIZATION> US </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sprint </ORGANIZATION> long-distance company to make the corporation more efficient as <ORGANIZATION> Sprint </ORGANIZATION> continues rapid growth. `` These organizational changes will allow <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telecom </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> US </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sprint </ORGANIZATION> to operate largely as a single company,'' said <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Esrey </PERSON>, president and chief executive officer of both <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telecom </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Sprint </ORGANIZATION>. It also will make the company better at setting strategy and increase profits by cutting down on duplications, he said. <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telecom </ORGANIZATION> now owns 80.1 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Sprint </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's third-largest long-distance company <ORGANIZATION> GTE </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Stamford </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, owns 19.9 percent. Sprint was started in July 1986 as a joint venture between <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telecom </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> GTE </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telecom </ORGANIZATION> bought controlling interest in January, and spokesman <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Forsythe </PERSON> said the company has an agreement to buy <ORGANIZATION> GTE </ORGANIZATION>'s remaining shares at some point in the future. Sprint, which lost more than $ 1 billion for its parent companies from mid-1986 to the end of 1988, began showing its first-ever quarterly profits in March thanks to strong sales growth on its fiber-optic long-distance system. On Tuesday, <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telecom </ORGANIZATION> reported its profits jumped 75 percent in the third quarter because of <ORGANIZATION> Sprint </ORGANIZATION>'s second straight quarter of billion-dollar sales. The company projected further growth as <ORGANIZATION> Sprint </ORGANIZATION> begins work on a contract to provide 40 percent of a new communications system for the federal government. Under the realignment of the two companies, <PERSON> Esrey </PERSON>, 49, will remain in his <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telecom </ORGANIZATION> post but switch to chairman and CEO of Sprint. <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> LeMay </PERSON>, 43, will become president and chief operating officer of <ORGANIZATION> Sprint </ORGANIZATION> and president of <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telecom </ORGANIZATION>'s long-distance division. <PERSON> LeMay </PERSON> previously served as executive vice president of corporate affairs for <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telecom </ORGANIZATION>. The companies' legal, financial and data systems operations will be consolidated, and the company will form a <ORGANIZATION> US </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sprint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Reston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va </LOCATION>. Both companies have their headquarters in the <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> area. In addition to <ORGANIZATION> Sprint </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telecom </ORGANIZATION> also owns local telephone companies in the South and <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION>.

 Grain and soybean futures prices were mostly higher this morning on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>, bouncing back from recent steep losses on buying inspired by technical factors and new export business. Soybean futures displayed the greatest strength in early trading after falling to 23-month lows Tuesday under heavy harvest-related selling. `` The markets have really gotten battered around lately and were oversold,'' said <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> <PERSON> Karlin </PERSON>, an analyst at <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. Some of the recent losses were linked to expectations that the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> will increase its 1989 corn and soybean harvest estimates in a crop report due out after the close of trading on Thursday. But <PERSON> Conrad </PERSON> <PERSON> Leslie </PERSON>, an influential private crop analyst based in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, released pre-report estimates late Tuesday that fell below general market expectations, prompting some buying this morningg. Additional support today stemmed from <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> confirmation late Tuesday that the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> purchased 150,000 metric tons of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> soybean meal. In early trading, wheat futures were \ cent lower to 1 \ cents higher with the contract for delivery in December at $ 4.06 -RCB- a bushel; corn futures were -LCB- cent to 1 -LCB- cents higher with December at $ 2.34 -RCB- a bushel; oats were 1 cent to 2 cents higher with December at $ 1.41 -LCB- a bushel; soybeans were 4 cents to 6 cents higher with November at $ 5.56 \ a Livestock futures were narrowly mixed while pork bellies were higher in early trading on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. Live cattle were .08 cent lower to .05 cent higher with October at 72.80 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .05 cent lower to .13 cent higher with October at 82.95 cents a pound; live hogs were .10 cent lower to .28 cent higher with October at 47.55 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were .35 cent to .95 cent higher with February at 46.97 cents a pound. Cattle futures advanced on Tuesday while pork futures were mixed.

 A helicopter apparently lost its main rotor and crashed onto a highway median, killing all five people aboard, including three executives of <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>'s casino empire. `` There was a loud bang, like a piston rod going,'' said <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Murray </PERSON>, 38, of <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Providence </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> R.I. </LOCATION>, who was camping near the site of Tuesday afternoon's crash, a wooded thicket between lanes of the Garden State Parkway. `` It fell below the tree-line and I did n't see it crash,'' he said. `` It went straight down. ... It seemed like an eternity watching it.'' No one on the ground was hurt. A Trump executive today disputed a report in the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> that the billionarie developer had been scheduled to take the one-hour flight to <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> but canceled at the last moment because he got too busy. `` Trump had definitely never planned to be on it,'' said <PERSON> Bernie </PERSON> <PERSON> Dillon </PERSON>, the vice president of <ORGANIZATION> Trump </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sports </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Entertainment </ORGANIZATION>. State Police Sgt. <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Aceto </PERSON> said the main rotor was found a quarter-mile from the crash site about 30 miles north of <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, where the helicopter was returning the executives from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> investigators were looking into a rotor malfunction, said <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Ghiorsi </PERSON>, the agency's regional director `` If the main rotor separated from the rest of the aircraft, it was out of control,'' <PERSON> Ghiorsi </PERSON> said. He said investigators were looking for the tail rotor to help them re-create the problem. Investigators said the loss of one of the two rotors could have caused the other to fall off. <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Klores </PERSON> identified the executives as <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Hyde </PERSON>, 43, chief executive officer of <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> casino operations; <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Etess </PERSON>, 38, president of the Taj Mahal casino project; and, <PERSON> Jonathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Benanav </PERSON>, 33, senior vice president of Trump Plaza casino hotel. `` They were three fabulous young men in the prime of their lives,'' billionaire developer <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> said in a statement from his <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> office. `` No better human beings ever existed. We're deeply saddened by this devastating tragedy. Our hearts go out to their families.'' The others killed were pilot <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Kent </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Ronkonkoma </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, and co-pilot <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Diener </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Westbury </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> said. The helicopter, a 1982 Agusta 109A, was leased from <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Lincoln </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>, and had taken off from <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> for <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, officials said. Officials at <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> said they could not answer questions about the crash. Traffic was delayed because of the crash, but the road remained open. <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Librizzi </PERSON>, manager of a parkway maintenance crew, said he was one of the first to reach the wreckage. `` I walked in and turned right around,'' he said. `` I walked in there and all I saw was one body thrown out of the helicopter. ... I saw another slumped over.'' Investigators were trying to determine if the pilot was in radio contact with air traffic controllers before the crash, said <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Yurman </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION> air safety director. Helicopters are not equipped with flight data and cockpit voice recorders _ the `` black boxes'' aboard commercial airliners. The Trump executives had been in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> for a news conference promoting the Feb. 3 <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boxing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> bout at the Trump Plaza Hotel and Casino between junior welterweights <PERSON> Hector </PERSON> <PERSON> Camacho </PERSON> and <PERSON> Vinny </PERSON> <PERSON> Pazienza </PERSON>.

 <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> `` Today'' show co-anchor <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Pauley </PERSON> says she probably will leave the program by the end of the year but will stay with the network `` in some fashion or other,'' <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> reported today. Neither she nor the network would comment on the report. <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Peggy </PERSON> <PERSON> Hubble </PERSON> said a statement on <PERSON> Pauley </PERSON>'s future probably would be made later in the day Ms. <PERSON> Pauley </PERSON>, who has two years left on her <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> contract, did n't return calls and was reported by her office out taping an interview. `` I am definitely staying at <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> quoted Ms. <PERSON> Pauley </PERSON> as saying in a telephone interview from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Ms. <PERSON> Pauley </PERSON> has been co-anchor of `` Today'' for 13 years, but her future with the program has been the subject of speculation in the weeks since <PERSON> Deborah </PERSON> <PERSON> Norville </PERSON> took over as newscaster on the program. `` Thirteen years ago today <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Pauley </PERSON> began on ` Today,''' co-anchor <PERSON> Bryant </PERSON> <PERSON> Gumbel </PERSON> said at the opening of this morning's broadcast `` That's a long time. Is that a lifetime?'' `` It's a long time. It's my whole adult life, virtually,'' Ms. <PERSON> Pauley </PERSON> responded. `` Thank you.'' At the end of the broadcast, the words `` Happy Anniversary'' flashed on the screen. Ms. <PERSON> Pauley </PERSON> told the newspaper there has been no hostility among members of the `` Today'' cast, although she did say the place has been more tense since Ms. <PERSON> Norville </PERSON> swapped duties with <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Palmer </PERSON>, who has been sent to `` NBC News at Sunrise.'' `` When it was first revealed to me that <PERSON> John </PERSON> and <PERSON> Deborah </PERSON> were going to switch, that was a real blow,'' Ms. <PERSON> Pauley </PERSON> was quoted as saying. `` I like him very much, and I thought, ` Why <PERSON> John </PERSON>? What did he do to anybody?' But as soon as you say anything, it sounds like a jealous older woman talking about a younger one.'' Ms. <PERSON> Norville </PERSON> is 31; Ms. <PERSON> Pauley </PERSON> will be 39 at the end of this month. Ms. <PERSON> Pauley </PERSON> told her interviewer that if she does leave `` Today,'' she would `` still like to come back to the show now and then in the future, the way <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Walters </PERSON> does at ` Good Morning America.' It would be very unlike me to leave on bad terms. `` As it stands now, I am staying -LRB- with NBC -RRB- in some fashion or other.'' Ms. <PERSON> Pauley </PERSON>'s agent has been negotiating with <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> since August, when Ms. <PERSON> Norville </PERSON> was promoted. <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> executives, who thought she was after more money, were startled when she submitted her resignation, according to unidentified sources cited by the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>. `` <PERSON> Deborah </PERSON> and I are on great terms. It's not <PERSON> Deborah </PERSON>'s fault she is very talented and very beautiful and younger than I,'' Ms. <PERSON> Pauley </PERSON> said. `` And my relationship with -LRB- <PERSON> Gumbel </PERSON> -RRB- is as good as it's ever been. Reports of bickering among the show's cast members have circulated since March, when a memo written by <PERSON> Gumbel </PERSON> was leaked. In the memo, he criticized his colleagues, especially weatherman <PERSON> Willard </PERSON> <PERSON> Scott </PERSON>. Ms. <PERSON> Pauley </PERSON> was not mentioned. `` We remain very, very good friends,'' Ms. <PERSON> Pauley </PERSON> said, referring to <PERSON> Gumbel </PERSON>.

<DATELINE>STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Trygve </PERSON> <PERSON> Haavelmo </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION> won the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Science today for showing that mathematical probabilities could be used to predict the puzzling shifts in the economy. <PERSON> Haavelmo </PERSON>'s work in 1941 pioneered the field of econometrics, which introduced statistical probability to economic forecasting, the <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Swedish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION> said. Colleagues said the 77-year-old <PERSON> Haavelmo </PERSON> has shunned publicity in the past and disdained awards. He was unreachable at his home in the <LOCATION> Oslo </LOCATION> suburb of <LOCATION> Baerum </LOCATION> for about five hours after the Nobel was announced. He later told the national <ORGANIZATION> NRK </ORGANIZATION> television that he was `` flustered'' and declined to be interviewed. But said he may issue a written statement later. `` I'm grateful for all the attention, but I'm a little perplexed, so I ca n't be very much help to you,'' he said. <PERSON> Haavelmo </PERSON>, a professor of economics at <ORGANIZATION> Oslo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, was the second Norwegian to win the economics prize. He was a research assistant to <PERSON> Ragnar </PERSON> <PERSON> Frisch </PERSON>, who won the prize in 1969, the first year it was awarded. The prize is worth about $ 469,000. Econometrics holds that economic theories can be proven by testing them with mathematical and statistical models. <PERSON> Assar </PERSON> <PERSON> Lindbeck </PERSON>, chairman of the prize committee, called <PERSON> Haavelmo </PERSON> `` the father of modern econometrics'' and a dominant figure in post-war economic theories. `` Through his new economic theory, scientists have learned to anticipate how governmental institutions react and how they influence people's decisions,'' <PERSON> Lindbeck </PERSON> said when announcing the prize. <PERSON> Meghnad </PERSON> <PERSON> Desai </PERSON>, a professor at the <ORGANIZATION> London </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economics </ORGANIZATION>, said: `` I'm very happy he got the prize ... There has been a tendency to give prizes to people who benefited from his work and he has been in danger of being ignored.'' <PERSON> Haavelmo </PERSON>'s 1941 doctoral thesis, which he presented at <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, `` had a swift and pathbreaking influence on the development of econometrics,'' the academy said in a summary of his achievements. His theories `` gave rise to extraordinarily rapid methodological development'' and established `` the foundation of modern econometric methods,'' the statement said. <PERSON> Haavelmo </PERSON> went to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> on a Rockefeller grant in 1939, was a professor at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> and worked for the Norwegian <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. He returned to <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION> in 1947 and has been at <ORGANIZATION> Oslo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> since 1948. <PERSON> Haavelmo </PERSON>, the son of a school administrator, is a member of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION>. He was born Dec. 13, 1911, in the Norwegian town of <LOCATION> Skedsmo </LOCATION>. The academy said <PERSON> Haavelmo </PERSON>'s theories overcame the problems economists faced because they were unable to test their ideas in the same ways as scientists who work in laboratories. Economists also could not weed out the influence of millions of individual decisions that people and companies make that disturb the models theorists devised. <PERSON> Haavelmo </PERSON> overcame these difficulties by introducing the idea of statistical probability. `` He also showed that misleading interpretations of individual relations due to interdependence can not be avoided unless all relations in a theoretical model are estimated simultaneously,'' the academy said. In such areas as investment theories and economic development, `` Haavelmo's approach has resulted in influential and far-reaching contributions,'' the academy said. The approach also has helped in the analysis of macroeconomic fluctuations, fiscal policies, and price theory,'' it said. Last year's Nobel Laureate was <PERSON> Maurice </PERSON> <PERSON> Allais </PERSON> of <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, who won the prize for his theories of how price systems can work to keep economies in balance. He was the first French economist to join the list of economic laureates. Americans have dominated the 19-year history of the prize, taking 15 of the 26 awards since it was created by the Bank of <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>. Five winners were British. The economics prize is a late addition to the five awards established in the 1896 will of <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Nobel </PERSON>, who bequeathed his fortune from the invention of dynamite to reward scientific breakthroughs, activities for peace, and literature `` of an idealistic tendency.''

<HEAD>McDonnell Douglas Drops $100 Million Prop-Fan Jet Engine</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONG BEACH, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> McDonnell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> said it is dropping its $ 100 million prop-fan jet engine program and instead will focus on a new generation of fuel-efficient aircraft. The new twin-engine, mid-range commercial transport series, dubbed the MD-90, was previewed on Tuesday. <ORGANIZATION> McDonnell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION> said it decided to drop the prop-fan engine, which it once touted as a `` step in aviation history'' because buyers are n't interested in the innovative design. `` After a number of years of research, this is what the customers are telling us they want,'' said <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Orlowski </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> McDonnell </ORGANIZATION>'s MD-90 program general manager. <ORGANIZATION> McDonnell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION> introduced the experimental prop-fan engine in February 1988. It resembled a standard jet engine housing fitted with external blades similar to light aircraft propellers, but with 16 curved blades. The novelty and designers' claims about increased fuel efficiency failed to excite customers in the airline industry, officials said. Despite projections that the engine could reduce fuel consumption by 40 percent, <ORGANIZATION> McDonnell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION> failed to get a single order for the engine type, company vice president <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON> said. `` Our customers indicated they were not interested in buying it,'' <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON> said. The gamble to develop the prop-fan engine was based on the belief that the price of jet fuel would increase in the 1980s, but prices instead held steady. The MD-90 aircrafts, which will come in two sizes, are also designed to save fuel. The 114-seat version is expected to be 13 percent more fuel efficient and the 153-seat version will save 17 percent more fuel over older aircraft models, company officials predicted. The company declined to say how much they planned to invest in the new planes, but industry analysts estimate the development cost at between $ 300 million to $ 400 million. The MD-90 series will be powered by a v2500 engine produced by the consortium <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aero </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engines </ORGANIZATION>. The consortium included American manufacturer <ORGANIZATION> Pratt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Whitney </PERSON> and the British firm <ORGANIZATION> Rolls-Royce </ORGANIZATION>, West German, Italian and Japanese companies. <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON> declined to say how many orders the company needs to receive before they begin production of the MD-90's but they have already begun their pitch to airlines to line up orders. <ORGANIZATION> McDonnell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION> hopes to begin making deliveries as early as the fourth quarter of 1994. The company spent about $ 100 million developing the prop-fan jet engines, officials said.

<HEAD>Ramada Restructuring on Hold, Company Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PHOENIX (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Ramada </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>'s restructuring, including the sale of its hotels to a <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> company, has been placed on hold, the company said today. <PERSON> Ramada </PERSON> cited `` unfavorable conditions in the high-yield credit market'' as the reason for its decision not to proceed with an offering of $ 400 million in debt securities, which is a prerequisite for the restructuring. The Phoenix-based company announced earlier this year that it would sell its worldwide hotel business to <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hotel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Holdings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> and form a new company, <ORGANIZATION> Aztar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, to operate its <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> casinos. Arranging financing for <ORGANIZATION> Aztar </ORGANIZATION> is a condition of completing the sale, <PERSON> Ramada </PERSON> said. The company originally announced that it would offer $ 170 million in first-mortgage notes and $ 230 million in bonds and, on Oct. 3, said it was considering issuing warrants for 10 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Aztar </ORGANIZATION>'s common stock. `` Ramada management intends to develop a revised restructuring proposal that will involve a modification to the consideration to be received by <ORGANIZATION> Ramada </ORGANIZATION> shareholders,'' the company said in a statement. Shareholders were to have received cash and stock in <ORGANIZATION> Aztar </ORGANIZATION> under the original plan. Any new plan would require amendment of provisions in the agreement with <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> and an extension of the Nov. 30 deadline for completing the sale, the company said. It also would require approval of shareholders and gaming regulators in <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Ramada </PERSON> said it `` can offer no assurance that a restructuring will be completed and it can not specifiy the timing of the next steps.''

<HEAD>Report: NWA to Unveil Major Jetliner Order with Boeing</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> is expected to announce as early as this week that it signed a contract for as many as 90 <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> jetliners, <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Street </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION> reported today. The order, potentially valued at $ 5 billion, would be a blow to <ORGANIZATION> Airbus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industrie </ORGANIZATION>, the European consortium that recently appeared to have gained a firm foothold with the carrier, the Journal said. Northwest also was said to be considering six firm orders and four options for new <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 747-400 jumbo jets that seat as many as 412 passengers, the Journal said. Northwest paid an estimated $ 96 million each for 747s when they were first ordered in 1985. Now, Seattle-based <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> prices the 747-400, its most expensive jetliner, at $ 116 million to $ 136 million apiece. It was n't known whether <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION>'s new owners have given final approval to all details in the order, the newspaper reported. <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Whalen </PERSON> said today the airline would have no comment on the report. `` It's no secret that we've been negotiating,'' <PERSON> Whalen </PERSON> said. But he would n't say whether the company has settled on a contract with one of the industry's three suppliers: <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Airbus </ORGANIZATION> or <ORGANIZATION> McDonnell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. Industry sources have said that <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Checchi </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> investor who led the group that recently bought <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> parent <ORGANIZATION> NWA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, has shown a strong preference for American-made aircraft, the Journal said <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Rothmeier </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> NWA </ORGANIZATION>'s recently departed chairman, had forged the carrier's recent link with <ORGANIZATION> Airbus </ORGANIZATION>, the newspaper said. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Gamble </PERSON>, public relations manager for <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commercial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airplanes </ORGANIZATION>, said today he could not confirm the report. Gamble acknowledged that <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> has been talking with <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> `` for quite some time,'' but said any announcement of orders must come from <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> customers. According to the Journal, <ORGANIZATION> Airbus </ORGANIZATION> submitted a rival bid for 40 orders and 40 options on the new stretched version of the A320, which is comparable in size to the 757. In June, <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> said it became the first carrier in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> to receive a high-technology low-noise Airbus A320 jetliner. The $ 30 million plane was the first to be delivered from an order by Northwest for 25 medium-range Airbus A320 aircraft; since June, six A320s have been delivered and are in service. The Eagan-based airline also has options for 75 additional A320 aircraft to be delivered through 1995. The total order, including spare parts, is valued at $ 3.2 billion. Northwest also has 16 <ORGANIZATION> Airbus </ORGANIZATION> A330 aircraft on order for use in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> and high-volume domestic routes. Those two-engine aircraft carry 330 passengers and cost $ 86 million each. Northwest also has on order 20 Airbus A340s, a four-engine wide-body jet that carries 280 passengers. Those jets will be used on lower-volume routes in the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> and also to provide extra capacity for very high-volume trans-Pacific routes. The company also has four options to purchase A330s or A340s, said <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>. <PERSON> Checchi </PERSON> has said he intends to take delivery of the jets ordered by <PERSON> Rothmeier </PERSON>. The 747-400 planes, which have an 8,000-mile range, are expected to be used to expand <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION>'s Pacific routes, the Journal said. The carrier already has five 747-400s in its fleet, with five more on order, <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said.

 The <ORGANIZATION> PolyGram </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> BV </ORGANIZATION> unit of Dutch-based <ORGANIZATION> NV </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Philips </ORGANIZATION> has agreed to acquire privately-owned A & amp; M Records for about $ 500 million, <ORGANIZATION> PolyGram </ORGANIZATION> officials said today. The acquisition of A & amp; M, founded 27 years ago by trumpet player <PERSON> Herb </PERSON> <PERSON> Alpert </PERSON> and his partner <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Moss </PERSON>, is the latest in a longrunning series of foreign buyouts of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> record companies. <ORGANIZATION> PolyGram </ORGANIZATION>, which says it is the world's third largest music group, said it would acquire all of A & amp; M's record operations plus its music video interests, its <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> offices, including the former <PERSON> Charlie </PERSON> <PERSON> Chaplin </PERSON> film studios, and the A & amp; M recording studio. The acquisition does not include A & amp; M's music publishing interests. <ORGANIZATION> PolyGram </ORGANIZATION> said the two founders of A & amp; M and its president, <PERSON> Gil </PERSON> <PERSON> Friesen </PERSON>, will continue their day-to-day roles at the company after the buyout. `` We are not seeing the demise of the independent record company, rather the emergence of a new brand of independent,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Fine </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> PolyGram </ORGANIZATION>'s president. He said the deal would give A & amp; M `` the resources and marketing infrastructure of a major worldwide group.'' At a news conference, Fine declined to state a precise price for the buyout, but said speculation that it was about $ 500 million `` is in the ballpark.'' A & amp; M had sales of about $ 300 million last year. A & amp; M, one of the last privately held major labels, has a talent roster headed by <PERSON> Janet </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, Sting, <PERSON> Toni </PERSON> <PERSON> Childs </PERSON>, <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Green </PERSON>, <PERSON> Brenda </PERSON> <PERSON> Russell </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Suzanne </PERSON> <PERSON> Vega </PERSON>. <PERSON> Alpert </PERSON> and <PERSON> Moss </PERSON>, who used their initials to name the company, founded it in 1962 in the garage of <PERSON> Alpert </PERSON>'s home in a <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> suburb. <PERSON> Alpert </PERSON> told reporters he was `` excited about this situation'' and that it would give A & amp; M `` more visibility and more muscle'' competing for new talent. `` I think it's the right move at the right time,'' he said. <ORGANIZATION> PolyGram </ORGANIZATION> has been interested in expanding in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, Fine said. Earlier this year it acquired <ORGANIZATION> Island </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Records </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>, which specializes in rap and reggae music, for an estimated $ 300 million. <ORGANIZATION> PolyGram </ORGANIZATION> already distributes A & amp; M records in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>; RCA records is the label's American distributor. <ORGANIZATION> PolyGram </ORGANIZATION>, 90 percent owned by Dutch electronics giant <ORGANIZATION> NV </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Philips </ORGANIZATION>, bought Island Records in August for around $ 300 million. <ORGANIZATION> PolyGram </ORGANIZATION>'s artists include <LOCATION> Bon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jovi </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Fine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Young </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cannibals </ORGANIZATION>, U2, <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Webber </PERSON> and <PERSON> Luciano </PERSON> <PERSON> Pavarotti </PERSON>. As in many other areas of the entertainment business, there has been consolidation in the records business in the past few years.

<HEAD>European Airlines Forge Ties To Form Mega-Carriers</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s airlines are rushing to join forces and forge ties with <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> and Far Eastern counterparts in an attempt to create mega-carriers in an increasingly global and competitive industry. In addition, small airlines are springing up to challenge <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s heavyweight national airlines, and the governments that own these big flag carriers are selling them gradually to private investors. These developments represent a major restructuring of the air travel industry on this side of the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION>. It's part of the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION>'s attempt to to dismantle the old airline system ahead of the end of 1992, when the 12-nation bloc will become a trade barrier-free marketplace. But there are concerns that <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s airlines may become too concentrated and powerful because the number of carriers will be reduced, hurting competition and ultimately the fare-paying passenger. Some worry that <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> could be following the path of the deregulated airline industry in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, where takeovers and consolidation have reduced the number of competitors. The move by some leading European airlines to buy stakes in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> airlines also has aroused controversy in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, where such holdings are limited to 25 percent. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> has ordered <ORGANIZATION> KLM </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dutch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> to cut its $ 400 million investment in <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>' parent company <ORGANIZATION> NWA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> to $ 176 million. Even though the planned stake came to only 5 percent, the department said the deal's size and structure might give <ORGANIZATION> KLM </ORGANIZATION> too much control. The department also might intervene in <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION>' proposal to buy a 15 percent stake in <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>' parent <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> for $ 750 million. `` There is radical change going on,'' said <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Clapham </PERSON>, a European airlines analyst with the <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> investment firm <ORGANIZATION> Hoare </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Govett </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION> `` The general climate within <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> is one of an increasing trend toward free market forces and the reduction of government influence.'' <PERSON> Hans </PERSON> <PERSON> Krakauer </PERSON>, deputy chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airline </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Passengers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, said European airlines fear the effect of liberalization on their own structure, and therefore are looking at the idea of allying themselves with erstwhile competitors. `` There is a certain fashion at the moment about joining up with somebody,'' said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Bishop </PERSON>, chairman of British <ORGANIZATION> Midland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION>. The trend-setter is Scandinavian Airlines System, the first airline to buy a stake in an American airline. A year ago it acquired 10 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, parent of <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> and Eastern airlines. <ORGANIZATION> SAS </ORGANIZATION> also holds a 25 percent stake in British <LOCATION> Midland </LOCATION> and cooperation agreements with <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s All <ORGANIZATION> Nippon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>'s Thai International. In addition, <ORGANIZATION> SAS </ORGANIZATION> plans to invest in <LOCATION> Swissair </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s largest airline, was denationalized in 1987, and has teamed with <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> for two years under a joint marketing agreement. BA also acquired smaller rival British <ORGANIZATION> Caledonian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> nearly two years ago and is seeking a joint stake with <ORGANIZATION> KLM </ORGANIZATION> in <ORGANIZATION> Sabena </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Belgian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION>. BA has attempted, but so far failed, to obtain a stake in <LOCATION> Air </LOCATION> <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION>. No. 2-ranked <ORGANIZATION> Lufthansa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> German </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> and No. 3 <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> France </ORGANIZATION>, recently announced a wide-ranging cooperation agreement that expands an existing relationship. They said they would cooperate on cargo, pilot training, aircraft purchases, marketing, catering and duty free sales. They also said they hope for a similar pact with <ORGANIZATION> Iberia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Swissair </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lines </ORGANIZATION>, meanwhile, have bought 5 percent stakes in each other. Not everybody is convinced that the airlines will benefit from such ties, but there is a growing recognition among the European carriers they are facing stiffer competition from overseas rivals, in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and elsewhere. The carriers also fear that the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION>'s 320 million people wo n't be enough to sustain <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s 21 major carriers, and that to grow, they must expand abroad In the past, it was governments that set routes, capacity and fares in bilateral agreements which often acted as effective cartels between any two given destinations. The <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION>'s governing body, has been gradually relaxing these restrictions. This liberalization is creating more choice and cheaper fares, but not fast enough, said <PERSON> Krakauer </PERSON>, from the passengers group. A good example of deregulation's potential effects comes from the <LOCATION> London-Dublin </LOCATION> route, controlled by <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Aer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lingus </ORGANIZATION> until 1986 when the governments allowed a new Irish carrier, <ORGANIZATION> Ryanair </ORGANIZATION>, into the market. Today, six airlines ply the route and <ORGANIZATION> Ryanair </ORGANIZATION>, flying to <LOCATION> Luton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> north of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, charges as little as 68 Irish pounds or about $ 96 for a round-trip, compared with 121 pounds or $ 171 on <ORGANIZATION> Aer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lingus </ORGANIZATION>, which has more daily flights and lands at <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Heathrow </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Ryanair </ORGANIZATION> is still losing money, but there has been a jump in passenger traffic through <LOCATION> Dublin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> from 2.9 million in 1986 to an estimated 5 million this year. By linking up, the airlines want to channel passengers to each other, reduce costs and gain access to crucial computer reservations systems, which are expensive and are operated mainly by the large airlines. All competitors are seeking more takeoff and landing slots at airports, one of the most important keys to profitable routes. Increased traffic has strained airport capacity and <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s complex air control system Staff shortages, outmoded equipment and strikes by air traffic controllers have turned summer travel into a regular ordeal for Europeans, and experts say the only solution is to integrate <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s 22 different national air control systems into one sprawling network. The major European airlines carried nearly 63 million passengers on scheduled European flights in 1988, up nearly 7 percent from the previous year, while 75 smaller European carriers offer scheduled international services, up from 20 in 1978, the Brussels-based <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> said. Smaller airlines are linking up with bigger ones to defend their routes. `` The small fellows are going to have to become the tail end of the big ones or come up with some brilliant commercial idea on how to stay in existence in this competition,'' <PERSON> Krakauer </PERSON> said. What worries some Europeans is the possible anti-competitive effect of joint agreements, particularly among dominant carriers, which the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> is reviewing. `` I could see big airlines preventing others from using the big airports, or preventing newcomers from having access to airports or access to computer reservations systems,'' said <PERSON> Avishai </PERSON> <PERSON> Gil </PERSON>, a transportation industry specialist with the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, a Geneva-based <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> agency. `` It really depends on the governments,'' <PERSON> Gil </PERSON> said. `` Nobody knows how things will go.'' British <LOCATION> Midland </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Bishop </PERSON> said: `` It's very important that the consequences of deregulation in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> are not repeated in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, which is a consolidation of the airlines, which is not necessarily in the interest of consumers.''

 Share prices closed unchanged Wednesday largely with the help of gains in key blue chip stocks rather than any change in sentiment over high British interest rates and a weak sterling. The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index ended at 2,218.8, unchanged from Tuesday's close, but sharply off its session high of 2,232.5. The key index rebounded late in the session from the day's low of 2,215.9 on what dealers said was some short-covering, but mostly a lack of fresh selling ahead of a potentially market-affecting speech by <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s Chancellor of the Exchequer <PERSON> Nigel </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawson </PERSON> on Thursday. Short-covering is the buying of stock to fulfill previous agreements to sell it. <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> 30-share index ended 0.6 points lower at 1,797.3. <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> 500-share index fell 1.52 points to close at 1,232.37. Volume was a modest 503.2 million shares, down from 518.8 million shares on Tuesday when <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> posted steep declines on interest rate jitters.

 Hundreds of lady beetles and wasps have been imported from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> by the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> to help <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> farmers battle the <LOCATION> Russian </LOCATION> wheat aphid. The predator insects are natural enemies of the aphid, and after evaluation may be used in field tests against the destructive pests. Such biological controls are being sought by <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> scientists as helpmates or even complete replacements for chemical pesticides. The chemicals are not only costly for farmers but can threaten food crops and the environment when used improperly. In all, three species of wasps and four species of lady beetles were collected during May and June in the southern region of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, the department's <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> reported Tuesday. Actual collecting of the hundreds of specimens was done by insect pathologist <PERSON> Tadeusz </PERSON> <PERSON> Poprawski </PERSON> and entomologist <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> <PERSON> Gruber </PERSON>, who work for the agency's parasite laboratory in <LOCATION> Behoust </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>. During their explorations, <PERSON> Poprawski </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gruber </PERSON> were based at a new Soviet-American biological control laboratory in <LOCATION> Kishinev </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Moldavia </LOCATION>. The insects were sent to a <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> laboratory in <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Del. </LOCATION>, for quarantine, rearing of new generations and distribution. The department's <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Soper </PERSON> said in a statement that the wasps and beetles `` are the first exchanges of biological pest controls to come from recent <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> research agreements with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Soper </PERSON> coordinates research on biological pest controls for the <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> agency in <LOCATION> Beltsville </LOCATION>, Md. He left on Monday for the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> to help plan next year's joint studies and explorations. The Russian wheat aphid, first spotted in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in 1986 in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, has spread to 16 states in just three years, damaging wheat, barley, rye and oats. Aphids were said to cost farmers an estimated $ 123 million last ear in grain losses and chemical controls. Officials said two species of Soviet wasps were sent in August to a <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> research unit in <LOCATION> Stillwater </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Okla. </LOCATION>, for evaluation with other wasps from <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> to determine the best candidates for field tests. Some other wasps were shipped to the department's `` mass-rearing facility'' in Mission, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, to produce more specimens. And the lady beetles are being `` multiplied'' in <LOCATION> Niles </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>. Research on the beetles will be done at the agency's facility in Brookings, S.D

 The meat business may be headed for better times if current indications prove out, says an industry spokesman. <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Manly </PERSON> <PERSON> Molpus </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Meat </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, said the overall decline in red meat consumption appears to have stabilized over the last year or so. Further, he said, there are `` solid indications'' that demand for pork is increasing. `` Retail beef prices have responded to supply shortfalls with more vigor than might have been expected after the flat-to-down trend that characterized most of the decade'' of the 1980s, <PERSON> Molpus </PERSON> said. `` And the export value of meat and meat products surpassed the value of imports for the first time ever last year.'' <PERSON> Molpus </PERSON>'s comments were in the association's Meat Facts yearbook for 1989, which was distributed Tuesday. `` Cattle numbers are at or near their cyclical low, and beef supplies will remain tight for the next several years as producers hold back cattle to expand herd sizes,'' he said. `` On the pork side, poor producer returns have likely slowed herd expansion, with the result that pork supplies could be slightly smaller next year.''

 Private exporting companies have sold the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> an additional 150,000 metric tons of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> soybean meal for delivery in 1989-90 under a long-term supply agreement. The latest sales pushed <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> soybean meal purchases by <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> to 250,000 tons for 1989-90, the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday. In addition, since the new delivery year began on Oct. 1 the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has bought 3.7 million tons of corn under the agreement. No wheat has yet been sold for 1989-90 delivery, however. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> grain sales to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> in 1988-89 were a record of more than 21.7 million tons, including more than 16.3 million tons of corn and nearly 5.4 million tons of wheat. In addition, 1988-89 sales included 442,500 tons of soybeans, 1.35 million tons of soybean meal and 1.02 million tons of grain sorghums. A metric ton is about 2,205 pounds and is equal to 39.4 bushels of corn or 36.7 bushels of wheat or soybeans. No prices or further details were announced, but the 150,000 tons of soybean meal could have a value of around $ 30 million, based on recent prices quoted at <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> processing plants.

 Stock prices lapsed into a broad decline today, continuing the pullback that began in Tuesday's session. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, down 6.08 on Tuesday, dropped 24.06 points to 2,761.27 by 2 p.m. on Wall Street. Losers outnumbered gainers by more than 5 to 2 in nationwide trading of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> Exchange-listed issues, with 370 up, 1,025 down and 511 unchanged. Analysts said traders increasingly yielded to the temptation to cash in their gains after the market's rise to record highs last week and Monday. The tendency to lighten up was apparently heightened by a dimming of hopes for any moves soon by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> to relax its credit policy. Interest rates, which had been dropping in recent days on hopes of some stimulus from the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>, were mixed in today's credit-market activity.

 <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackle </PERSON> and her husband say they lucked out by finding a reliable woman who could watch their son for $ 85 a week, though they had to make special arrangements for him to attend school near the care-giver's home miles away. `` And that's good for only one year,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Jackle </PERSON>, 37, a librarian who lives in <LOCATION> Upper </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Darby </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, near <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>. `` We're even contemplating the possibility of moving, so we could be closer to where she is. The scramble by the Jackles to find a trustworthy sitter for their 5-year-old reflects the growth in two-income families among the baby-boom generation, which in turn has created an enormous problem for working parents nationwide _ caring for their kids and paying for it. `` Nowadays, it seems if you're going to need care you'd better get set up before you get pregnant,'' said <PERSON> Louise </PERSON> <PERSON> Hurst </PERSON>, a licensed day-care professional who watches the Jackle boy and five other small children in her home. `` I've gotten lots of calls,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Hurst </PERSON>, 43. `` I inform them I'm full until September 1991, so I do n't even bother to take a waiting list.'' Demand for child care has grown so fast that costs have multiplied, in some cases nearly consuming the money earned from a second income. This has crimped budgets of millions of Americans, created an underground cash economy of unregulated care-givers, and forced many companies to offer allowances ranging from flexible work schedules to emergency sitters to attract or retain valued employees. Some prominent employers have gone further, allowing young mothers and fathers to work at home or take years off with full benefits and job guarantees. Others are building in-house day-care centers, hiring roving nannies or subsidizing the cost of care with cash payments. `` Certainly it's fashionable these days for corporations to get into this,'' said <PERSON> Antony </PERSON> <PERSON> Ward </PERSON>, director of <ORGANIZATION> Child </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Care </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> referral service retained by many companies to assist employees in finding help. `` A lot of people viscerally respond to the child-care issue,'' he said. `` Anyone who takes the kid to the family day-care provider to find a note on the door saying, ` I have the flu,' knows what it's like.'' <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> System </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Paul </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Minn. </LOCATION>, for example, has donated space in its office this year for a public kindergarten that doubles as an after-school day-care center, with priority given to children of bank employees. <ORGANIZATION> NCNB </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, a fast-growing bank in <LOCATION> Charlotte </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, plans to offer up to a 50 percent reimbursement of child-care costs to many of its workers. <ORGANIZATION> Pitney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bowes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a leading maker of business machines in <LOCATION> Stamford </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, helped pioneer flexible working hours to accommodate working parents, allowing them to arrive early some days and leave early on others. <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, the <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>, overnight delivery service, offers working parents four-day weeks and 7 a.m. to 3 p.m. shifts. Last month, seven large New York-based employers announced a pilot program of emergency child care for workers whose usual arrangements have been disrupted. The program is aimed at reducing absenteeism. `` Companies are finding that if they're not family friendly, they're losing employees,'' said <PERSON> Lorraine </PERSON> <PERSON> Dusky </PERSON>, a free-lance writer who co-authored `` The Best Companies for Women,'' a guidebook to 50 leading American corporations. `` Companies are n't doing this to be altruistic If companies do n't do something, we're in trouble. Nonetheless, the high-profile benefits of a relatively few companies mask what critics call a deepening crisis in a labor pool comprised increasingly of women, historically the primary family care-givers. Child-care activists say the majority of businesses will not concede that it's a a work-related issue, despite evidence that employer assistance leads to lower turnover, higher employee morale and improved productivity. Moreover, they say the federal government is n't providing much help. Although a bill that would vastly expand federal support for child care is working through <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, it faces the possibility of a White House veto because of the estimated $ 22.7 billion cost over the next five years. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has proposed more modest legislation that would cost $ 2.5 billion a year by 1993, mostly through tax credits. Still, that's less than $ 20 a week or about $ 1,000 a year, and would only go to lower-income families. By contrast, out-of-home, child-care costs can range from $ 1,500 to $ 10,000 a year, the <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> group </ORGANIZATION> said in a study. Other studies have shown in-home costs can go much higher. `` We have a system that has not caught up with rapid social change in our society, in which more women are back in the labor force and need child care,'' said <PERSON> Esther </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kahn </PERSON>, director of Parent's Place, a <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> counseling and referral service. `` Our society has n't provided support for families.'' A study for the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> by the <ORGANIZATION> Hudson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, an <LOCATION> Indianapolis </LOCATION> research organization, shows women now comprise nearly half the work force, compared with 38.1 percent in 1970 and 29.6 percent in 1950. Other Labor Department figures show 57 percent of all women with children under 6 work outside the home, vs. 12 percent in 1950. A study by the Children's <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION>, a Washington-based child-advocacy group, predicts two-thirds of all preschool children will have mothers in the work force by 1995. `` Only 7 percent of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> households now fit the <PERSON> Beaver </PERSON> <PERSON> Cleaver </PERSON> family's mold of breadwinning father and at-home mother,'' says a policy paper by the <ORGANIZATION> Child </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Care </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Campaign </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> coalition that advocates a national system of care. `` As female labor force participation rates continue to climb, the demand for child care will grow, too.''

 The vast majority of working parents must contend with a hodge-podge, hit-or-miss system for finding help they can trust and afford. Stories abound of care-givers and sitters who ignore, abandon, abuse or kidnap children. In a case that gained nationwide attention last March, a <LOCATION> Chattanooga </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>, sitter was sentenced to a year in jail after the parents of a 6-year-old boy secretly videotaped her viciously slapping their child. In August, a day-care provider near <LOCATION> Hartford </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, was arrested after a 3-year-old child died in the woman's locked car, evidently from heat stroke A recent article in Child magazine offered tips on how to avoid `` babysitters from hell.'' Many working parents rely on referrals from friends and relatives to hire help, but the result often is an unlicensed, untrained care-giver who can range from a total stranger to the grandmotherly widow down the block. For the Jackles and other clients of Mrs. <PERSON> Hurst </PERSON>, who found her by word-of-mouth, the main attractions included her state license to practice in-home day care, her acceptance of payment by check, her willingness to keep children until 7 p.m. and her $ 85 weekly bill, which includes food. But perhaps the biggest draw of all was Mrs. <PERSON> Hurst </PERSON>'s reliability. `` We have friends who have gone through sitters every other week,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Jackle </PERSON>, who had taken time off to raise her son for the first few years. `` For a while I was n't sure I was going back to work or not.'' The day-care dilemma has been compounded by the practice of many care-givers to take cash only, so they do n't have to report the income on their tax returns. An estimated $ 7 billion in day-care income goes unreported annually. This year for the first time, parents must provide the name and social security number of their day-care provider to the <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> to qualify for a tax credit to defray part of the cost. The <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> plans to use the information to cross-reference the returns of providers and prosecute cheaters. Day-care experts believe the law could make it even harder for parents to afford day care, since many providers will raise their rates to compensate for having to pay tax. `` It's a situation where the government has n't helped parents on child care very much at all,'' said <PERSON> Judsen </PERSON> <PERSON> Culbreth </PERSON>, editor of Working Mother magazine. `` Now they're making it even harder.'' <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Reisman </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> Child </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Care </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Campaign </ORGANIZATION>, also criticized the tax crackdown. `` Child-care workers are the lowest paid workers in this country. One of the ways people are able to survive are to be paid without having to declare the income,'' she said. `` I do n't recommend people cheat on their taxes,'' she said. `` But many parents ca n't afford to pay the full cost of care. This does n't address the real problem.''

 <PERSON> Trygve </PERSON> <PERSON> Haavelmo </PERSON>, a Norwegian professor who dislikes awards for academics, won the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Science on Wednesday for using statistics and probability to forecast how economies behave. <PERSON> Haavelmo </PERSON> `` had a swift and pathbreaking influence'' on the new science of econometrics with his probability theory, the <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Swedish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION> said in announcing the award. `` I am honored. Anyone would be. But I had nothing to do with making this award. I really have nothing to say,'' said <PERSON> Haavelmo </PERSON>, 77, in an interview. The prize `` is quite irrelevant to the real issues. I'm exhausted and I have nothing more to say,'' he added <PERSON> Haavelmo </PERSON>, who still works part time at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oslo </ORGANIZATION>, has privately voiced disdain for academic prizes, colleagues said. Tore Thornstad, a co-worker at the university, described <PERSON> Haavelmo </PERSON> as a shy, reserved person who prefers research and teaching to being in the limelight. In his 1941 doctoral dissertation for <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Haavelmo </PERSON> pioneered the field of econometrics, which introduced statistical probability to economic testing and forecasting. The thesis was published in 1944. Ten years later he published a book of his research on economic development theory. The <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION> said in its citation that <PERSON> Haavelmo </PERSON> was awarded the $ 469,000 prize `` for his clarification of the probability theory foundations of econometrics and his analyses of simultaneous economic structures.'' <PERSON> Assar </PERSON> <PERSON> Lindbeck </PERSON>, head of the academy's prize committee and a personal friend of <LOCATION> Haavelmo </LOCATION>, called him `` the father of modern econometrics'' and a dominant figure in post-war economic theories. `` As soon as you take a serious report in your hand or a long-term projection, it is econometrics that charts the relationship between all quantitative economic analyses,'' <PERSON> Lindbeck </PERSON> told reporters. <PERSON> Haavelmo </PERSON> was the second Norwegian to win the economics prize since it was introduced in 1969 by the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sweden </ORGANIZATION> and added to the five other Nobel prizes. <PERSON> Ragnar </PERSON> <PERSON> Frisch </PERSON>, who once employed <PERSON> Haavelmo </PERSON> as a a research assistant, won the prize in its inaugural year. <PERSON> Haavelmo </PERSON> is a member of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION>. He was born Dec. 13, 1911 in the town of <LOCATION> Skedsmo </LOCATION> a few miles east of <LOCATION> Oslo </LOCATION>, the son of a school administrator. He graduated from the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oslo </ORGANIZATION> in 1933.

 <ORGANIZATION> Gannett </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday that lower newsprint costs and improved cost controls at its <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Today </ORGANIZATION> newspaper helped the communications concern boost its third-quarter profit 11 percent After-tax profit for the three-month period that ended Sept. 24 totaled $ 83.1 million, or 52 cents a share, compared with $ 75.1 million, or 47 cents a share, for the same period in 1988. Third-quarter operating revenue grew by 3 percent to $ 827.9 million from $ 804.3 million. In a letter to shareholders, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Curley </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Gannett </ORGANIZATION>'s chairman and president, said the third-quarter figures reflected `` lower newsprint costs and a substantial improvement in the results of <LOCATION> USA </LOCATION> Today,'' <ORGANIZATION> Gannett </ORGANIZATION>'s national newspaper, through `` effective cost controls.'' For the first nine months of 1989, profits were up 11 percent to $ 270.1 million _ or $ 1.68 per share _ compared with $ 246.6 million _ or $ 1.52 per share _ for the same period of 1988. Revenue for the first nine months totaled $ 2.5 billion, up nearly 6 percent from $ 2.4 billion in the same period last year. <LOCATION> Rosslyn </LOCATION>, Va.-based <ORGANIZATION> Gannett </ORGANIZATION> operates in 41 states, the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> and seven overseas locations. The news and information giant publishes 83 daily newspapers, operates 10 television stations, 16 radio stations, <ORGANIZATION> Gannett </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> and the largest outdoor advertising company in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. Operating income advanced 7 percent to $ 166 million in the third period compared with $ 155.6 million in the third quarter a year ago. While newspaper advertising circulation revenues increased 3 percent for the quarter, run-of-page newspaper linage was off due to a drop in retail and national advertising. <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Today </ORGANIZATION>'s paid advertising pages totaled 785, down from the 865 for the same period last year when the Summer Olympics boosted summer ad demand, the company reported. For the year to date, paid advertising pages totaled 2,735, down from 2,847 for the same nine-month period in 1988. Because of rate adjustments and a higher rate base, <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Today </ORGANIZATION>'s advertising revenue climbed 8 percent for the third quarter and 13 percent for the year to date, said <ORGANIZATION> Gannett </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gannett </ORGANIZATION> said its third-quarter broadcasting revenue of $ 89.62 million was nearly the same as the $ 89.7 million for the same period in 1988.

The <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> crop report, scheduled for release after Thursday's close, is expected to indicate slightly larger corn and soybean harvests than the <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION>'s September estimates of 1.89 billion bushels of soybeans and 7.32 billion bushels of corn A survey of private crop analysts taken earlier this week showed estimates averaging 1.92 billion bushels of soybeans and 7.4 billion bushels of corn. But estimates released late Tuesday by respected private crop analyst <PERSON> Conrad </PERSON> <PERSON> Leslie </PERSON> came in slightly below those averages, prompting some buying of futures this morning. Analysts also attributed Wednesday's modest rally to buying inspired by the soybean market's tumble to 23-month lows on Tuesday. `` The markets have really gotten battered around and were oversold,'' said <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> <PERSON> Karlin </PERSON>, an analyst in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> with <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, which provides research services to brokers.

<HEAD>Chase Posts $1.12 Billion Loss As Expected</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Chase </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manhattan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> reported Wednesday that it lost $ 1.12 billion in the third quarter, in line with projections made a month ago when it decided to substantially boost its loan-loss reserves to cover problem Third World debt. The loss for the three months ended Sept. 30 amounted to $ 12.45 a share, compared with a profit of $ 283 million, or $ 3.09 a share, recorded the same period a year ago. Excluding the higher reserves, as well as other special provisions taken in the third quarter, <PERSON> Chase </PERSON> said it would have earned $ 151 million, or $ 1.45 a share. It said its 1988 third quarter earnings, would have totaled $ 130 million, or $ 1.32 a share, minus special gains from income tax benefits and its pension plan. <PERSON> Chase </PERSON> said this year's third quarter included increases in net interest income, consumer and investment banking fees and trading account income. Income from foreign exchange trading declined from the year-earlier quarter. For the first nine months of 1989, <ORGANIZATION> Chase </ORGANIZATION>'s net loss totaled $ 840 million, or $ 10.01 per share, compared with net income of $ 784 million, or $ 8.62 per share a year earlier. Excluding the impact of the special provisions, <PERSON> Chase </PERSON> would have netted $ 420 million, or $ 4.04 a share. <PERSON> Chase </PERSON>, the nation's second-largest banking company after <ORGANIZATION> Citicorp </ORGANIZATION>, with assets of around $ 106 billion, had said it expected to lose $ 1.12 billion in the third quarter of this year when it announced a major recapitalization plan on Sept. 20. The plan, which resulted in a total after-tax charge of $ 1.26 billion, included the addition of $ 1.15 billion to its loan-loss reserves for Third World debt, an $ 85 million charge reflecting the lower value of problem real estate assets in <LOCATION> Chase </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> banking subsidiary and a $ 25 million charge relating to securities trading activities. <PERSON> Chase </PERSON> had also said it would issue $ 500 million in new common stock. Two other major <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> banks, <ORGANIZATION> J.P. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morgan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hanover </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, also sharply boosted their loan-loss reserves last month. The moves reflected a growing realization among bankers that the money lent to Third World countries in the 1970s to spur economic growth may never be fully repaid. Manufacturers Hanover added $ 950 million to its reserves in the third quarter for a projected $ 775 million loss, while <ORGANIZATION> Morgan </ORGANIZATION> raised reserves by $ 2 billion and said it expected a $ 1.8 billion quarterly loss. <PERSON> Chase </PERSON> said its reserve for possible credit losses from Third World countries totaled $ 2.9 billion the end of the third quarter, or roughly 46 percent of Chase's total $ 6.2 billion of medium - and long-term loans to Third World countries The ratio was 24 percent at the end of the 1988 third quarter, when reserves were $ 1.9 billion.

 Stock prices showed a broad loss today, continuing the pullback that began in Tuesday's session. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, down 6.08 on Tuesday, dropped 20.78 points to 2,764.55 by 3 p.m. on Wall Street.

 An attempt by <ORGANIZATION> Gulf </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> States </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Utilities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> to make customers pay $ 1.4 billion of the costs of the <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bend </LOCATION> nuclear power plant was rejected Wednesday by a state judge. District Judge <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Landry </PERSON> backed a contention by the <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> that the costs were imprudent and should not be passed on to customers in their electric rates. However, <PERSON> Landry </PERSON>'s order left open the possibility of the costs being brought into the rate structure by the <ORGANIZATION> PSC </ORGANIZATION> in the future. The <ORGANIZATION> PSC </ORGANIZATION> had argued that <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> should have built a less expensive electric generating plant fueled by lignite coal. The decision sent the company's stock reeling. In late afternoon trading on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Gulf </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> States </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Utilities </ORGANIZATION> was the most active issue and tumbled $ 2.50 a share to $ 11.75. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON>, an attorney for <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, said he would review the decision before deciding whether to appeal. <PERSON> Landry </PERSON> rejected a motion by state Attorney General <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Guste </PERSON> to disallow all costs associated with <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bend </LOCATION> from the rate base. The commission earlier agreed to allow <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to include $ 1.6 billion in costs from the plant. `` In my opinion, this defeats the entire purpose of regulation,'' said Assistant Attorney General <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> McNeill </PERSON>. `` For the next who knows how many years, the $ 1.4 billion hangs over the heads of the rate payers ...'' But <ORGANIZATION> PSC </ORGANIZATION> member <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Lambert </PERSON> said the decision means rate payers `` wo n't be charged for $ 1.4 billion of <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bend </LOCATION> nuclear plant because the court held that <ORGANIZATION> GSU </ORGANIZATION> had enough information at the time to know they should have built a lignite coal unit.'' The long-running dispute between <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> PSC </ORGANIZATION> stems from the utility's decision in 1979 to proceed with the construction of <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bend </LOCATION>, located near <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> La </LOCATION>. Company officials said the decision was based upon the best possible information about future electric needs in <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> and the type of fuel that should be used to generate power. The <ORGANIZATION> PSC </ORGANIZATION> contended that <ORGANIZATION> GSU </ORGANIZATION> continued with construction plans only to recoup its costs after a buyer could not be found for the $ 4.5 billion project. The plant began commercial operation in 1986. <ORGANIZATION> Cajun </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cooperative </ORGANIZATION> shared in the construction costs. <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> serves about 500,000 customers in <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> and southeastern <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>.

 The dollar gained more ground Wednesday against most major foreign currencies despite heavy selling by central banks and a surprise hike in the Japanese discount rate. Gold prices rose after falling slightly overseas. On the Commodity Exchange in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, gold bullion for current delivery closed at $ 362 a troy ounce, a $ 1 increase from Tuesday. <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> quoted a late bid for gold at $ 361.50 an ounce, up 50 cents. Currency dealers said the dollar initially fell after the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> announced it would hike its discount rate _ the interest rate charged to member banks _ to 3.75 percent from 3.25 percent. But the dollar soon shrugged off that unexpected news as well as reports of widespread intervention by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> and several European central banks, they said. `` All rabbits have been pulled out of the hat and the dollar still is n't going down,'' said a senior dealer at a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> investment bank in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. Another European dealer said the central bank dollar-selling was effective only in `` taking the sting out of what looked to be a fairly vicious upward move.'' <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON>, manager of corporate foreign exchange for <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Capital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Markets </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, said the dollar was being supported by the belief that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> interest rates would hold steady. <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> hinted during a meeting in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> on Tuesday that rates would stay firm in the near term regardless of the currency's movements. He expressed concern that `` attempts to maintain unrealistic exchange rates may lead to destabilizing international capital flows ...'' Those remarks helped push the dollar sharply higher in Tuesday trading, since firmer interest rates tend to support a currency. <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> predicted that `` without a rate cut by the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> ... the dollar is not going to come off.'' In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, where trading ends before <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s business day begins, the dollar rose 1.67 yen from Monday to close at 143.90 yen. <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>'s markets were closed Tuesday for a national holiday. The yen was quoted at 144.50 yen in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, and 144.50 yen in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, unchanged. The British pound continued to lose ground against the dollar. It cost $ 1.5425 for one pound in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, cheaper than $ 1.5580 late Tuesday. Sterling fetched $ 1.5460 in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, down from $ 1.5520.

<HEAD>Fall 11 Percent in Third Quarter</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> reported a 11 percent decline in third-quarter earnings Wednesday, primarily because a severe drop in income from joint ventures offset gains in television advertising. The network said it earned $ 61.8 million or $ 2.40 a share in the three months ended Sept. 30, compared with $ 69.8 million or $ 2.72 a share in the year-earlier period. Third-quarter sales totaled $ 593.5 million vs. $ 568 million, a 4 percent increase. <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> attributed most of the earnings drop to an 82.6 percent decline in third-quarter income from <ORGANIZATION> CBS-Fox </ORGANIZATION>, a joint venture between <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Twentieth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Century </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fox </ORGANIZATION> that markets and distributes home videcassettes. <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> said it earned $ 1.2 million from the joint venture in the period, vs. $ 6.9 million a year ago. President and Chief Executive Officer <PERSON> Laurence </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Tisch </PERSON> said that despite the decline, the company's key television operations were performing well, helped by gains in ad income, no unusual disruptions to the fall season, and lower costs from the absence of presidential campaign coverage this year. `` With a robust advertising market and better ratings over last year's strike-disrupted program schedule, the <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION> is expected to show imrpoved results for the balance of the year,'' <PERSON> Tisch </PERSON> said. For the first nine months of 1989, <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> said it earned $ 236.9 million or $ 9.21 a share, a 3 percent decline from the $ 243.3 million or $ 9.46 million a share earned in the year-earlier period. Sales totaled $ 2.1 billion vs. $ 2.0 billion, a 5 percent increase. If discontinued operations from 1988 are included in the figures, earnings for the first nine months of 1989 would have fallen 79 percent from a year earlier, when company earnings were inflated by $ 866.6 million from the sale of its records subsidiary to <ORGANIZATION> Sony </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>Rumors, Questions Swirl Around Icahn's Plans for TWA</HEAD>

 When you have an airline for sale, who do you call? Do n't ask <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON>. <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON>, the takeover specialist who completed his $ 1.2 billion buyout of <ORGANIZATION> Trans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> last year, has been rumored for several months to be looking to unload the airline through a sale or merger or another kind of management change. <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> employees have heard through the grapevine that <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> has talked with other major airlines, other takeover experts, even <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis-based </LOCATION> corporate giants <ORGANIZATION> Anheuser-Busch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cos. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> McDonnell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION> The brewer and the aircraft maker often are approached to help bail out local companies and institutions. <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> could fit nicely with <ORGANIZATION> McDonnell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION>, the world's second-largest builder of commercial jets after <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> also had expressed interest some months ago in strikebound <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, hinting at a possible merger between <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> The latest speculation comes against a background of takeover fever sweeping the nation's airline industry. An investor group recently acquired <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> parent <ORGANIZATION> NWA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> for $ 3.65 billion, while a pilot-management coalition is trying to buy <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>' parent, for $ 6.75 billion. Just last week, developer <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> made a record $ 7 billion offer for <ORGANIZATION> AMR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which owns <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> _ the nation's largest and most profitable. <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Buckstein </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION>'s general counsel at its corporate headquarters in Mt. <PERSON> Kisco </PERSON>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, declined comment Wednesday on the rumors concerning <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON>. `` No Mr. Right has come out of the woodwork,'' said <PERSON> Morten </PERSON> <PERSON> Beyer </PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Avmark </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, an aviation consulting firm based in <LOCATION> Arlington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION> `` I would say there certainly has n't been a stampede to buy <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION>.'' But <PERSON> Beyer </PERSON> and other analysts said it's clear that something needs to be done to help <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION>, which began this decade as the nation's second-largest airline and is now near the bottom of the list of majors. Will <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> end up as part of an airline merger? <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Daugherty </PERSON>, an airline analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Dean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Witter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reynolds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, said he does n't think so. `` I do n't think the government would allow it,'' <PERSON> Daugherty </PERSON> said. `` The USAir-Piedmont merger barely squeaked by and I do n't see a <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> merger with a major carrier making it.'' If it's not another airline, then it's anybody's guess what will happen. <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> workers are just hoping something happens soon. The waiting is becoming unbearable, said <PERSON> Herb </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> union's Local 1650. `` It's a tremendous amount of stress on our people. The anxiety is growing,'' said <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, who's based in <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo. </LOCATION>, where <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> has a large maintenance facility. `` Our people are trying to plan vacations, or trying to figure out whether to buy a new car, just like everyone else in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said. `` But we ca n't do anything because we do n't know if we'll have a job when we wake up.'' The rumors have been passed around the workplace for so long, he said, that nobody knows what to expect. `` It's really become a joke,'' <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said. Analysts say several major problems have contributed to the decline of <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> and are probably also keeping suitors from rushing to buy the airline. Chief among the troubles are financial woes. Through the first half of the year, <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> reported losses of $ 87.5 million, while many of the nation's other major carriers have been posting record profits. The company, which <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> took private last October, also has to repay $ 400 million in interest payments this year and has $ 1.7 billion in principal and interest payments coming due in later years. The airline also has a fairly dissatisfied workforce. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> aircraft mechanics have n't received a raise in five years, while ticket agents and reservation clerks are being paid the same amount they were in 1980. The 16,000 <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> employees in the <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> union have been working under a contract that expired last October. The airline's pilots, among the lowest paid among major carriers, are continuing a lawsuit challenging the manner in which <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> took the company private The pilots lost the suit in <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> and have appealed that decision, according to <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Berkeley </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> pilots. Another big concern is the age of <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION>'s fleet, the second-oldest among major <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> carriers. The company has ordered 40 new planes from <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Airbus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industrie </ORGANIZATION>, but the first shipment of 20 of those jets wo n't be ready until 1994.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Unisys </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> entered the emerging market of digital image processing Wednesday with two systems that will allow crisp images of checks and blueprints to be stored electronically. The company's Image Item Processing System will be available in the first quarter of 1990 for an average of $ 1.5 million to $ 3 million. Combined with the software Image Check Processing System, it will allow high-speed image processing of payment items for the banking industry. The Unisys InfoImage Engineering Document Management System, available now starting at $ 500,000, allows storage of such documents as blueprints, engineering drawings, charts and building diagrams. Software permits the digitized documents to be indexed and called up onto display work stations along with data in other computer systems. `` <ORGANIZATION> Unisys </ORGANIZATION> is committed to a leadership role in the imaging revolution, which will produce more than $ 5 billion in revenue by 1992, up from $ 800 million in 1988,'' said L.W. `` Roy'' Beers, vice president for document imaging systems. <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Farkas </PERSON>, vice president for financial and imaging programs, said imaging allows banks to reduce the repeated physical handling of paper items, which leads to processing errors. Savings in labor and other costs will pay for the system in about three years, he said. `` We're looking at this as a major growth area for the company,'' he said. <ORGANIZATION> Unisys </ORGANIZATION> expects to capture 40 percent to 45 percent of a projected $ 2.3 billion payment-item processing market by 1993, of which $ 1.2 billion will be in imaging, he said. <ORGANIZATION> Unisys </ORGANIZATION> currently has about a 25 percent share of the $ 850 million traditional processing market worldwide, he said. <ORGANIZATION> Chase </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manhattan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Huntington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bancshares </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Northern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> have announced plans to use the check-processing system, <ORGANIZATION> Unisys </ORGANIZATION> said. <ORGANIZATION> Rolls-Royce </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, the high-technology defense contracting subsidiary of <ORGANIZATION> Rolls-Royce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION>, will use the document system. <ORGANIZATION> Unisys </ORGANIZATION> said last month it had formed a corporate office for imaging systems to coordinate a comprehensive strategic commitment to document and payment imaging systems. It said technology had progressed to the point where imaging systems could generate fast payback and cost savings to a broad range of users. In recent weeks, <ORGANIZATION> Unisys </ORGANIZATION> also announced a series of strategic relationships with industry-leading image technology vendors to integrate their innovative technology into <ORGANIZATION> Unisys </ORGANIZATION> information management systems.

 Stock prices declined for the second straight session Wednesday in selling attributed to new interest-rate worries and uneasiness about prospects for several pending and rumored buyouts.

<HEAD>Third-Quarter Earnings Expected to Tumble</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FREDERICK STANDISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Auto Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Third-quarter earnings for the nation's Big Three automakers are expected to tumble from last year's levels, primarily because of sales incentive costs, analysts say. On the balance sheet, incentive costs come directly out of North American operations. <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> have profitable overseas operations, especially in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, but <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> does n't. Consequently, <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION>'s earnings could take a big hit when the Big Three report their earnings during the week of Oct. 23. Incentive costs, sometimes called marketing expenses, have been heavy during the second and third quarters of 1989 for the Big Three. Each embarked on extensive rebate and low-interest financing programs as the second quarter began and continued them through the third quarter, mostly to remove built up inventories before the 1990 model year began Oct. 1. `` You know what's a killer? Marketing expenses, which could be as high as $ 1,000 a car,'' said analyst <PERSON> Kathleen </PERSON> <PERSON> Heaney </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Nikko </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> Analysts estimates of third-quarter earnings vary greatly, but each is significantly lower for each company compared to the same three-month period a year ago. During the third quarter of 1988, the Big Three earned a combined $ 1.83 billion, or $ 3.51 a share, to post the best third quarter in history. This year, combined earnings should be somewhere around $ 1.02 billion, or about $ 1.95 a share, analysts figures show. That's down 44.3 percent. `` It's not going to be a pretty quarter,'' said analyst <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Laughlin </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Bear </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stearns </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. He attributed nearly all the sour performance to <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> operations, as did independent analyst <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Healy </PERSON>. `` I think chances are that a break even or loss in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> operations will affect all three,'' <PERSON> Healy </PERSON> said. Even though incentives eat into profits, none of the Big Three are shying away from them so far in the fourth quarter. <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> have offered rebates, low-interest financing or specialized promotions nationwide and regionally for 1989 and 1990 cars. Some of the programs were introduced on 1990 vehicles even before the cars and trucks officially went on sale. Less profitable North American operations affect not only the balance sheet for the corporation but profit sharing for the companies' workers. Each contract between a Big Three automaker and the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Auto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> union contains a formula for figuring profit sharing checks for the workers. The amount of the check is directly related to the profitability of a company's operations in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>.

 <ORGANIZATION> Hilton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hotels </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> reported a 2.9 percent rise in earnings Wednesday for its third quarter, with increased hotel profits offset by lower returns from casinos. Separately, spokesman <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Lebo </PERSON> said several suitors had signed confidentiality agreements to examine <ORGANIZATION> Hilton </ORGANIZATION>'s books as the corporation continues its `` slow and deliberate'' effort to sell itself. For the third quarter ended Sept. 30, <ORGANIZATION> Hilton </ORGANIZATION> said it earned $ 28.1 million, or 58 cents per share, on revenues of $ 248.5 million. In the same period last year, <ORGANIZATION> Hilton </ORGANIZATION> earned $ 27.3 million, or 57 cents per share, on revenues of $ 236.1 million. Hotel income for the period rose 36 percent to $ 28.5 million, but was partially offset by $ 1.5 million in start-up costs at new properties, <ORGANIZATION> Hilton </ORGANIZATION> said. Gaming income fell 10 percent to $ 29.7 million. Corporate expenses rose 79 percent to $ 10.4 million, mainly because of unanticipated settlement costs relating to a property deal in an earlier year, <ORGANIZATION> Hilton </ORGANIZATION> said. For the nine months ended Sept. 30, <ORGANIZATION> Hilton </ORGANIZATION> said its earnings fell 14 percent to $ 83.2 million, or $ 1.72 per share, from $ 95.7 million, or $ 1.99 a share, a year earlier. Nine-month revenue rose 6 percent to $ 738.6 million from $ 699.2 million a year earlier. In August, after settlement of the contested will of founder <PERSON> Conrad </PERSON> <PERSON> Hilton </PERSON>, the company put itself up for sale. Some analysts estimated it could fetch more than $ 6 billion. <PERSON> Lebo </PERSON> declined to identify suitors or to say how many had entered into confidentiality agreements.

<HEAD>Glazer Group Seeks Clearance To Increase Harley-Davidson Stake</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A group led by businessman <PERSON> Malcolm </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Glazer </PERSON> said Wednesday it had requested federal permission to increase its stake in the motorcycle manufacturer <ORGANIZATION> Harley-Davidson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> to 15 percent. The investor group said in a statement issued at its <LOCATION> Rochester </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION> headquarters that it was still studying `` a full range of options'' regarding its stake in <LOCATION> Harley </LOCATION>, the last remaining <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> maker of motorcycles. The group currently holds 6.24 percent of <PERSON> Harley </PERSON>'s stock. There has been speculation that <PERSON> Glazer </PERSON>, who has made takeover bids for other companies in the past, might launch a bid for <PERSON> Harley </PERSON>. <PERSON> Harley </PERSON> responded to Wednesday's announcement by reiterating its intention to remain independent. `` The company is not for sale,'' spokeswoman <PERSON> Katherine </PERSON> <PERSON> Holaday </PERSON> said from <PERSON> Harley </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> Milwaukee </LOCATION> office. She said <PERSON> Harley </PERSON> has had no contact from <PERSON> Glazer </PERSON> or his group, and she added, `` I think at this point any speculation about -LRB- a possible takeover bid -RRB- would certainly be premature.'' <PERSON> Harley </PERSON> stock was unchanged at $ 40.75 a share in <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> composite trading Wednesday. <PERSON> Glazer </PERSON>'s group announced on Oct. 2 it had accumulated 6.24 percent of <PERSON> Harley </PERSON> stock. Under federal law, an investor must apply for clearance from the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> to acquire a stake of 15 percent or more in a company. Last year, <PERSON> Glazer </PERSON> bought 9.9 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Formica </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s stock and offered to buy the entire company. His overtures were rejected and a management-led group subsequently took Formica private. <PERSON> Glazer </PERSON> is chairman of <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Allied </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which he said has interests in more than 30 companies in 12 states, including television stations, real estate, health care and banking.

 With his dapper suits, executive salary and swank office equipped with a kitchen and shoe-polish machine, <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> seems an unlikely leader of the knock-down, drag-out machinists strike against <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co </ORGANIZATION>. Since becoming president of <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lodge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> 751 </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aerospace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> in 1980, <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> has been criticized by dissidents in the aerospace giant's largest union for what they call his coziness with management. At age 52, a rural <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION> native who went from seaman to <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> electronics technician before making organized labor his career, he was far from itching to strike. Nonetheless, he recommended rejection of a three-year contract matching or exceeding most major recent settlements nationally. A strike was approved on an 85 percent vote Oct. 3. `` Sometimes it takes a strike to get what you want, but if there is a long strike, some people can wind up suffering,'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said. `` That's the part I do n't like.'' The offer included 4 percent raises the first year and 3 percent in each of the next two years, productivity bonuses of 8 percent of gross pay the first year and 3 percent the second year, less mandatory overtime and more benefits. Union members, whose tasks range from riveting to delicate instrument calibrations, were making $ 17,534 to $ 37,377 a year before the strike. <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> <PERSON> Hammond </PERSON>, a federal mediator who assisted in pre-strike contract negotiations, could n't predict the outcome of the strike vote by 40,000 union members. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> was certain. `` He really has a feel for the people he represents,'' <PERSON> Hammond </PERSON> said. Dissident <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Knowles </PERSON>, 51, a toolmaker and 24-year union member from <LOCATION> Everett </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION>, emphasized that despite his criticisms of <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, `` I never said he was stupid.'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>'s predecessor, <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Wydick </PERSON>, led the last strike against <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION>, a 45-day walkout in 1977. In 1980 <PERSON> Wydick </PERSON> withdrew from an election battle with <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> in exchange for a better paying, less stressful union job. `` I do not believe he had the basic abilities that <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> has ... the savvy, the intelligence,'' <PERSON> Knowles </PERSON> said. Favoring natty three-piece suits, sporting an impeccably trimmed mustache and carefully coiffed silver hair, soft-spoken and cautious, <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> was the first to win three consecutive terms of what is now the largest of <ORGANIZATION> IAM </ORGANIZATION>'s 162 district lodges without a ballot opponent. `` I think he really typifies the local leadership'' of the Machinists nationwide, said <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> president <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Kourpias </PERSON>. `` He's a good administrator,'' <PERSON> Kourpias </PERSON> said. `` He's also a good leader. He has brought some stability to that district lodge.'' Critics say <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> has artfully ensured that only his supporters were elected to the District Council. Only council members, chosen from the district's seven locals, may run for president. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Finnegan </PERSON>, a machine operator and 35-year <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> employee in <LOCATION> Auburn </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION>, who lost his <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> seat to a Baker supporter, said the president would have lost had he faced ballot opposition. Even with the strike, <PERSON> Finnegan </PERSON> said, `` a lot of people figure he's just too cozy with the company.'' Anti-Baker leaflets circulated through <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> plants last year titled `` Truth Not Trivia'' zeroed in on a 17.5 percent increase in base salary for <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> in 1987, lavish travel spending and the $ 9.4 million spent on `` <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>'s Taj Mahal,'' a brick-and-glass edifice featuring a soaring glass atrium that opened in July a few blocks from <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> headquarters. The president's suite includes a fully equipped kitchen, a conference table and easel, a row of model Boeings on a shelf, an electric rotary shoe buffer, couch, easy chairs and coffee table. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, who received $ 75,343 in salary and per diem and $ 27,546 for expenses last year for a total compensation of $ 102,889, dismissed critics as petty carpers `` who do n't stand for something.'' The building replaced a 40-year-old cramped and outmoded union hall, and an image of `` permanence and strength'' was essential, he asserted. Rarely does <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> raise his voice, even at times like a visit to the picket line outside <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> headquarters the day the strike began. Wearing a blue union sweatshirt over jeans and white athletic shoes, he waved his picket sign high, grinning. As head of the 43,300 <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> machinists in the <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> area _ nearly four-fifths of the 57,800 workers represented by the union nationwide _ <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> has visited the picket lines daily. He has a <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> family. Two sons, ages 30 and 28, are on strike, as is his 25-year-old daughter and two of their spouses. The younger son's wife, a salaried employee at <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION>, remains on the job. In even tones bearing unmistakeable traces of the <LOCATION> Ozark </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountains </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> described a rural childhood of hardship. He was born in <LOCATION> Harrison </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ark. </LOCATION>, but the family moved to the <LOCATION> Bakersfield </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, area when he was young. His father worked on irrigation systems and picked cotton. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> later joined his father in the fields, cramming in schoolwork between seasons. In about the fifth or sixth grade, he contracted rheumatic fever and the family returned to <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION> because his parents thought it would improve his health. He later completed high school there and joined the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>. `` When they said, ` We'll give you a free airplane ticket,' I said, ` I'm yours,'' he recalled. After four years at sea, where he began working with electronics, he found work at <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION>, mostly dealing with ballistic missile circuitry and control systems. `` The union was not something I had given any thought to, but I happened to hit a shop that was well-organized ... with good, strong exposure to union people,'' he said. In about 1959 he became a shop steward and eventually went on to become a local president and a business representative. In his first campaign for district president, he joined a groundswell of feeling that incumbent <PERSON> Wydick </PERSON> was weak. Three years later <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> clashed with <PERSON> Justin </PERSON> <PERSON> Ostro </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> IAM </ORGANIZATION> vice president who coordinates aerospace industry negotiations, over a contract offer that _ for the first time _ sacrificed wage increases in favor of bonuses. <PERSON> Ostro </PERSON> urged members to reject the contract. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said vote yes. The members followed <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>. In 1986, despite a determined union effort to return to increases in basic wage rates, a narrowly approved contract provided only another round of bonuses. This year, citing an extensive survey showing 62 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> workers wanted wage gains, <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> made the issue a contract demand. <PERSON> Kourpias </PERSON> dismissed <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>'s past clashes with the international leadership, or Grand Lodge and asserted hehad worked closely with him `` from the day he was elected.'' <PERSON> Kourpias </PERSON> also said <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> would be a strong candidate for a higher position within the parent union, but <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said he's not interested. `` I think this job is really a better job than the vice president's job in the -LRB- parent -RRB- union. Here I can make things happen,'' he said.

<HEAD>Pork Belly Market Surges As Supplies Decline</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 Frozen pork belly futures prices climbed sharply Wednesday on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, boosted by stronger cash markets, shrinking supplies and bullish technical signals. On other commodity markets, livestock, energy and precious metals were mostly higher while grain futures were mixed. Frozen pork bellies settled 1.10 cents to 1.22 cents higher with the contract for delivery in February at 47.72 cents a pound. The rally erased most of the losses piled up in the three previous sessions. Pork belly prices have been recovering slowly since early September after sliding to 18-year lows during the summer as supplies piled up in warehouses, a function of declining consumption of bacon, which is made from pork bellies. The government's decision to include pork bellies in food aid to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> helped get the market moving again last month, as did a drop in retail bacon prices to levels that some consumers apparently found irresistible. On Sept. 22, the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> reported a record 45.4-million-pound drop in frozen pork belly stocks from Aug. 1 to Sept. 1, to 50 million pounds. More recent statistics indicate the stockpile continues to shrink. The <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday reported a 2.4-million-pound decline last week in bellies stored in warehouses outside of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. `` As much as anything, the bellies are getting energy from fairly good out-movement,'' said <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> Durchholz </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> AgriVisor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Bloomington </LOCATION>, Ill. Meanwhile, the dry, sunny weather of the past month has kept many pork producers focused on harvesting corn and soybeans instead of marketing hogs, temporarily reducing hog supplies and forcing meatpackers to pay more for the animals and charge more for pork products. This kink in the pork pipeline is a seasonal phenomenon but `` it's kind of extraordinary this year,'' <PERSON> Durchholz </PERSON> said, because the harvesting weather has been unusually good. Another analyst, <ORGANIZATION> Dale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Benson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Witter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reynolds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, said the rally was also linked to technical buy signals, especially the February contract's dip below 47 cents a pound, which triggered large-scale buying. On the livestock markets, live cattle futures settled .10 cent to .35 cent higher with October at 73.20 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .20 cent to .60 cent higher with October at 83.15 cents a pound; live hogs were .30 cent lower to .40 cent higher with October at 47.62 cents a pound. Energy futures prices settled mostly higher on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> in a session dominated by technical factors. West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 10 cents lower to 8 cents higher with November at $ 20.25 a barrel; heating oil was .11 cent to .22 cent higher with November at 59.81 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was .26 cent lower to .67 cent higher with November at 55.73 cents a gallon. Gold futures were slightly higher while silver made substantial gains on <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. Analysts said silver was due for a correction after sinking 23 cents an ounce in the last four sessions. Gold finished 90 cents to $ 1 higher with October at $ 362 a troy ounce; silver was 4.3 cents to 5 cents higher with December at $ 5.143 a troy ounce. Most soybean and corn futures advanced slightly on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> as traders fine-tuned their positions ahead of Thursday's <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> crop report. Most wheat futures posted modest losses, reflecting a lack of new export demand. The <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> crop report, scheduled for release after Thursday's close, is expected to indicate slightly larger corn and soybean harvests than the <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION>'s September estimates of 1.89 billion bushels of soybeans and 7.32 billion bushels of corn Wheat futures settled 2 -RCB- cents lower to -LCB- cent higher with the contract for delivery in December at $ 4.04 \ a bushel; corn futures were \ cent to 1 -RCB- cents higher with December at $ 2.35 a bushel; oats were -LCB- cent lower to -RCB- cent higher with December at $ 1.40 -LCB- a bushel; soybeans were unchanged to 3 cents higher with November at $ 5.52 \ a

<TEXT>
 May <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday it has sold its 118 <ORGANIZATION> Caldor </ORGANIZATION> discount stores to an investor group that includes senior management and is spinning off its Venture discount chain in order to concentrate on its higher-return and faster-growing businesses. May, one of the nation's leading department store companies, said Wednesday it had agreed to sell <ORGANIZATION> Caldor </ORGANIZATION> for $ 500 million cash and $ 52 million in other considerations to <ORGANIZATION> CAL </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Holdings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> CAL </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Holdings </ORGANIZATION> is a new company formed by <ORGANIZATION> Odyssey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partners </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> L.P. </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Caldor </ORGANIZATION> management led by <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Clarke </PERSON>, chairman and chief executive officer, <PERSON> Marc </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Balmuth </PERSON>, president, and others; and <ORGANIZATION> Donaldson </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lufkin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Jenrette </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Capital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> CAL </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Holdings </ORGANIZATION> will assume $ 52 million in <ORGANIZATION> Caldor </ORGANIZATION> debt and capitalized lease operations, May spokesman <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> <ORGANIZATION> Caldor </ORGANIZATION> is located primarily in the Northeast. May, which has been trying to sell its two discount operations for several months, also announced a plan to spin off its Venture division of 75 discount stores in eight states in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION>. Plans, which are subject to a favorable ruling by the <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, call for Venture to borrow money, which it then would pay to <PERSON> May </PERSON> as compensation for separating itself from May. May would distribute stock in Venture to its shareholders, <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> said. `` We have done what we said we were going to do in late June,'' <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> said. He said he could not place a dollar value on the Venture spinoff. Analysts, however, estimate that the Venture move will raise $ 300 million, which they expect May to use for further acquisitions in the retail field. <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Kristiansen </PERSON> of <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> <PERSON> Witter </PERSON> said she had expected the <ORGANIZATION> Caldor </ORGANIZATION> and Venture moves to provide money for future expansion. `` I'm a little disappointed in the proceeds, which should total $ 850 million,'' <PERSON> Kristiansen </PERSON> said. `` I expected it to come to about $ 1.2 billion, but it does n't change anything. Clearly, they'll be in a position to make the ... acquisitions.'' May said it does not currently have a specific use for the money from the transactions, but it is considering adding more department stores or specialty stores, repurchasing shares of its stock, or using the money for other corporate purposes. Besides <ORGANIZATION> Caldor </ORGANIZATION> and Venture, May owns 14 department store chains in 29 states and the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> and 2,663 <ORGANIZATION> Payless </ORGANIZATION> shoe stores in the Northeast.

 The man who will become <ORGANIZATION> Procter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gamble </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>'s chairman on Jan. 2 said Wednesday he expects the company to win a bigger share of international business and hopes employees increase their stake in the company `` We now think of ourselves as a world company. That's an important cultural change for P & amp; G,'' said <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Artzt </PERSON>, who also will assume the post of chief executive of the Cincinnati-based company. `` We've discovered in the past 10 years that the product strategies employed here really can work in other places around the world.'' P & amp; G says its employees, including retirees, own 24 percent of the company's stock, much of it through profit-sharing programs. <PERSON> Artzt </PERSON> said employee ownership, along with <ORGANIZATION> P </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; G's financial health and anti-takeover measures it has taken, can help guard against takeover attempts. <PERSON> Artzt </PERSON> said P & amp; G would like to see its employees' holdings grow. But, regarding concerns about takeovers, he said, `` I think the best thing a company can do is satisfy its shareholders, and we're trying to do that. <PERSON> Artzt </PERSON>, 59, who joined <ORGANIZATION> Procter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gamble </ORGANIZATION> in 1953 and has spent the past five years directing P & amp; G's international operations, said the company hopes to do half its business in overseas markets at some point during the 1990s. He told a news conference Wednesday he thinks that goal could grow further. About 39 percent of P & amp; G's sales in the last fiscal year were based outside the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. P & amp; G announced to its shareholders' meeting Tuesday that <PERSON> Artzt </PERSON> will take over Jan. 2 for <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Smale </PERSON>, who will step down as chairman and chief executive _ but continue as an employee and director _ to spend more time with his family. <PERSON> Smale </PERSON>, 62, has been with <ORGANIZATION> P </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; G since 1952. <PERSON> Artzt </PERSON> said <PERSON> Smale </PERSON> first approached him with the idea early this summer. `` I was pleasantly surprised,'' <PERSON> Artzt </PERSON> said. `` It was never my expectation that <PERSON> John </PERSON> would step aside at this point, even though some of our executives have done that. `` From my standpoint, it's quite a wonderful thing that he would step aside and give me a chance to lead this company,'' <PERSON> Artzt </PERSON> said. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pepper </PERSON>, 51, will continue as <ORGANIZATION> P </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; G's president, but will relinquish most of his responsibility for domestic operations in return for succeeding <PERSON> Artzt </PERSON> as supervisor of international operations. <PERSON> Artzt </PERSON> praised Pepper as a highly capable manager. `` I feel very good about having him in what I regard as the second most important job in the company,'' <PERSON> Artzt </PERSON> said. He suggested that Pepper could have a future shot at the chairman's job `` It's my time to step up to bat,'' <PERSON> Artzt </PERSON> said. `` <PERSON> John </PERSON>'s in a different generation than I am. He'll be around after my days are over.'' <PERSON> Artzt </PERSON> said he has no plans now to step aside early, as <PERSON> Smale </PERSON> is doing. <PERSON> Artzt </PERSON> also said he expects to make no dramatic changes in the company's direction. `` Our leader is stepping aside, but we intend to continue the program that seems to be doing so well,'' <PERSON> Artzt </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Procter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Gamble </ORGANIZATION>, a personal-care and home products company, earned a company record $ 1.6 billion on record worldwide sales of $ 21.4 billion in the fiscal year ended June 30.

 <ORGANIZATION> Motorola </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday reported higher sales and earnings for the third quarter compared to a year ago. Earnings for the three months ending Sept. 30 totaled $ 89 million, or 69 cents a share, compared with $ 87 million, or 67 cents a share, a year earlier. Sales totaled $ 2.41 billion, up 20 percent from $ 2.01 billion in the same period of 1988. Nine-month earnings totaled $ 366 million, or $ 2.82 a share, up from $ 321 million, or $ 2.48 a share, in the 1988 period. Sales for the first nine months rose to $ 6.97 billion from $ 6.06 billion last year. The 1989 figures reflect a pre-tax provision of about $ 43 million to cover anticipated costs of a voluntary severance program announced earlier this month and a decrease in the estimated 1989 full-year tax rate, <ORGANIZATION> Motorola </ORGANIZATION> said in a statement. `` We are encouraged by the continuing strong demand for our communications products, where we have had more than 40 years of uninterrupted sales growth,'' said Chairman <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Galvin </PERSON>. The company, based in this <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> suburb, also reported an increase in worldwide demand for its two-way radios, pagers and radio data systems.

 <ORGANIZATION> Toyota </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> manufacturing capacity must increase by two-thirds to meet American sales expectations, a company official said Wednesday. The boost in capacity would come at time that other automakers are struggling with too much factory capability. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> is cutting back on overtime at its plants and <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> has announced that it will close its <LOCATION> Lakewood </LOCATION> assembly plant in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> this coming March. <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> has not ruled out plant closings. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> McCurry </PERSON>, executive vice president for sales of <ORGANIZATION> Toyota </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sales </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, said he expected the company would sell 1.5 million cars and trucks a year in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> by the mid-1990s. Half of that sales volume would come from North American plants. <ORGANIZATION> Toyota </ORGANIZATION> makes cars at its plants in <LOCATION> Georgetown </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Cambridge </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ontario </LOCATION>, and at a plant in <LOCATION> Fremont </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, that it shares with <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Toyota </ORGANIZATION> plans to add light truck production to the Fremont plant by next year. The plants' current capacity for <ORGANIZATION> Toyota </ORGANIZATION> is about 450,000 vehicles a year, meaning that capacity for another 300,000 vehicles is needed. <PERSON> McCurry </PERSON>, speaking at <ORGANIZATION> Toyota </ORGANIZATION>'s media introduction of its 1990 model cars and trucks, said production at existing plants could be expanded to handle the extra 300,000, mostly through the <LOCATION> Georgetown </LOCATION> and Fremont plants. `` It's possible,'' said analyst <PERSON> Kathleen </PERSON> <PERSON> Heaney </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Nikko </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> `` They are going to do two things _ they are targeting the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> and the fleet market. They can make a big move into that area.'' A year ago, <PERSON> McCurry </PERSON> said the company was embarking on a program to expand its dealer network in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION>, an area of the country resistant to Japanese cars and trucks. On Wednesday, he said the program was working. <PERSON> McCurry </PERSON> said there are about 1,125 Toyota dealers nationwide now, and the company will have add 55 in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> by year's end. Another 55 are expected to be added in the region next year. <PERSON> McCurry </PERSON> said the company had established dealerships in most Midwest metropolitan areas and was heading out of the cities to find new dealers. Like other auto company executives, <PERSON> McCurry </PERSON> predicted a slower sales year in 1990 than in 1989, with somewhere between 14 million and 14.5 million cars and trucks being sold _ 500,000 to 1 million fewer vehicles than estimates for the 1989 calendar year. He also said that 1990 Toyota prices would be 2.1 percent on average more than 1989 prices. The increase, <PERSON> McCurry </PERSON> said, was due entirely to federally mandated passive restraint systems _ driver's side air bags or automatic seat belts
