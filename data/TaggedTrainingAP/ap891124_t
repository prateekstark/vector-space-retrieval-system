 A former East German policeman was sentenced to 14 months in prison Friday for injuring a protester detained during a pro-democracy mass demonstration last month, the state news agency <ORGANIZATION> ADN </ORGANIZATION> said. An <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> court also ordered the man, identified by ADN only as <PERSON> Horst </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON>, to pay damages to be set later. Police attending the sentencing shouted their complaints, calling out `` Corrupt!'' and `` Now you have your show trial!,'' ADN said. The policeman was found guilty of causing bodily harm when he pushed the man down stairs at a police station after taking him into custody during a demonstration Oct. 7. The ruling said the act was not deliberate, <ORGANIZATION> ADN </ORGANIZATION> said. Demonstrations in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> and other cities led to the ouster of hard-line <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Erich </PERSON> <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON>. The agency said the defendant was 41 and referred to him as a `` former policeman,'' indicating he was dismissed from the force.

<TEXT>
 The hard-line <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief and ruling <ORGANIZATION> Politburo </ORGANIZATION> resigned Friday, forced from power by a week of massive pro-democracy protests that surpassed even the `` <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> Spring'' of 1968. <PERSON> Milos </PERSON> <PERSON> Jakes </PERSON> became the third Soviet bloc leader to be swept out of office in a stunning five-week wave of political upheaval that has washed over the Communist world in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. The party <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> elected little-known <PERSON> Karel </PERSON> <PERSON> Urbanek </PERSON>, member of the party's Politburo only since October 1988, to replace <PERSON> Jakes </PERSON> who resigned along with the rest of the 13-man Politburo and Secretariat. At the end of a 16-hour closed-door session that lasted until early Saturday the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> reshuffled the Politburo, shrinking it to nine members. It elected <PERSON> Urbanek </PERSON> and five holdovers along with three new men, <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> Cizek </PERSON>, <PERSON> Miroslav </PERSON> <PERSON> Huscava </PERSON> and <PERSON> Miroslav </PERSON> <PERSON> Zajic </PERSON>. Premier <PERSON> Ladislav </PERSON> <PERSON> Adamec </PERSON>, who broke with years of policy this week by meeting opposition activists, was among those Politburo members who lost their seats, meaning a new premier will likely be named soon. Thousands of people poured into <LOCATION> Wenceslas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION> Friday night, dancing, singing and popping champagne corks at the news of the resignations. The celebration _ one week after police clubbed peaceful protesters _ capped a day in which 300,000 people jammed the square for the triumphant return of <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Dubcek </PERSON>, the bold reformer ousted in 1968. `` An old wise man said, ` If there once was light, why should there be darkness again?' Let us act in such a way to bring the light back again,'' <PERSON> Dubcek </PERSON> had told the jubilant crowd. Later, when he heard the news of the resignations, <PERSON> Dubcek </PERSON> and top dissidents at a news conference jumped to their feet, shouted `` Hooray!'' and hugged each other joyously. After the Soviet-led <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact invasion of <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> in August 1968 <PERSON> Dubcek </PERSON> was ousted from the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> in disgrace. <PERSON> Zdenek </PERSON> <PERSON> Horeni </PERSON>, editor in chief of the party newspaper Rude Pravo, held a news conference early Saturday after the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> meeting ended and he was asked about <PERSON> Dubcek </PERSON>'s future. He said <PERSON> Dubcek </PERSON> `` was expelled because he completely failed as party and state representative. I personally doubt that <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Dubcek </PERSON> could possibly be readmitted to the Czechslovak party.'' There was no immediate response to the resignations from student and intellectual leaders who had called for a general strike on Monday to force <PERSON> Jakes </PERSON> to step down. <PERSON> Urbanek </PERSON>, 48, is the former party leader of the Czech republic. He was a surprise choice to replace <PERSON> Jakes </PERSON> and represented a break with the rigid policies in place since the invasion. His selection, on a vote of 136-7, seemed designed to boost the party's flagging standing after a week of nationwide calls for its reform-resistant leaders to resign. <PERSON> Jakes </PERSON> said the party had not instituted reforms quickly enough and had underestimated the effect of the pro-democracy movement sweeping <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said it hoped <PERSON> Urbanek </PERSON> `` will act swiftly to address the long-awaited desires of the <LOCATION> Czechoslovakian </LOCATION> people for civil liberties, political freedom and basic human rights.'' British Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>, also in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, said: `` We have great hopes that <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> will also become a democracy.'' In a terse dispatch, the official news agency <ORGANIZATION> CTK </ORGANIZATION> announced: `` The general secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> Czechoslovak </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Milos </PERSON> <PERSON> Jakes </PERSON>, and all other members of the Politburo and Secretariat submitted their resignations so that a new leadership of the party could be elected. <PERSON> Jakes </PERSON> said he hoped the newly elected organs of the party will contribute to a more resolute implementation of the process of restructuring and democratization.'' Restructuring and democratization have been key terms used by Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, who has inspired the reforms that have swept through his own nation, <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>'s leaders, who were installed after the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact invasion, had resisted most of the reforms adopted by their formerly hard-line <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> allies. Earlier this year, however, they allowed thousands of East German refugees to pass through <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> on their way to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. Since Nov. 17, hundreds of thousands of people have filled the streets of <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> and other cities demanding democratic reforms and the end of the Communists' monopoly on power. They have been the largest demonstrations in the nation's history. `` For a week, our capital lives in a feverish atmosphere accompanied by large demonstrations,'' <ORGANIZATION> CTK </ORGANIZATION> quoted <PERSON> Jakes </PERSON> as saying. `` The tension is gradually spreading to other places in the republic. We must openly say that our country is at a fateful crossroads.'' `` We have underestimated completely the processes taking place in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> and especially recently in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and their effect and influence on our society,'' said <PERSON> Jakes </PERSON>, who was responsible for the expulsion from the party of half a million Communists, including <PERSON> Dubcek </PERSON>. In December 1987, <PERSON> Jakes </PERSON> was named <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief to succeed <PERSON> Gustav </PERSON> <PERSON> Husak </PERSON>, who came to power in April 1969, eight months after the invasion. <PERSON> Jakes </PERSON>, 67, was seen as a bureaucrat and party functionary whose speeches and personality have made little or no public impact despite his long years in high office. <PERSON> Dubcek </PERSON>, 67, made his first public appearance in <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> since the party purge in June 1970. Since his ouster, he has worked as a low-level employee of the state forestry services and has lived in virtual seclusion. `` Dubcek, <PERSON> Dubcek </PERSON>!'' and `` Long live <PERSON> Dubcek </PERSON>!'' the flag-waving crowd yelled as he appeared in <LOCATION> Wenceslas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION>, the site of repeated pro-democracy demonstrations. He urged them to unite to improve the country. `` The ideal of socialism with a human face is living in the conditions of a new generation,'' <PERSON> Dubcek </PERSON> said. `` We must unify to raise our country to a higher level.'' Pro-democracy demonstrations also were held in the cities of <LOCATION> Bratislava </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Brno </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kosice </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ostrava </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Usti </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> nad </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labem </ORGANIZATION>, according to state-run media. <PERSON> Dubcek </PERSON> threw his support behind the Civil Forum, an opposition group formed Sunday to guide <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>'s pro-democracy movement. He appealed to police, militia and the army `` to stand by the people's side,'' and not to destroy the search for democracy. `` Do not act against the people. Remember, you are from the people,'' <PERSON> Dubcek </PERSON> said. He also told demonstrators to `` avoid extremist trends.'' Riot police beat hundreds of peaceful demonstrators in the square on Nov. 17, sparking a week of growing protests. Police have kept a generally low profile since then. Playwright <PERSON> Vaclav </PERSON> <PERSON> Havel </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>'s most prominent dissident, then spoke to the crowd and told them that Civic Forum `` is ready to negotiate with the authorities elsewhere than on the streets.'' `` But it's not up to us, but to them, whether democracy will arise from the excited atmosphere on the square. It is their turn to move, not ours,'' <PERSON> Havel </PERSON> said.

 A growing drug trade has led to concern that the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> is in danger of becoming the <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> of the <LOCATION> Far </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>. Calls are going out for tougher laws and the death penalty for drug dealers. Police say the illegal drug trade has become a $ 41 million-a-year business in recent years. The three largest drug syndicates employ about 15,000 people fulltime, according to police estimates. The trade comes nowhere near that of <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s multibillion-dollar drug cartels, but experts here say most of the narcotics produced in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> are used locally But Filipino and foreign experts fear the country could become a major regional drug center because of a favorable climate for growing marijuana, corruption and inefficiency within the police and established trade and communications links to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and other markets. In October, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> agents in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> seized two tons of Philippine-grown marijuana worth $ 14 million in what was believed to be an attempt to establish a pipeline between <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. Two Americans of Filipino ancestry were arrested recently in <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION> for allegedly trying to smuggle in two pounds of the drug crystal methamphetamine, a widely abused drug known in <LOCATION> Southeast </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> as `` shabu'' and said by officials and drug experts to be more addictive than crack. Philippine-grown marijuana and other drugs also have turned up, albeit in modest amounts, in <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> and some <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> countries, police say. Foreign and Filipino narcotics officials say syndicates have been bringing in foreigners, mostly Europeans, to teach growers here how to grow better quality marijuana. Last year, police uprooted 15 million marijuana plants and seized 7.5 tons of marijuana packed for shipment abroad. `` If we do not do something about this, there might come a time when we will see the spectacle of the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> becoming like <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>, where drug lords even have armies, helicopters, planes and even tanks,'' Sen. <PERSON> Alberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Romulo </PERSON> said at a recent Philippine <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> hearing. Public concern over the problem began to grow in October after Sen. <PERSON> Ernesto </PERSON> <PERSON> Herrera </PERSON> charged that at least 17 police and military members, including a brigadier general, were protecting drug lords. According to the police, the drug trade is flourishing because of the potential for huge profits in a country where the annual per capita income is only about $ 600. Marijuana can be bought in remote mountain plantations for 200 pesos -LRB- $ 9 -RRB- a kilo -LRB- 2.2 pounds -RRB- and sold in <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> for 10 times as much. <PERSON> Shabu </PERSON>, the crystaline drug, can be purchased in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> for about $ 2,270 a kilo and sold in <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> for the equivalent of $ 45,450. Sources say some shabu also is being made locally. Corruption among police and customs officials is said to compound the enforcement problem. Col. <PERSON> Virgilio </PERSON> <PERSON> David </PERSON>, chief of the national police <ORGANIZATION> Narcotics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION>, said his unit is riddled with corruption because poorly paid policemen find it difficult to turn down bribes from drug syndicates. He said at least 40 of his officers and men had been removed in an attempt to combat corruption. <PERSON> David </PERSON> and others say stronger laws and greater police powers are needed in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>. `` In <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, if you go there and the police doubt your papers, they can just detain you,'' <PERSON> David </PERSON> said. `` That is the same case in <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION>. They have stronger laws that empower the police to arrest anybody based only on strong suspicion that they are a violators of the law. We must have the same kind of laws here.'' <PERSON> David </PERSON> said the military has urged <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to revive the death penalty for drug dealers. The Constitution, ratified in 1987, abolished capital punishment but allows <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to revive it for `` heinous'' crimes. He also said the government should establish special courts to handle only drug offenses to speed up trials, which often drag on here for years. Because of legal obstacles in enforcing the laws, critics say, police often simply execute big-time dealers and then report that they were killed in a `` shootout.'' In the <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> area alone, at least 22 drug pushers have been killed in `` shootouts'' with police since <PERSON> Herrera </PERSON> made his charges about the police and military in October. Sen. <PERSON> Neptali </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON>, a former justice secretary, said the killings should persuade drug dealers to turn themselves in and seek government protection. `` Otherwise, they may soon find themselves targets of elimination,'' he said.

 <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> is trying to stuff a bigger air conditioner into its cars, while <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telegraph </ORGANIZATION> is revising decades-old assembly line practices. The changes come as industry, under pressure from government and environmentalists, seeks to eliminate the use of chlorofluorocarbons, the one-time wonder chemical that has been destroying the Earth's ozone layer. But the task is more complicated than simply replacing an old chemical with a new one, government and industry experts say. `` The transition is going to take time ... We're talking about retrofitting not one industry, but several industries,'' says F.A. `` Tony'' <PERSON> Vogelsberg </PERSON>, environmental manager for the Freon Division at <ORGANIZATION> Du </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pont </ORGANIZATION>, a major producers of CFCs. CFCs, discovered in 1928, help cool houses in the summer and keep them warm in the winter. They are used to make the foam cushions on couches, in pillows _ even in stuffed toys. Without them, refrigerators would not cool as well; radios, televisions, stereos or home computers might not work as well, and items from coaxial cables to mailed Christmas gifts might not have as much packaging protection. But CFCs also have a dark side: When they float 10 to 30 miles above the <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> to the stratosphere, their chlorine component eats away at the ozone shield that protects against the sun's cancer-causing ultraviolet rays Industrial nations want to ban all CFC production within the next decade. But while a half-dozen or more replacements are under study, they all have some drawbacks and no single substitute is expected to be found. `` I do n't think there's going to be a substitute that is going to be given an A-plus on all -LRB- areas of concern -RRB-,'' said <PERSON> Eileen </PERSON> <PERSON> Claussen </PERSON>, director of atmospheric and indoor air programs at the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>. `` We're going to have to make some tradeoffs.'' The <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> is examining the array of substitutes, mainly a family of chemicals called HCFCs, to determine whether they are toxic or pose other health concerns and how significantly they harm the environment. The HCFCs also deplete ozone but much less severely. `` We clearly do not want to blunder along and create a new health or environmental problem while solving the ones that we targeted,'' said <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Elkins </PERSON>, whose EPA office is reviewing the potential toxicity of some <ORGANIZATION> CFC </ORGANIZATION> substitutes. Every year more than 2 billion pounds of CFCs are produced worldwide, a third of them in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> banned use of the chemical in aerosol cans in 1978, four years after the first concerns about the ozone layer were raised. Still, the operation of more than $ 135 billion worth of equipment nationwide is dependent on CFCs. Industry turned to CFCs because they do not burn or corrode metal, pose no direct health hazards to workers and hold heat and cold, making them ideal insulators. That was before their threat to the ozone layer was understood. Half of the ozone over <LOCATION> Antarctica </LOCATION> was destroyed during September and October 1987, causing a hole in the Earth's protective shield that closes and reappears with the seasons. Severe destruction of the ozone layer is believed to be occurring over the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pole </LOCATION> again this year, according to scientists. They say the conditions for ozone destruction are present over the <LOCATION> Arctic </LOCATION>, although no massive loss of ozone has been observed there. Several large corporations have announced plans to end their reliance on CFCs, some by the early 1990s. These include such giants as <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T, <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION>. `` We have used <ORGANIZATION> CFC </ORGANIZATION> solvents and cleaners for so long they're almost ingrained in the manufacturing process,'' says <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Chittick </PERSON>, vice president for environment and safety at AT & amp; T. Nevertheless, <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T hopes to end all uses of CFCs by 1994 The major automakers are developing substitutes and are designing new air conditioning units to accommodate the changeover, probably in the mid-1990s. But the new air conditioners will be less energy efficient and require larger compressors, experts say. `` We feel we can do it without any dramatic effects on the look or design of the car. It's going to be difficult though,'' says <PERSON> Toni </PERSON> <PERSON> Simonetti </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> is considering legislation calling for the elimination of CFCs by the year 2000 and at least 20 states are reviewing proposals aimed at curbing <ORGANIZATION> CFC </ORGANIZATION> pollution. <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION> has banned the use of CFCs in auto air conditioners after 1994. <PERSON> Du </PERSON> <PERSON> Pont </PERSON> has spent more than $ 100 million on research for <ORGANIZATION> CFC </ORGANIZATION> substitutes and estimates it will spend as much as $ 1 billion to build production plants and to cover other costs during a 10-year transition period. <ORGANIZATION> ICI </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Americas </ORGANIZATION>, another major manufacturer, also has spent $ 100 million in <ORGANIZATION> CFC </ORGANIZATION> replacement research and recently announced plans to begin production of a substitute cooling agent by 1992 at a new <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> plant. But developing substitute chemicals will not be enough. As much as 30 percent of today's <ORGANIZATION> CFC </ORGANIZATION> demand will have to be eliminated by conservation and recycling, government and industry experts say. Major appliance manufacturers as well as automakers recently have supplied their repair shops with equipment to capture CFCs rather than let the old coolant vent into the air. But EPA and industry officials acknowledge that routine venting of old CFCs is still widespread. Shifts to new manufacturing procedures or altogether new technology could account for a 30 percent reduction in <ORGANIZATION> CFC </ORGANIZATION> demand, especially in the electronics industry, the experts say. But some critics say that industry is slow to accept new technology. `` What we're facing is inertia,'' says <PERSON> Marc </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldberg </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Crynodynamics </LOCATION>, a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey-based </LOCATION> company that is producing a refrigeration system using helium as a cooling agent. The system is being marketed primarily for commercial uses. The major automakers have expressed little interest. Companies such as <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T and <ORGANIZATION> Northern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telecom </ORGANIZATION> are turning to new manufacturing procedures such as using low-solid fluxes to reduce leftover residues and eliminate the need for CFCs as a solvent for cleaning circuit boards after soldering. `` This -LRB- CFC problem -RRB- has caused a whole new review of the way we do business,'' says <PERSON> A.D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzgerald </PERSON>, director of environmental affairs at <ORGANIZATION> Northern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telecom </ORGANIZATION>, a Canadian-based manufacturer of telephone equipment. The thorniest problems have emerged in the area of refrigeration and air conditioning because all substitutes under consideration pose energy and environmental tradeoffs, particularly in the area of global warming. A bill putting a time limit on use of HCFCs as substitutes for chlorofluorocarbons has been approved by a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> environmental subcommittee, but its prospects in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> are uncertain. Environmentalists say, meanwhile, that even the less potent HCFCs would be a dangerous threat to ozone depletion if the amount used worldwide is dramatically increased over the next century. The <ORGANIZATION> HCFC </ORGANIZATION> family of substitutes should be looked at only as a `` bridge'' solution and industry should not be allowed to `` sit back and be happy once they made the one-step transition,'' says <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Doniger </PERSON>, an attorney for the <ORGANIZATION> Natural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>.

<TEXT>
 Arriving at work one recent morning, <PERSON> Adolfo </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> Esquivel </PERSON>, winner of the 1980 Nobel Peace Prize, found his office had been vandalized. An interior door was smashed open, and thieves took a computer, files and typewriters from his workplace in a dilapidated building in a run-down neighborhood. `` They were n't common criminals, but ... the forces of national insecurity,'' the human rights advocate said in an interview. `` They stole everything and the police did absolutely nothing.'' <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> Esquivel </PERSON>, 59, recounted the incident matter-of-factly, convinced the break-in stemmed from his vocal opposition to an Oct. 7 presidential pardon of soldiers accused of human rights abuses, and his efforts to call attention to society's downtrodden. `` The Nobel Prize opened a lot of doors and possibilities, except in my own country, where ... an effort continues to permanently silence our work,'' he said. The mild mannered, slightly built son of a Spanish fisherman taught architecture at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Plata </ORGANIZATION> until he became enmeshed in human rights causes during <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>'s turbulent 1970s. While leftists with guns and bombs tried to bring down the elected government of President <PERSON> Isabel </PERSON> <PERSON> Peron </PERSON> and the military regime that succeeded it, <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> Esquivel </PERSON> preached social change through non-violence. In 1973, he founded the <ORGANIZATION> Peace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, which has branches in 11 Latin American countries. Two years later, he helped set up the <ORGANIZATION> Permanent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION>. Both organizations protested the arrests and presumed killings of thousands of alleged leftists who `` disappeared'' during the 1976-83 dictatorship. Despite the work of his organizations and his detention without charges for 15 months in 1977 and 1978, <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> Esquivel </PERSON> was little known even in <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> when the Nobel Committee announced his name in October 1980. Since then, <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> Esquivel </PERSON> has achieved a certain international stature, although nothing like that of other Nobel laureates such as <PERSON> Mother </PERSON> <PERSON> Teresa </PERSON>, <PERSON> Andrei </PERSON> <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON>, <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> or Archbishop <PERSON> Desmond </PERSON> <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON>. These days, <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> Esquivel </PERSON> puts together proposals to raise funds from churches and agencies in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, travels and writes. He and a small staff, mostly volunteers, help poor people get legal title to land on which they work or live, set up shelters for abandoned children, organize soup kitchens and clothing drives for the needy. Most any rally in support of democracy, civil rights or social welfare can count on his presence, his signature on petitions, his voice. `` He genuinely feels his ideals,'' said the director of the human rights group <ORGANIZATION> Legal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studies </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Emilio </PERSON> <PERSON> Mignone </PERSON>, a friend for 15 years. `` He is a very simple man ... ethical, generous.'' <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> Esquivel </PERSON> also can be disorganized and quixotic, however, and that, colleagues say, has hampered his effectiveness. His Peace and <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> is neither the biggest nor most prestigious human rights group in <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>. Leaders of other groups _ who also protested, at personal risk, the atrocities of the `` dirty war'' against leftist subversion _ hoped <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> Esquivel </PERSON>'s distinction would make it easier to influence popular opinion and public policy. That has not happened. The government treats <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> Esquivel </PERSON> as a gadfly, and his Peace and <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> lacks the staff and the clout to deliver people to rallies or push an idea in the public consciousness. `` He's more important internationally'' than in <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Hebe </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Bonafini </PERSON>, a founder another human rights group, the Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo. `` I think he could have done more things. ... Before, he had more impact than now.'' <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> Esquivel </PERSON>'s politics are openly left of center. Companies and natural resources should be kept in state hands even if they lose money or the government has no ability to exploit them, he says, criticizing plans to privatize them. The foreign debt is unpayable, he says, workers should receive higher salaries, businesses should be compelled to be more productive, the government should insist that capital flight cease, weapons manufacturers should be convinced to make non-lethal products. And the servicemen who committed human rights abuses should be tried by elected President <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Menem </PERSON>'s government, he says, despite open resistence from sectors of the armed forces. Despite the seriousness of his causes, his maintains a cheerful disposition and says he bears no hatred to those who imprisoned him or threatened him, his wife or his three children. `` I'm optimistic by nature,'' he said. `` I try to contribute, to make things a little better. ... I hope my life has been useful.''

<HEAD>Table Manners 101: Remove the Tables</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BIRMINGHAM, Ala. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 An assistant principal who got fed up with his students' sloppy habits tried to teach them a lesson in table manners by taking away the cafeteria tables. Teens in two of the three lunch periods at <ORGANIZATION> Erwin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> ate on the floor Wednesday after Assistant Principal <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> ordered the tables taken down. `` What we did today we did to get their attention,'' <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> said. `` I hope we got it.'' <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> said school administrators had warned students for two weeks to clean up after themselves or risk losing their tables. `` The problem has been that we've had some pigs eating in the cafeteria _ at least you might call them that from the look of the place after they finish,'' <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> said. But some students and their parents found the tactic severe. `` The floor is something people walk on, not eat on. It's nasty,'' said <PERSON> Mandy </PERSON> <PERSON> DeWitt </PERSON>, a junior who left school rather than dine on the linoleum `` They are punishing all of us for the actions of a few and that's not right.'' Her mother, <PERSON> Brenda </PERSON> <PERSON> DeWitt </PERSON>, said <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> punished a `` lot of kids who did nothing wrong and I think, they forgot they were dealing with children, not prisoners in a war camp.'' <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> responded: `` The students were not kept from eating. What we were trying to teach them is that there are consequences for their actions.'' <PERSON> Tracey </PERSON> <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON>, another junior who left school at lunchtime, said the action was ill-timed as well as unfair, because she and other students had donated blood that day.

<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> is conducting one of the largest aid programs in its history to support the government in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>, transporting billions of dollars in weapons, food and fuel to the war-torn nation. Beginning at least one year before the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> withdrew in February 1989, the operation has brought hundreds of thousands of tons of commodities to <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, the state-run press has reported. Another $ 3 billion in military aid, including advanced weapons, is supplied annually, Eastern European diplomats said. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> gives the anti-government guerrillas an estimated $ 500 million worth of arms a year. `` If we did n't have food from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, we would starve,'' says <PERSON> Massuma </PERSON> <PERSON> Esmaty </PERSON> <PERSON> Wardak </PERSON>, president of the <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> Women's Council. `` We have no one else to turn to.'' The massive operation indicates the commitment <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> has made to the <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> government, which came to power in a bloody Communist coup in 1978. Soviet troops arrived the following year to prop up the faltering Marxist regime. After the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> ended its decade-long military intervention in February, Western diplomats predicted a quick victory for the guerrillas. But <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> did n't fall. The rebels failed to unite, and Soviet aid gave the government the firepower and food it needed. `` The West underestimated the Soviet commitment. Everyone thought the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> was retreating and had lost the war,'' said one diplomat, who has been counting transport planes and trucks for the past nine months. `` Only now do we know how serious the Russians really were.'' For their aid, the Soviets get a pliant government on its southern border that helps offset neighboring <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s Islamic fundamentalism and <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>'s pro-Americanism. In late October, the Daily <PERSON> Payam </PERSON>, official organ of the ruling <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Afghanistan </ORGANIZATION>, published an unusually detailed account of Soviet aid. From February to August, it said, 266,543 metric tons of Soviet goods crossed through the border town of <LOCATION> Hayratan </LOCATION>. Among the goods, more than 40,000 tons of fuel, 82,000 tons of wheat, 1,000 tons of cooking oil, 900 tons of sugar and 540 tons of flour rolled into <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> on more than 21,000 Soviet trucks, the newspaper said. The <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> says another 220,000 tons of Soviet-supplied flour, some of it purchased from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>, is in the pipeline. Also since February, 168,750 tons of goods have arrived in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> aboard 6,750 Soviet transport planes, diplomats said. Diplomats estimated that until recently the airlift contained 75 percent weapons and 25 percent food. But Afghan officials reportedly have asked that the food portion be raised to 40 percent in view of the coming winter and the country's serious transportation problems, caused by war, bad roads and harsh weather. To help with this problem, the Soviets recently gave <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> 2,200 heavy duty trucks, the state-run <ORGANIZATION> Bakhtar </ORGANIZATION> news agency reported last month. Tens of thousands of vehicles had already been left behind by the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> when it pulled out. Diplomats said the duration and size of the operation make it one of the biggest aid programs in Soviet history, rivaled only by Soviet aid to <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>. `` The costs are tremendous and we believe that not even <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> knows how much it is paying,'' said one high-ranking <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> diplomat whose country is friendly with both <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>. In the military sphere, diplomats in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Islamabad </LOCATION> say that since 1988, about $ 200 million to $ 300 million in weapons have been crossing the Soviet border each month. Diplomats from two Eastern European countries who provided the $ 3 billion annual estimate said <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> has promised to provide <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> with two advanced weapons: the Scud-500, an updated version of the medium-range missiles already supplied to <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>, and the MiG-29, an advanced combat jet. The Soviets already have given <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> more than 150 planes for its air force, mostly MiG-21 fighters. <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> also has received air defense rockets, according to the April 29 edition of the state-run <ORGANIZATION> Kabul </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>, which carried a photograph of the weapons on its front page. Some diplomats challenged attempts to estimate the value of Soviet military aid because accounting methods vary from country to country. Diplomats in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> say <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> has fired 1,000 Scud missiles in the past year at the rebels. Each rocket costs about $ 1 million on the arms market, bringing the Scuds' total cost to $ 1 billion. But they contend the missiles are valueless because <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> probably would have destroyed the weapons, which were orginally built to carry nuclear warheads and use 1960s technology. In addition to aid, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> occupies a commanding position in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s economy. Soviet economic ties account for 60 percent of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s state budget and 75 percent of its industrial output, the Daily <PERSON> Payam </PERSON> said in November Soviet assistance is used in the production of 100 percent of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s natural gas, 100 percent of its chemical fertilizer and 60 percent of its electricity, the <PERSON> Payam </PERSON> said. Since the 1954 signing of the first Afghan-Soviet long term credit agreement, <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> has had close economic ties with <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>. Soviet aid built housing, roads and bridges, and generated power. In 1956, the two nations signed an agreement for the training and modernization of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s armed forces. The military led the Communist revolution in 1978. Since the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> intervention, <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> has become increasingly isolated economically. The U.S.-backed rebels have cut the road to <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, which carried flour and cooking oil. Trade with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> is minimal. Among the industrialized nations only <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, which exports about $ 100 million a year, has substantial economic ties.

 `` I am numb from all those years of waiting, waiting in vain,'' says Cardinal <PERSON> Myroslav </PERSON> <PERSON> Lubachivsky </PERSON>. But the wait is nearly over. Few perhaps have more riding on Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON>'s meeting Dec. 1 with Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> than <PERSON> Lubachivsky </PERSON>, head of the Ukrainian <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>. The historic encounter holds out the prospect that the Ukrainian church will be legalized after 43 years of suppression, and <PERSON> Lubachivsky </PERSON> will be able to return to his homeland for the first time in 51 years. `` We're optimistic about it, yes,'' the 75-year-old former metropolitan-archbishop of <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> said in an interview. `` But to have too much hope, too much trust is not good. There is a Polish proverb: ` Hope is mother of the stupid people.' So it's better just to be practical and wait to see what happens. Still, <PERSON> Lubachivsky </PERSON> sees concrete signs the pope's talks with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> will pave the way for legalization of the Ukrainian church in the next two months. He said information coming from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> indicates the government has already approved the basis of a new law on religion, which would give all churches the same legal status under the Constitution. `` We expect this will become law around the middle or end of January,'' <PERSON> Lubachivsky </PERSON> said. He says Soviet authorities have adopted a much more tolerant attitude toward the Ukrainian Catholics in the past few months, allowing them to celebrate Mass in public, import Bibles and communicate by fax with church groups in the West. It is in <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s interests to legalize the church of more than 4 million followers in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s second largest republic, the cardinal said. `` If Mr. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> would like to have the moral support of the Holy Father, this is the condition that he could get it,'' <PERSON> Lubachivsky </PERSON> said. `` He needs this. He'll also have the support from the Western countries. He needs the money from the West.'' Legalizing the Ukrainian church could also lead to the first papal visit to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> frequently has expressed the wish to travel to the <LOCATION> Ukraine </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION>. `` We would invite him as soon as we are free,'' <PERSON> Lubachivsky </PERSON> said. `` I think he would not refuse.'' <PERSON> Lubachivsky </PERSON> credits the Polish-born <PERSON> pope </PERSON>, a fellow Slav, for helping bring the Ukrainian church out of the catacombs and to the brink of legalization. `` He is the greatest friend of ours and he has always assured me he would be staying fast for the legalization of our church,'' he said. Ukrainian Catholics practice the Byzantine, or Eastern, rite but look to <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> for guidance and recognize the authority of the pope. The Ukrainian church, which traces its history to the introduction of Christianity in the region 1,000 years ago, was suppressed in 1946 by Soviet dictator <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>. It was forcibly merged with the Russian Orthodox Church and its clergy were arrested, deported or shot. The church continued to flourish underground, however, with priests and bishops ordained and consecrated in secret. Encouraged by <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s glasnost policies, church officials and faithful have come out in the open in the past two years to demand official recognition. Church officials in the West estimate there are 12 <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> bishops, 1,000 priests and 1,200 monks and nuns in the <LOCATION> Ukraine </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Lubachivsky </PERSON> was born in <LOCATION> Dolyna </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ukraine </LOCATION>, in 1914. He left in 1937 when the <LOCATION> Ukraine </LOCATION> was under Polish occupation to study in <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>. He moved to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in 1947 and became an <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> citizen. The pope appointed <PERSON> Lubachivsky </PERSON> as metropolitan-archbishop of <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> in 1979 and made him cardinal six years later. He replaced Cardinal <PERSON> Josyf </PERSON> <PERSON> Slipyj </PERSON>, who died in 1984, as leader of Ukrainian Catholics. If the church is legalized, <PERSON> Lubachivsky </PERSON> said, he would return to the <LOCATION> Ukraine </LOCATION> if permitted by Soviet authorities and organize the hierarchy. `` I would like to see how the country looks because for 50 years I have n't seen anything,'' he said. `` I would like to see for myself how the people are living. Most of my family has died, but I would like to see if there are any relatives left.'' A major stumbling block to legalization has been the opposition of the Russian Orthodox Church, which stands to lose some 450 churches it took over from the Catholics after 1946. `` Up until now the people were worshiping in forests, in the streets, in private houses,'' <PERSON> Lubachivsky </PERSON> said. `` That's not the way to worship God.'' <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> officials have held periodic negotiations with the Russian Orthodox Church, but <PERSON> Lubachivsky </PERSON> contends only the Soviet government can resolve the dispute by giving the churches back.

 The assassination of President <PERSON> Rene </PERSON> <PERSON> Mouawad </PERSON> leaves <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> staring into the abyss, as it has so often since a seemingly endless civil war began 14 years ago. <PERSON> Mouawad </PERSON> was trying to assemble a government that could end the war. His death Wednesday, after only 17 days as president, raised the possibility of more fighting between the 40,000 Syrian soldiers in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> and Gen. <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>, the Christian army commander. The assassination underlined the dangers of trying to achieve peace in a deeply divided land that has become a proxy battleground for rival powers in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>. One clear motive for killing <PERSON> Mouawad </PERSON> was to undermine the peace agreement reached by <LOCATION> Lebanese </LOCATION> legislators Oct. 24 in <LOCATION> Taif </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>, after weeks of negotiations mediated by the <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION>. Many earlier attempts to end the war, which has cost more than 150,000 lives since 1975, have been wrecked by one or more of the many factions involved. <PERSON> Amin </PERSON> <PERSON> Gemayel </PERSON>, who was <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s last president and left office last fall, scuttled a Syrian-arranged peace treaty signed in December 1985 by leaders of the main Moslem and Christian militias. He contended it stripped Maronite Catholics of the power they have held since independence from <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> in 1943. <PERSON> Mouawad </PERSON> also was a Maronite, the main Christian sect in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, as <LOCATION> Lebanese </LOCATION> presidents traditionally have been. If supporters of the Taif accord hope to save it, they must move swiftly to elect another president acceptable both to <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>, the main power broker in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, and the Moslem and Christian factions. More than a score of people were killed with <PERSON> Mouawad </PERSON>, an advocate of reconciliation, when a remote-controlled bomb containing an estimated 550 pounds of explosives went off in a crowded street as his motorcade passed. There was no claim of responsibility, but the murky world of Lebanese and <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> politics contains no shortage of suspects. <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>, which supports the Taif accord, quickly pointed the finger at <LOCATION> Aoun </LOCATION>, the main Christian opponent of the plan. President <PERSON> Hafez </PERSON> <PERSON> Assad </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> clearly referred to the general when he called the assassination `` a new impulse to double the support for <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> so that it can destroy the evil in its nest and in order for the Lebanese to avenge themselves against those ... who wanted with their crime to hit <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s unity and prolong the suffering of the Lebanese.'' <PERSON> Assad </PERSON> did not elaborate, but his remarks indicated <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> might use the slaying to justify a move against <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s chief of staff, Lt. Gen. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Shomron </PERSON>, said in <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION> the Syrians probably would attack <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>, who commands about 20,000 men in Christian units of the Lebanese army. <PERSON> Yossi </PERSON> <PERSON> Olmert </PERSON>, an Israeli government official, said: `` The losers are the Syrians, and those who gained are all those who think that an elected president in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> would be bad for their interests.'' An Arab analyst said privately the gainers include <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. `` A unified Lebanese government would be able to ask the Syrians to leave, which the Syrians do n't want to do,'' he said. `` If the Syrians went, then the Israelis would have to get out of the border enclave they occupy in south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> has said the Taif agreement is a betrayal because it does not provide for speedy withdrawal of the 40,000 Syrian soldiers, who are in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> under an <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> peacekeeping mandate issued in 1976. He fought an artillery `` war of liberation'' against the <ORGANIZATION> Syrians </ORGANIZATION> that lasted six months until the <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> arranged a truce Sept. 22. More than 900 people were killed and nearly 3,000 wounded, most of them civilians. The fundamentalist Shiite Moslem militia <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>, and its Iranian sponsors, also oppose the peace accord. <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> says it ignores the demands of the 1.2 million Shiites, the largest sect in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, for more political power. Druse Moslem chief <PERSON> Walid </PERSON> <PERSON> Jumblatt </PERSON> has gone along with the agreement, albeit grudgingly, to please his <LOCATION> Syrian </LOCATION> allies, but has made clear he does not feel it goes far enough in curbing Maronite privilege. Some Lebanese see the hand of <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>'s archrival in the Arab world and <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s main supporter, in the assassination of <LOCATION> Mouawad </LOCATION>. President <PERSON> Saddam </PERSON> <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, a sworn enemy of <PERSON> Assad </PERSON>, went along with the Taif accord only after <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> threatened to cut off aid.

 <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s judicial set-up may appear similar to systems in the West, but in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> strip searches are routine, lengthy delays occur in setting bail, and the odds of being found innocent are 1-in-15 ,000, an expert says `` There are many peculiar traditions,'' said <PERSON> Hiroshi </PERSON> <PERSON> Itakura </PERSON>, professor of criminal law at <ORGANIZATION> Nippon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. The traditions and customs, which play a strong role at all levels of Japanese society, may pose other hurdles for the 12 politicians, bureaucrats or business executives charged with bribery in the influence-peddling scandal known as the Recruit affair. The first of five separate trials begins Friday. `` The Japanese judiciary system may look similar to that of ordinary Western democratic countries on the surface, but it differs a great deal in substance,'' <PERSON> Itakura </PERSON> said. In a typical criminal case, suspects are required to undergo a physical examination completely naked at the beginning of police investigation following arrest. Police can question suspects for up to 48 hours before sending them to prosecutors, who have 20 days to interrogate them before filing formal charges with the court. The suspect is permitted to have a lawyer present during interrogation. An arrested person has no chance of being released on bail until prosecutors complete their investigation. <PERSON> Hiromasa </PERSON> <PERSON> Ezoe </PERSON>, the central figure in the Recruit bribery case, was arrested Feb. 13 and held until June 6, when he was released on $ 1.4 million bail. He was charged with seven counts of bribery of politicians and public officials. Defendants do not enter a formal plea until their trials start, and there is no plea bargaining beforehand. There is no chance to sway a jury _ trials are decided by a single judge at the district court level _ and judges hardly ever give innocent verdicts. `` The chance that the court will find a suspect innocent is only one out of 15,000,'' said <PERSON> Itakura </PERSON>. `` I think it reflects a homogeneous society where judges, prosecutors and defense attorneys all share a similar sense of justice and fairness.'' If <PERSON> Ezoe </PERSON>'s trial goes by the usual pattern in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, his 18 defense lawyers will try to draw the case out and reduce the penalty after the virtually inevitable guilty verdict. Since there is no plea bargaining, a defendant may want to plead innocent, but a judge may take that as a sign of a lack of repentance and impose a stiffer sentence. `` Once you are arrested for wrongdoing, it is hard to expect fairness of the Western standard in this country,'' said <PERSON> Itakura </PERSON>. `` I guess it depends on how you define fairness, but in general, the Japanese judiciary system is made in such a way that tends to be quite cruel to criminals.''

 A retiree who borrowed $ 20 from his ex-wife to play a slot machine in the city's newest resort won a $ 4.6 million jackpot. <PERSON> Elmer </PERSON> <PERSON> Sherwin </PERSON>, 76, of <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION>, hedged when a reporter asked him during a Thanksgiving Day news conference if his newfound fortune would reunite the couple. `` She wo n't have me,'' <PERSON> Sherwin </PERSON> said. `` He said that, not me,'' piped up his ex-wife, <LOCATION> Florence </LOCATION>, who said the two are `` still buddies'' 13 years after divorce ended their 25-year marriage. <PERSON> Sherwin </PERSON> spent 90 minutes playing $ 80 of his own money Wednesday night at the new Mirage hotel-casino on the <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION> strip. Then, nine hours after the casino opened and shortly after borrowing the money, he hit the winner.

<TEXT>
 For former Secretary of State <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON>, the reunification of West and <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> will be a reality when the long-divided German nation fields a single Olympic athletic team. Former Secretary of State <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kissinger </PERSON> thinks reunification will come much sooner, perhaps within five years. Former Secretary of State Dean <PERSON> Rusk </PERSON>, who marvels at the changes being wrought in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, believes it is far too early to even discuss reunification and that doing so before events sort themselves out is `` folly.'' All three men had long experience sitting across the table from tough Soviet leaders in grimmer times when the Cold War was truly cold and the Iron Curtain truly iron. All three have varying ideas about the events transforming <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> now. <PERSON> Rusk </PERSON>, who was secretary of state in the <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> administration when the <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Wall </LOCATION> was built, said in an interview that any discussion of reunification is decidedly premature. `` I never thought I would live to see the day these things would happen in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Rusk </PERSON> said, speaking of the reform program of Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, the rise of democratic movements in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, the opening of the <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> Wall, and unprecedented protest demonstrations in <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION>. `` These are dramatic and important changes,'' <PERSON> Rusk </PERSON> said. `` It's too soon to tell if they are permanent But I'm inclined to think <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and the other leaders have set in motion forces that are irresistible.'' <PERSON> Rusk </PERSON> noted that 20 Soviet divisions remain in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> with others in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. `` If <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> were to be replaced we could return to the Cold War rather quickly,'' <PERSON> Rusk </PERSON> said. In light of the uncertainties, he said, `` I deplore the premature discussion of German reunification. In a situation moving so fast, it's folly to do that.'' <PERSON> Kissinger </PERSON> believes German reunification is `` unavoidable.'' `` I do n't believe that unification is decades away,'' <PERSON> Kissinger </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> on Sunday. `` I really believe it will happen within the next decade, and maybe even within the next five years.'' But <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON> disagrees, saying, `` whatever develops will develop more slowly than people think.'' `` I'd like to make a wager on when <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> will have just one team in the Olympic Games,'' he said in an interview, noting the rivalry that has existed between the two Germanys in the past. During the 40 years in which the two Germanys have existed side by side, united by a common tongue and culture, divided by ideology and walls, `` a lot of nationalism has developed,'' <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON> said. The East Germans, he said, are relatively well and inexpensively housed, and have a reasonable chance at a good education. `` I think there will be cooperative ventures between East and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON> said. `` But as to reunification, I'd be surprised if there was a single German team before two -LRB- four-year -RRB- Olympic cycles are gone through. That would be an indication that reunification had been completed.'' <PERSON> Rusk </PERSON> and <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON> reject complaints by congressional Democrats that when it comes to exploiting the opportunities presented by the rush of events in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is `` overly timid.'' `` My view is that we are doing the right thing,'' <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON> said, `` Because events and developments are changing so rapidly it makes no sense to announce a hard and firm policy until we see the results and know where things are going. `` I think it's unwise for the government to make strong statements of policy now,'' he said. `` Being very aggressive in foreign policy is often just a formula for spending more money.'' <PERSON> Rusk </PERSON> appeared to agree with that. `` I'm inclined to think this is a pretty good time for the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to remain silent,'' he said. `` I realize they find that difficult. But they also find it difficult to be subtle and sophisticated and tend to see things in black and white.'' <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON> was asked if he had any advice for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> as his December summit with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> approaches. `` Keep on doing what he's doing,'' <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON> replied. `` I think he's doing great.''

The birds troop through her yard, pausing to peck at grain she throws to them. But they're still wild turkeys.

<TEXT>
 The Pentagon says <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> is considering a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> proposal to aid the anti-drug war by posting a flotilla off <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s coast. The proposal is among a range of ideas outlined by the heads of the various military branches, but <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said Thursday no decisions have been made on whether to accept any of them. In September, <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> had asked the military leaders for ideas on how to take a more active role in the international drug battle. The Los Angeles Times, citing anonymous sources, reported Thursday that <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> was `` pretty positive'' toward a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> proposal to put an aircraft carrier battle group or a marine amphibious task force off the Colombian coast. `` It's a done deal,'' according to one administration official quoted by the newspaper. But <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, when asked about the report, said, `` It's not a done deal.'' <LOCATION> Cheney </LOCATION> this fall asked the military leaders to keep working on their proposals because of legal questions and issues of coordination among the different service branches, <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said. An administration official, who was asked about the scope of the flotilla proposal as outlined by the Times, said the report was `` not out of the realm of the things the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> has proposed.'' This official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> has been busy preparing the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>'s five-year budget plan and has not concentrated in recent weeks on the various services' anti-drug proposals <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said it is not clear yet when the administration will formally announce the specific steps the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> plans to take in support of a broad, government-wide anti-drug effort. Under the plan reported in the Times, the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> would operate an aircraft carrier battle group or a marine amphibious task force off <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>. Each group would be in position for one or two months, similar to training deployments. It was unclear whether the aircraft, their carriers or assigned amphibious assault ships would be allowed to chase suspected drug traffickers into Colombian territory. It also was unclear whether one or both Colombian coasts would be involved. The country has two coasts, one on the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> and one on the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION>, with the Isthmus of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> between them.

 This week's accident that left two Marines presumed killed in the western <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> was the latest in a string that prompted the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> to order an unprecedented two-day stand-down to review safety procedures earlier this month.

 Kids give up <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Claus </LOCATION> more easily than their parents, says one Santa who ought to know. For seven years, <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> has taken a break from his counseling practice to play <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION>. And this <PERSON> Kriss </PERSON> <PERSON> Kringle </PERSON> earned a Ph.D. studying how children decide to stop believing in him. Wide-eyed children this week watched as <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, 36, inspected the elaborate North Pole set at <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>' <ORGANIZATION> NorthPark </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, where he will spend the next month. <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION>, he said, teaches children an early lesson about giving, even though they are the recipients. But when it's time to give up the belief in a jolly old elf who travels to every house in the world on one magic night, children usually are ready, <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> said. Children `` told us that more often they felt proud and happy and good, basically because they felt more adultlike,'' said <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, who in his research at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> three years ago interviewed 75 9 - to 12-year-olds and their parents The parents react differently. `` They feel like their baby is growing up and it's all going by too fast,'' he said. Children reported that, as early as age 5, they begin doubting <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Claus </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> said. By age 9, most have decided they do n't believe in him `` Most kids reported at least going through two or three Christmases of increasing doubt before they decided for themselves to no longer believe,'' he said. `` So the first time they heard on the schoolyard somebody say ` <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION>'s not real,' it did n't necessarily crush them at all. The biggest surprise of his research, <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> said, was that children understood <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> as `` something that linked generations, something that you go through initially as a child and participate in one way and then later on you go through it again as a parent from the other side.'' Older children often adopt a parental role by professing to believe in <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> to younger siblings, he said. <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> said there is no single way for children to learn <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> is a myth. He tells parents to try to find out what the child believes. To children who declare <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> is <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION>, he gives a <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Claus </LOCATION> business card, a response that keeps him from having to tell a lie. `` Often they'll give you an indication of what they're looking for,'' <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> said. `` They may be looking for permission to continue to believe. They may be wanting to say ` Look, I'm old enough now. Let's put the cards on the table and get straight with this.'''

 Marine investigators are seeking the cause of a helicopter crash that killed the craft's pilot and co-pilot this week during carrier-based exercises in the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION>. The two crew members were declared dead Thursday following a 20-hour search by the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION>, officials said. The AH-IT Cobra helicopter crashed and sank in the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> during a night exercise. The search for the helicopter and its pilot and co-pilot was called off at 10 a.m. EST Thursday, said Capt. <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Kerstens </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman. `` They had been searching for almost a day at that point and decided there was no hope of finding them,'' Capt. <PERSON> Kerstens </PERSON> said. `` The pilots have been declared dead and their remains are unrecovered.'' The aircraft was operating from the helicopter carrier USS Iwo Jima in the western <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> off the coast of <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> when the crash occurred at 2:21 p.m. EST Wednesday, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION>. Capt. <PERSON> Kerstens </PERSON> said the cause of the crash was not immediately known but that an investigation has been started. The pilot was identified as Capt. <PERSON> Todd </PERSON> <PERSON> O. </PERSON> <PERSON> Travis </PERSON>, 29, of <LOCATION> Glasgow </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>; and the co-pilot-gunner as Capt. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Vidusek </PERSON>, 28, of <LOCATION> Naperville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Travis </PERSON> had been in the <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> five years and 10 months and <LOCATION> Vidusek </LOCATION> and been in the service six and one-half years The two officers were participating in a night carrier qualification and instrument refresher training exercise when the helicopter went down within sight of the ship, Capt. <PERSON> Kerstens </PERSON> said. She said <PERSON> Travis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Vidusek </PERSON> were not using night vision goggles as a part of the exercise. Alleged defects in night vision goggles and a high rate of military helicopter accidents involving their use have prompted several recent congressional inquiries and hearings. Capt. <PERSON> Kerstens </PERSON> said both pilots and the Iwo Jima had participated in a 48-hour <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> `` safety stand-down'' two weeks ago, during which almost all routine training was suspended for reviews of safety procedures. The unprecedented stand-down was ordered following a string of 10 accidents in less than a month. The pilots were assigned to <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medium </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Helicopter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Squadron </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> 365 </ORGANIZATION>, which is based at the <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Station </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, and is part of the 24th Marine Expedition Unit currently deployed with the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Sixth Fleet.

 Discovery's astronauts set their sights on a Sunday landing for a secret military space shuttle mission that sources said included deployment of a spy satellite. Silence has surrounded most of the classified flight, but <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> did interrupt the quiet briefly on Thanksgiving Day to announce that the shuttle was scheduled to land at 7:02 p.m. PST Sunday at <ORGANIZATION> Edwards </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION> `` The crew is doing well and the orbiter continues to perform satisfactorily,'' <ORGANIZATION> Mission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> commentator <PERSON> Billie </PERSON> <PERSON> Deason </PERSON> said in the brief status report Thursday evening. According to sources close to the project, a 2 -LCB- - ton, $ 300 million payload was released from the shuttle's cargo bay early Thursday morning about 10 hours into the flight It was a satellite capable of monitoring Soviet missile tests and eavesdropping on military and diplomatic communications in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and other countries, said the sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity. The satellite was to be maneuvered into a stationary orbit 22,300 miles above the equator, on a line of sight to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and all of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. The sources were unable to provide information on how the satellite was operating. A similar satellite was launched by a shuttle crew in 1985. They were expected to tend experiments for the `` Star Wars'' missile defense system and other military projects. The <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> has said the news blackout is necessary to try to keep the Soviets from finding out about what the astronauts are doing. Discovery is commanded by <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> Col. <PERSON> Frederick </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON>. His four-person crew: <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> Col. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Blaha </PERSON>, the pilot, and the three mission specialists, <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> Capt. <PERSON> Manley </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Story </PERSON> <PERSON> Musgrave </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kathryn </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornton </PERSON>. The flight, the fifth dedicated to the military, began Wednesday night with a spectacular nighttime liftoff that brightened the sky over the central <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> coast. The launch time was dictated by the secret cargo and its mission. On Thanksgiving Day, the astronauts dined on irradiated turkey, freeze-dried vegetables and cranberry sauce.

<DATELINE>SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The government's crackdown on the news media has kept Salvadorans in the dark about the most dramatic fighting of the civil war and may even have cost some lives, journalists and others say. On Nov. 12, the day after leftist rebels launched their biggest offensive of the 10-year-old struggle, the rightist government of President <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON> imposed a state of siege. The measure suspended rights guaranteed by the constitution, including freedom of expression. <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON> said Thursday the suspension will last a month. Since it began, the population has been able to cull only vague or mistaken perceptions of the battles. In the days after the offensive was launched, all radio and television stations were forced to join the `` cadena nacional'' _ the national network. The programming of <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cuscatlan </ORGANIZATION>, the military station, became the only source of broadcast information and opinion. Early in the first week of fighting, the cadena dedicated periodic segments to telephone callers, but it screened out leftists. Several callers denounced the Jesuit priests who ran the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> outside <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>. They called the priests subversive ideologues and suggested they be expelled or otherwise punished. On Nov. 16, they were indeed punished. A group of men broke into the campus residence where six of them were sleeping. They roused the priests, their housekeeper and her 15-year-old daughter and killed them all. Jesuit authorities say two witnesses saw men in army uniforms enter the house before the killings. In his homily at the priests' funeral, <PERSON> Arturo </PERSON> <PERSON> Rivera </PERSON> <PERSON> Damas </PERSON>, archbishop of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, cited `` the climate of hate fostered by the national network'' as a factor in the slayings. The government has installed censors at all television and radio stations. They make sure viewers and listeners find out only what the government believes strengthens its hand in the fighting. Predictably, the guerrillas are portrayed as murderous demons, while the armed forces are presented as the epitome of virtue. In order to downplay the magnitude of the rebel offensive, the simple facts _ even where the fighting was taking place _ were often withheld. `` The radio says everything is getting back to normal, and everything is under control of the armed forces and the government. But look for yourself,'' said one passer-by in the <LOCATION> Soyapango </LOCATION> district of the capital late last week. He pointed down the road. Fire from assault rifles and machine guns resounded less than a hundred yards away, where several barricaded guerrillas defended an intersection from army troops trying to advance. Some journalists have publicly made known their objections to the government interference. On Nov. 22, editors and reporters of the country's principal evening news program _ Channel 12's <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dia </LOCATION> _ stood together before the camera at the show's opening as the anchor read an anti-censorship message. They then signed off indefinitely. `` For ethical reasons, it is impossible for us to continue our broadcasts,'' said a solemn <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Mineros </PERSON>. `` We can not be what we are not.'' Others are willing only to speak privately. `` Because people did n't know what was going on beyond what they could see or hear in their own neighborhood, they did n't know what places were dangerous and what places were safe. The lack of information undoubtedly killed people,'' said a prominent local radio and print newsman who spoke on condition of anonymity. `` A real fear exists that they could kill you for what you say. Even if what you say is not against the government _ just for describing objectively what's going on,'' he said. Some opposition groups have also raised their voices. `` Freedom of expression has been reduced to zero, making it tremendously difficult for the democratic opposition to fulfill its function,'' said the <ORGANIZATION> Popular </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION> in a statement Thursday.

<TEXT>
 AIDS may be more widespread than previously thought, according to a study that found the disease grossly underreported in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>. The national <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> estimate that 10 percent to 30 percent of AIDS cases have not been properly reported to authorities. But a study published in today's Journal of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> says that of 153 AIDS cases that should have been reported to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> authorities from January 1986 through June 1987, 62 _ or 40 percent _ went unmentioned. `` If underreporting to the degree observed in this study is widespread in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, current estimates regarding the extent of the epidemic should be viewed with caution,'' the researchers wrote in the study. Since the early 1980s, 112,241 AIDS cases have been reported nationwide. Dr. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Buehler </PERSON>, a surveillance specialist on acquired immune deficiency syndrome at the <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION>, wrote in an editorial also published in today's journal: `` Underreporting minimizes the importance of the epidemic and threatens the public health response.'' Researchers led by a physician with <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carolina </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Preventive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> discovered omissions in reporting the disease by examining records of nearly 600,000 discharges from non-government hospitals in the state, the study said. `` It is unclear if the present findings apply to other states, although it seems reasonable to assume that similar underreporting may exist elsewhere,'' the researchers said. They identified AIDS cases by matching symptoms reported on the discharge records with a classification code developed by the <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION>. Cases the researchers identified as AIDS were then compared with those reported to the state's AIDS case registry, said Dr. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Conway </PERSON>, an epidemiologist who led the study and now works for the <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION>'s AIDS division. AIDS is one of several infectious diseases that doctors are required under state and federal regulations to report to state authorities, who then are to pass on the information to the <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Conway </PERSON> said. `` Penalties are not very stiff for non-reporting,'' he said. `` Doctors do n't get thrown in jail for not reporting diseases. The worst they get is a letter.'' Ninety-one of the 153 cases, or 59.5 percent, were properly reported, the study found. `` Patients were significantly more likely to be reported as AIDS-case persons if they were white than black,'' and males patients were more frequently reported than females, the researchers wrote. <PERSON> Conway </PERSON> said researchers could not explain why. He speculated that some might find reporting the cases too time-consuming, or in states like <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> where AIDS is not widespread, doctors may fail to recognize the disease's symptons. Some doctors also might be reluctant to reveal their patients' conditions, researchers said in the study In September 1987, after the period examined in the study, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> implemented an `` active surveillance program'' modeled after those in several other states, said Dr. <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>'s director of disease control and epidemiology. Under the new program, state officials contact physicians for information on AIDS cases, instead of waiting for them to report, <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> said. AIDS cripples the body's defenses against disease, leaving a person prey to life-threatening infections and certain cancers.

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON> said the assault by leftist rebels was a failure and he rejected their conditions for peace. His comments were punctuated by rebel bombs that exploded near his news conference. The series of bombs exploded about five blocks from where <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON> was speaking to reporters Thursday evening. <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON> jumped, but kept talking, telling everyone `` not to worry.'' No injuries were reported. <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON> termed `` nonsense'' the guerrillas' call for political negotiations leading to a cease-fire. The rightist government is demanding a truce first, then talks. `` Without a cease-fire the guerrillas will use the peace process for propaganda,'' said <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON>. Rebel leaders traveled to <LOCATION> Caracas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>, on Thursday to meet with President <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Andres </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON>. But Salvadoran government officials did n't plan to attend the meeting, dashing any hopes of talks. <PERSON> Perez </PERSON>, however, said he was in touch with <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON>'s government. `` I will say the same things to the representatives of the <ORGANIZATION> Farabundo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marti </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> that I said to the ministers of the <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON> government: We need to look for sincere solutions,'' <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> said. Meanwhile, traffic moved normally in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> for the first time since Nov. 11, when the offensive that killed more than 1,000 people was launched in the capital and several provinces. Many of the capital's 1 million residents tried to stock up on food, gas and other necessities. `` We've been cooking with wood,'' said truck driver <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Herrera </LOCATION>, standing in line for a fourth day at a natural gas distributorship with 50 other people. `` Since I do n't have any fuel for the truck I'm spending my days in line.'' At the <LOCATION> Soyapango </LOCATION> cemetery east of the city, gravediggers buried five bodies that had been left at the cemetery gates and said they expected more work. Much of the city was blacked out after darkness, and an electric company spokesman said damage during the battles left a 70 percent power outage. <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Farabundo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marti </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> had used the negotiating process as a propaganda tool while it prepared the largest offensive of the rebels' 10-year-old war against U.S.-backed governments. The guerrilla group has said it launched its offensive to prove that it can not be defeated and that the country can not have peace without accepting the rebels as a political factor. The guerrillas tried to steal <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON>'s show by setting off at least five small bombs in a ravine about five blocks away. His news conference was interrupted shortly after he claimed the army controlled the city, but he said `` anybody with a small group of people'' could `` launch terrorism.'' <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON> was surprised, but maintained his composure. The news conference was interrupted for 1 minute and 34 seconds, but then resumed even as helicopters roared overhead, dropping bombs and rocketing the slopes of a volcano where rebels were believed to be hiding. Explosions continued to be heard just north of the city into the late evening. The news conference was held in an open-air pavillion at military headquarters, which has been attacked numerous times during the war that has cost an estimated 71,000 lives. There was little fighting elsewhere as the country experienced a second day of relative calm. `` They tried it and lost,'' said <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON> of the rebel offensive. He said the guerrilla group must `` come to its senses and stop its aggression against the people. Then we can sit down to look at the few things we can do to facilitate their incorporation into the democratic process.'' Fighting in the city ended Wednesday morning after 12 <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Green </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Berets </ORGANIZATION> evacuated a luxury hotel that had been seized by rebels. The guerrillas renewed a cease-fire proposal made earlier, calling for a negotiations preceeding a truce. The government maintains that a cease-fire should take place before substantive political and territorial discussions take place. The guerrilla proposal included another clause rejected in the past that called for the armed forces to be represented at the talks; the guerrillas say that the army holds the real power.

<TEXT>
 The first trial in the scandal that felled a government and reshaped <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s political landscape opened today with two defendants denying bribery charges. The scandal is the most widespread ever in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, and the trials are expected to delve deeply into issues involving the structure of Japanese society. Five separate trials are starting between today and Dec. 15 on charges against two leading politicians, six bureaucrats and four executives of the <ORGANIZATION> Recruit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, an information services conglomerate. The company is accused of trying to win favors and exert influence by showering huge donations and stock bargains on the elite of Japanese government and business. At today's opening session, 59-year-old <PERSON> Takashi </PERSON> <PERSON> Kato </PERSON>, a former vice minister of labor, denied doing favors for Recruit in exchange for shares in a subsidiary of the conglomerate. But he acknowledged netting a $ 49,000 profit on shares bought cheaply from Recruit. `` I have considerably damaged the credibility of the labor administration and ... I deeply regret it,'' <PERSON> Kato </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Court </LOCATION>, where Judge <PERSON> Taketaka </PERSON> <PERSON> Nakagawa </PERSON> presided at the two-hour, 20-minute session. His co-defendant, 47-year-old <PERSON> Masao </PERSON> <PERSON> Tatsumi </PERSON>, a former Recruit executive, denied playing any role as an intermediary between <PERSON> Kato </PERSON> and Recruit's founder and former chairman, <PERSON> Hiromasa </PERSON> <PERSON> Ezoe </PERSON>. <PERSON> Ezoe </PERSON> is to be tried starting Dec. 15 on seven counts of bribery. The scandal centers on <PERSON> Ezoe </PERSON>, an ambitious entrepreneur who bombarded senior politicians and bureaucrats with huge donations and discounted shares in a Recruit subsidiary. Neither of today's defendants lodged a formal plea, which is not the procedure in Japanese courts. The prosecution alleges that <PERSON> Kato </PERSON> influenced <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> regulations in a way that benefited Recruit's booming business of publishing employment magazines. As the trials started, Prime Minister <PERSON> Toshiki </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaifu </PERSON> renewed his pledge of political reform. `` This is an incident that should never be repeated,'' <PERSON> Kaifu </PERSON> was quoting as saying by the <ORGANIZATION> Kyodo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Kaifu </PERSON> said his governing <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> is following new guidelines curbing political donations from corporations `` I think we have to work hard on political reform,'' he was quoted as saying. In August, <PERSON> Kaifu </PERSON> became the third prime minister in less than a year after the scandal forced <PERSON> Noboru </PERSON> <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> to step down in June. <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>'s successor, <PERSON> Sousuke </PERSON> <PERSON> Uno </PERSON>, resigned after the <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> suffered a crushing setback in July elections for the upper house of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> himself was found to have accepted $ 1.4 million in legal donations. Now, before elections for the more powerful lower house expected early next year, the new trials risk bringing out more damaging disclosures. In trying the defendants, prosecutors must show when a gift becomes a bribe. The determination by the court could become a severe test of the close links between business and government in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. The answers wo n't be known in full for years, given the slow pace of justice in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. `` The Recruit case is not just another political corruption trial, but it is a challenge to the <ORGANIZATION> way </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> is set up today,'' said <PERSON> Hiroshi </PERSON> <PERSON> Itakura </PERSON>, professor of criminal law at <ORGANIZATION> Nippon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> is a term that refers to the relationship between government and business. `` For those implicated in the case, it is almost as if they were doing what everyone else was doing, and one day they woke up and found themselves being criminal defendants in one of the largest bribery cases in history,'' he said. Bribery carries a maximum five-year prison sentence. Defendants whose trials start later include <PERSON> Takao </PERSON> <PERSON> Fujinami </PERSON>, a former chief <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> secretary; and <PERSON> Hisashi </PERSON> <PERSON> Shinto </PERSON>, ex-chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Nippon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telegraph </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s largest company. The scandals drove dozens of powerful men from their positions.

<TEXT>
 For ordinary East Germans, sweet revenge was a televised look inside the secrecy-shrouded compound housing <PERSON> Erich </PERSON> <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON> and other ousted members of his reviled old guard. East German television aired the highly critical report Thursday, including a talk with an indignant <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON> crony who snapped at the `` inflammatory campaign'' waged against the privileges of the past. For decades, the <LOCATION> Wandlitz </LOCATION> compound just north of <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> represented the ultimate in perks for the country's mightiest Communists. Imported wood paneling lined the walls of the 23 houses, some of them elegant villas. Bathroom fixtures rivaled those in luxurious houses in the West. The compound's own grocery store featured bananas, oranges and other fruits that were only a picturebook dream for most East Germans. Rumors abounded of all-night parties held in <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> Wandlitz </LOCATION> home, attended by the ruling elite and young women recruited from the Communist youth organization. A high wall, dozens of guards and a locked gate kept away would-be curiosity-seekers from the compound scornfully called `` Volvograd'' and `` <LOCATION> Honecker </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>.'' Only a few smuggled pictures existed of the inner area. Thursday night's special on state-run TV showed the insides of one of the houses _ and hinted that the furnishings may have been recently changed to make them look less attractive. There were also shots of the grocery store and boutique, as well as the outside of one fairly plain looking, stucco-covered home. It was the first such television report on the Communists' inner sanctum. <PERSON> Kurt </PERSON> <PERSON> Hager </PERSON>, ousted from the 21-member Politburo last month, indignantly spoke to the camera team on the Wandlitz grounds and denounced what he called a `` inflammatory campaign'' against the ousted <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON> inner circle. `` This is a necessity!'' he snapped, in defending the luxurious lifestyle cut off from the woes of the rest of the nation. He bitterly told a reporter all the attention gave him the feeling he was living in an `` internment camp.'' <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s new leaders, including some <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON> holdovers, have been increasingly focusing on their predecessors' alleged abuse of powers. That includes a disciplinary probe against <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON>, announced Thursday night. <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Egon </PERSON> <PERSON> Krenz </PERSON>, once <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON>'s protege, recently moved out of <LOCATION> Wandlitz </LOCATION> and showed a television crew around his new more modest home on the outskirts of <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> last weekend. <PERSON> Krenz </PERSON> told a television interviewer Thursday that `` retirees who once belonged to the Politburo'' are <PERSON> Wandlitz </PERSON>'s current residents although he did not specify how many are still there. Fourteen Politburo members went into `` retirement'' when they were ousted in the reshuffle that brought <ORGANIZATION> Krenz </ORGANIZATION> to power on Oct. 18. However, complicating matters somewhat is the fact that <PERSON> Guenter </PERSON> <PERSON> Schabowski </PERSON> and two other Wandlitz residents are Honecker-era holdovers in the new Politburo. <PERSON> Wandlitz </PERSON> was built in 1958 after the Hungarian uprising two years earlier made <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s top Communists fear for their safety. The government says that the top-ranking party members pay rent to live there. Compound admnistrator <PERSON> Gerd </PERSON> <PERSON> Schmidt </PERSON> invited reporters from the nation's state-run newspapers for a tour along with the television crew on Thursday. `` There were even rumors that in the last few nights, there were lines of trucks driving out with special goods,'' the television report said. <PERSON> Schmidt </PERSON> said he could n't confirm that, but like other East German officials claimed that the amount of Western goods has been drastically reduced under the <ORGANIZATION> Krenz </ORGANIZATION> leadership. How long <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON> and his ousted inner circle can still live there is uncertain. Suggestions for <PERSON> Waldlitz </PERSON>'s future use range from an old people's home to a museum memorializing the abuses of the past `` There have been thoughts about setting it up as a medical facility or as a rehabilitation center to justly serve the people,'' <PERSON> Schmidt </PERSON> told reporters. As <PERSON> Krenz </PERSON> and his colleagues scramble to gain the trust of the people, they also have cut out other privileges, including opening up once-restricted hunting areas to the general public. Many of the nation's star athletes have come under criticism for the perks they have long enjoyed.

<HEAD>Multivitamin Use in Early Pregnancy Linked to Fewer Spinal Defects</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Mothers who take multiple vitamins containing folic acid early in pregnancy are significantly less likely to bear babies with spina bifida and other spinal column defects, a new study concludes. The birth defects were about one-fourth as common among babies whose mothers took the over-the-counter vitamins than among babies whose mothers did n't take vitamins, according to a report in today's Journal of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. The apparent beneficial effect was limited to women who took the vitamins in the first six weeks of pregnancy, leading the researchers to suggest women begin taking vitamins with folic acid when they first start trying to conceive. The defects include spina bifida, in which incomplete closing of the bony casing around the spinal cord typically results in mild or severe paralysis. Another spinal column defect is anencephaly, in which major parts of the brain are lacking and death usually occurs within hours. Such defects occur in about 4,000 babies a year, or 1 to 2 in 1,000. The <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> report was based on a three-year study of 22,776 women, about half of whom took multivitamins containing folic acid. The occurrence of spinal column defects was 0.9 per 1,000, among babies whose mothers took the vitamins, compared to 3.3 per 1,000 among infants born to women who did n't use supplements. The study was conducted by Dr. <PERSON> Aubrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Milunsky </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Genetics </ORGANIZATION> at the <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medicine </ORGANIZATION> and colleagues. `` We believe that the combined data from this and other studies provide good evidence that folic acid-containing multivitamins taken during the first six weeks of pregnancy will prevent'' spinal column defects, the authors wrote. The study does n't prove folic acid prevents birth defects, said one expert, Dr. <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON>, a professor of pediatrics at <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>. `` Is it the vitamin itself. ... or are these women doing other things?'' <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON> asked. Discussing the implications, <PERSON> Milunsky </PERSON> noted most pregnant women see their doctors for the first time 8 to 10 weeks after conception. `` Almost all the fetal organs have been formed at that time,'' he said. `` An opportunity for useful intervention would have been lost.'' The function of folic acid _ found naturally in liver, leafy green vegetables, mushrooms, and <LOCATION> lima </LOCATION> and kidney beans _ is n't really known, <PERSON> Milunsky </PERSON> said Studies have n't ruled out the possibility that vitamins A, C, D or E _ alone or with folic acid _ protect against the defects, since all were contained in most of the multivitamins, the researchers noted. The researchers also cautioned that excessive doses of multivitamins could be harmful. Researchers noted a `` strikingly higher'' prevalence of the defects _ 13 per 1,000 _ among infants of women with a family history of spinal conditions who did n't take supplements, compared to women with such histories who did _ 3.5 per 1,000. The study group _ mostly white and well-educated _ was n't statistically representative of the population The frequency of spinal column defects is higher among poor whites and lower among blacks, <PERSON> Mulinsky </PERSON> said.

 The government has charged 21 students with arson in connection with a series of fires set during nationwide student protests in May. The students had been detained without charge since the protests, which left 43 people dead. The 21 defendants, who were charged Thursday, pleaded innocent and were granted bail. They each could face seven years in prison if convicted. The government alleges they were caught setting fire to private homes and government property in a <LOCATION> Lagos </LOCATION> suburb during the protests. The unrest began with student demonstrations opposing austerity measures imposed by the military government to revive the nation's economy Most of the country's universities were closed, some for several months, after the protests.

 A jury that took five days to find a 32-year-old electrician guilty of the torture-killings of two women on <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> highways will have the weekend off before deciding Monday whether he should be executed. The 12-member jury, which returned guilty verdicts on two of three murder charges against <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Pennell </PERSON> on Thursday, was allowed to go home after reaching its verdict. The panel must decide whether he should be sentenced to death or life in prison without parole. <PERSON> Pennell </PERSON> was accused of killing three women in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Castle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> between November 1987 and September 1988. The jury convicted <PERSON> Pennell </PERSON> of first-degree murder in the deaths of <PERSON> Shirley </PERSON> <PERSON> Ellis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Catherine </PERSON> <PERSON> DiMauro </PERSON> but could not come to a verdict in the case of <PERSON> Michelle </PERSON> <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON>.

<TEXT>
 Share prices on the <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> closed higher today with the market's key index setting a new high, while the dollar edged down. The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues gained 197.55 points, or 0.54 percent, finishing the week at a record closing of 36,484.47. It followed the previous record closing at 36,286.92 with a 227.05 point gain Wednesday. The dollar closed the week at 143.80 yen, down 0.08 yen from Wednesday's close of 143.88 yen. After opening at 143.89 yen, the currency ranged between 143.80 and 143.98 yen. Currency dealers said the market was active in cross-trading between the West German mark and the dollar, or the yen-mark trading, rather than the yen-dollar trading. `` The yen-dollar rate remained in a tight range because of a lack of new incentives,'' said <PERSON> Osamu </PERSON> <PERSON> Seto </PERSON>, a dealer with <ORGANIZATION> Mitsui </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>. On the stock market, the <ORGANIZATION> Nikkei </ORGANIZATION> index continued to post a record closing over investor expectatons for higher prices, securities dealers said. They said a recent decline in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> interest rates also contributed to encouraging many investors. An estimated 900 million shares changed hands, an identical amount traded Wednesday. `` For today, the declining <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> interest rate helped a lot,'' said <PERSON> Masaya </PERSON> <PERSON> Hashizume </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Nikko </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, a major Japanese brokerage. The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> central bank, lowered its federal funds rate, a short-term lending rate between commercial banks, from 8.50 percent to 8.25 percent on Wednesday. Low <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> interest rates would make dollar-denominated securities less attractive to investors from other countries. Also lower interest rates tend to push down the dollar's value. Currency and stock markets were closed in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> Thursday, a national holiday.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Dubcek </PERSON>, whose brand of `` socialism with a human face'' was crushed in the 1968 Soviet-led invasion of <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>, is back in the limelight drawing cheers from hundreds of thousands of countrymen. His public endorsement of the pro-democracy tide sweeping the nation follows months of increasingly outspoken criticism of the leadership that ousted him from the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> 19 years ago. Working as a low-level employee of the state forestry services, he remained for a long time in virtual seclusion, living with his family in a hillside house overlooking the Slovak capital of <LOCATION> Bratislava </LOCATION>. Permanent police surveillance of his house was lifted after a 1987 visit to <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> by Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, whose perestroika, or restructuring program largely follows the lines of <PERSON> Dubcek </PERSON>'s ill-fated `` Prague Spring.'' Slowly and cautiously, <PERSON> Dubcek </PERSON> has prepared a return to public life and perhaps even to a leading role, although he has kept silent as to his plans. He celebrates his 68th birthday on Monday. His name has been chanted by hundreds of thousands of demonstrators in the pro-democracy rallies that began Nov. 17 and seem to have become a fixture in <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> has awarded him its 1989 <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> Peace Prize, saying he `` symbolizes for all Europeans our best hopes for peaceful reform in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>.'' He is expected to collect the prize in <LOCATION> Strasbourg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> in December. A trip to <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> to receive an honorary doctorate a year ago was <ORGANIZATION> Dubcek </ORGANIZATION>'s first voyage abroad since he returned from a brief spell as ambassador to <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> in 1970, shortly before his expulsion from the party along with half a million others. <PERSON> Milos </PERSON> <PERSON> Jakes </PERSON>, the current <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leader, oversaw those purges. <PERSON> Dubcek </PERSON> was barred from traveling again to <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> earlier this year to attend the Italian <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> congress </ORGANIZATION>, where he could have met one of the leading Soviet reformers, <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Yakovlev </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> made the startling move of broadcasting a lengthy interview with <ORGANIZATION> Dubcek </ORGANIZATION> in April on state-run TV. The broadcast prompted a formal protest from <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> to its <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact ally. `` Society is trembling in the clutches of hopelessness,'' he told the party's Politburo in a nine-page letter leaked to the media in August, telling the leadership it would lose power unless it changed course. `` Do not leave the removal of deformations of the past to either justified pressure or chance,'' he said, anticipating growing demands for reforms. In September, he sided for the first time publicly with human rights activists in demanding the release of two dissidents accused of anti-state activities. One has since been released and the other was acquitted of charges against him but remains jailed pending a prosecution appeal. And early this month, <PERSON> Dubcek </PERSON>'s role in the `` Prague Spring'' was given favorable footage on Soviet TV. Included was an interview in which he spoke of `` very sad recollections'' about the crushing of the reforms. To date, <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> has not publicly disassociated itself from the 1968 invasion, saying it `` respects'' the <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> leadership's view that the invasion was necessary. However, the parliaments of reformist <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> have condemned their country's participation in the invasion In an open letter published in this week's <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> News, prominent Soviet writer <PERSON> Daniil </PERSON> <PERSON> Granin </PERSON> apologized for the invasion, calling it `` illegal, ruinous intervention'' that brought to power `` dogmatic Stalinists.'' <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>'s leading opposition group, Civic Forum, has asked <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> to explicitly brand the invasion as illegal, which would amount to a disavowal of <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION>'s present leaders. A senior non-Communist Czechoslovak politician said <PERSON> Dubcek </PERSON> continues to have broad grass-roots support in the party and could have a vital role in keeping it in power. Communists polled more than 50 percent in the last free elections before they seized power in a 1948 coup. `` I would not bet on them losing in a new free election if <PERSON> Dubcek </PERSON> was back in charge,'' the politician said on condition of anonymity.

 Residents have been allowed to return to the second of three apartment buildings evacuated Aug. 19 after a steam pipe explosion that killed two people and showered the neighborhood with asbestos. Tenants of the condominium in <LOCATION> Gramercy </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> were allowed to move back into their apartments Thanksgiving Day, after <ORGANIZATION> Consolidated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Edison </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, owner of the pipe, cleaned the building of the cancer-causing asbestos. Con Ed, which paid for those displaced by the blast to stay in hotels or other apartments, will cease paying for temporary accommodations after Dec. 4. In the well-to-do neighborhood on <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Side </LOCATION>, the street where the blast occurred is still blocked to traffic while asbestos decontamination continues. Residents of one of the three affected buildings returned home last month. The third is expected to be habitable by January.

<TEXT>
 In a break with its guerrilla allies, <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> has called for a gradual, step-by-step settlement of <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>'s war. The <LOCATION> Cambodian </LOCATION> resistance and most governments involved in efforts to end the war say it must be resolved with a single package tackling all the major issues. However, <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>'s Prime Minister <PERSON> Chatichai </PERSON> <PERSON> Choonhavan </PERSON>, impatient with slow progress toward an agreement, has said the combatants first could agree to a truce and international verification of a Vietnamese troop pullout. He said they could then take on more vexing issues, such as power-sharing. Along with <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> is the main backer of a guerrilla coalition fighting the government <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> installed in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> with an invasion 11 years ago. `` The Cambodian issue must be solved, and in order to advance toward a comprehensive solution ... we could and we should move step by step to settle the problem,'' <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hanoi </ORGANIZATION> today quoted Deputy Premier <PERSON> Bhichai </PERSON> <PERSON> Rattakul </PERSON> as saying. <PERSON> Bhichai </PERSON> spoke Thursday at a news conference at the end of a three-day official visit to <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s capital, with other senior government officials and businessmen. According to Radio <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION>, monitored in <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bhichai </PERSON> said informal peace talks being organized by <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION> should be held as soon as possible. <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION>'s Foreign Minister <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Alatas </PERSON> said Thursday that could happen by February. <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION> is among the nations that have called for a comprehensive solution. The new talks, co-chaired by <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, represent an attempt to resume the dialogue after a month of failed international talks in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> in August. Those talks collapsed over the Cambodian government's refusal to share power with the communist <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>, which killed hundreds of thousands of people in the 1970s before it was ousted by <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s invading forces. The <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> now has the strongest army of a three-faction resistance coalition.

<HEAD>Japan, U.S. Using Lasers to Measure Atmospheric Winds</HEAD>

<DATELINE>FUSSA, Japan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Japanese scientists are flying over the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> in a DC-8 jet and firing laser beams through the atmosphere, part of a project that may double the accuracy of weather forecasts, officials said today. Scientists are using the laser to measure atmospheric wind patterns. They hope to use the measurements to design a satellite equipped with a similar laser that will be able to measure wind flows throughout the world, said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Theon </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>. `` We believe that if we can measure winds all over the globe, we can double the accuracy of weather forecasts,'' he said. `` This will be a breakthrough in our ability to understand weather and how it works.'' The <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> plane uses lasers to shoot out pulses of light that are reflected back by dust, pollen and water particles carried by the atmospheric winds. The delay and frequency change of the reflections are used to calculate the wind flows in a 9-mile cross-section of the atmosphere. Information from the plane's measurements will be combined with data from nine Japanese land-based stations also using lasers to measure atmosphere winds, <PERSON> Toshikazu </PERSON> <PERSON> Itabe </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Japanese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Posts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telecommunications </ORGANIZATION> told reporters here at the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Yokota </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Air </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Base </LOCATION>. Improved knowledge of air flows also is expected to give scientists a better understanding of how heat and moisture are transmitted through the atmosphere, <PERSON> Theon </PERSON> said. That should improve the accuracy of predictions of rising global temperatures linked to pollutants in the atmosphere that trap the earth's heat, called the `` greenhouse effect.'' Scientists have predicted that the earth's average temperature may rise from 3 degrees to 6 degrees F -RRB- over the next 40 years if the amount of such pollutants in the atmosphere continue to rise at current rates. Such changes could cause major climatic changes, including a partial melting of the polar ice caps that might flood coastal areas and entire island nations. `` The big remaining question regarding climate is the effect of clouds,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Spinhirne </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> scientist on board the plane. `` In current climatic models temperatures could fluctuate as much as -LRB- 3.5-5 .5 degrees -RRB- depending on the effect of clouds on temperature flows. The laser technique, he said, allows much more accurate mapping of cloud patterns and movements than previous measurement methods. <PERSON> Itabe </PERSON> said negotiations are underway between <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s Science and <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> on cooperation in building the satellite system. <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> hopes to launch the satellite by the late 1990s, <PERSON> Theon </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Researchers: Drug Causes Remission of Colon Cancer in Mice</HEAD>

<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A new drug derived from a <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> tree has triggered remissions of colon cancer in laboratory mice, doctors said in a preliminary report. `` In 20 years in this lab, we've never seen anything like this. We have animals that are tumor-free,'' said Dr. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Stehlin </PERSON>, scientific director at the <ORGANIZATION> Stehlin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cancer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Joseph </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>. During two years of experiments, researchers said they treated about 100 mice with three kinds of human colon cancer: slow -, medium - and Once the mice began developing tumors, they were divided into two groups: those receiving the new drug, 9-amino Camptothecin, or 9-AC; and those receiving no treatment. Most mice showed no trace of residual cancer after being treated with 9-AC for several months, doctors said. The untreated mice died. Some mice treated with 9-AC are still alive after surviving the equivalent, in human terms, of 20 years, <PERSON> Stehlin </PERSON> said at a briefing this week. The findings were published today in the journal Science. `` This is a preliminary report,'' he said. `` Obviously, more work needs to be done with additional colon cancers and other forms of cancer that are not responsive to the standard anti-cancer agents.'' Colon cancer is the third most common cancer in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> with 147,000 new cases reported each year. The disease, most commonly treated by surgery, takes about 60,000 lives annually. <PERSON> Beppino </PERSON> <PERSON> Giovanella </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Joseph </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cancer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION>, said all three tumors used in the experiments had not responded to major known anti-cancer drugs administered at maximum tolerable doses. <PERSON> Giovanella </PERSON> also said two mice injected with lung cancer have shown a regression of their cancer after being treated with 9-AC. Very little progress has been made in colon cancer treatment in the past 40 years, <PERSON> Stehlin </PERSON> said. Chemotherapy and immunotherapy have had little effect and the use of the drug levamisole with 5-fluorouracil improves the survival rate in about 15 percent of patients, he said. Researchers said mice with the slow-growing cancer responded to 9-AC within 10 days and by 20 days were tumor-free. The mice with the medium-growing cancer took about 10 days to start reacting and in about 25 days were in remission, according to researchers. Mice treated with the fast-growing cancer took 21 days before responding to 9-AC. The 9-AC drug is a derivative of camptothecin, an alkaloid extracted from a Chinese tree. Dr. <PERSON> Monroe </PERSON> <PERSON> Wall </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Triangle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> isolated camptothecin in the 1960s. It was tested on humans but was soon discarded because of its excessive toxicity. Researchers are hoping to find out whether 9-AC is as toxic as its parent. If approved by the <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, the researchers could start tests on humans as early as next year. Doctors at <ORGANIZATION> Johns </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hopkins </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medicine </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION> have identified camptothecin as a potent inhibitor of topoisomerase I, an enzyme present in animal cells which controls cell division. Studies at <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> say cancerous colons usually have more topoisomerase I than normal colons.

<HEAD>Thanksgiving Dinner Awaited Scientist Who Emerged from Test Module</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A scientist emerged after spending three weeks alone in a sealed, self-contained world, hungry for companionship and Thanksgiving turkey. Biologist <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Leigh </PERSON> ended the 21-day test Thursday, emerging after her record-breaking stay inside a sealed, greenhouselike module that generates its own food, air and water. The device is part of a program to explore technologies for replicating <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>'s environment in space Ms. <PERSON> Leigh </PERSON>, 39, emerged from the airtight, glass-and-steel module just in time for Thanksgiving dinner, and was hugged by <PERSON> Abigail </PERSON> <PERSON> Alling </PERSON>, director of the project's marine ecological system. `` She was quite struck by the beauty of the system,'' Ms. <PERSON> Alling </PERSON> said in a telephone interiew. Wearing a bright red jumpsuit, Ms. <PERSON> Leigh </PERSON> was greeted by co-workers, friends and reporters, but was n't allowed to speak, before being whisked away for a medical exam like an astronaut back from space. Ms. <PERSON> Leigh </PERSON> entered the module Nov. 2 for the longest-ever stay inside an ecosystem entirely independent of <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>'s, breaking Ms. <PERSON> Alling </PERSON>'s mark of five days. The structure is a test for Biosphere II, a $ 30 million module under construction on a ranch about 30 miles north of <LOCATION> Tucson </LOCATION>. Next September, four men and four women will enter the much larger module for two years to determine whether humans can duplicate Earth's life systems for use in space. Inside the sealed system, everything is recycled _ air, water and waste material _ and the occupants also produce all their own food. Extensive medical monitoring while she was inside found the confinement did n't seem to harm Ms. <PERSON> Leigh </PERSON>'s health, doctors said. `` The one thing that I really do miss is just companionship,'' Ms. <PERSON> Leigh </PERSON> said Wednesday by telephone. `` Other than that, I'm quite content on the inside. I feel like I could stay in here indefinitely. Ms. <PERSON> Leigh </PERSON>'s meals, averaging about 2,000 calories a day, included such module-grown foods as sweet potatoes, kohlrabi, jalapeno peppers and tangerines. She also had a tank of tilapia fish. Water for drinking, cooking and showering was removed from the air. All waste water was fed into a marsh recycling system. The botanist had to repair the loose belt of a large fan that heats and cools the module, and had to fine-tune the irrigation system.

 An unmanned barge carrying 5 million gallons of jet fuel was snared and towed to a harbor after it drifted for more than a day near the site of the Exxon Valdez oil spill, the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> said. `` It had about 12 hours remaining until it would have hit one of the reefs or islands at the entrance to Prince <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sound </PERSON>,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> Lt. <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Bobalek </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Juneau </LOCATION>.

The crew of a <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> plane spotted the barge Wednesday, and a radio buoy with a strobe light was dropped to the vessel by helicopter, spokesman <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> French </PERSON> said. By early Thursday, the tug that reported the incident had the barge on a towline, French said. Coast Guard officials had yet to determine why the barge broke loose. Officials had considered summoning an <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> ordnance team to blow up the barge and burn off the fuel before the vessel could run aground and spill its cargo. `` This episode was too close for comfort, but we are relieved that it had a happy ending,'' said <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Lamoreaux </PERSON>, an Anchorage-based supervisor for the <ORGANIZATION> Alaska </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conservation </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Bobalek </PERSON> said it was hard to determine how much damage the fuel would have caused if the barge's 20 cargo tanks had ruptured.

<TEXT>
 Clear skies returned to much of the East and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> after a snowy Thanksgiving, but it stayed cold today as far south as <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and northern <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. Meanwhile, snow was expected today in the <ORGANIZATION> Cascade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mountains </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oregon </ORGANIZATION> and parts of the <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lakes </LOCATION> region. Thursday's storm complicated holiday travel and prompted cancellation of some high school Thanksgiving Day football games in the Northeast. Coastal areas were hardest hit; <LOCATION> Yarmouth </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, on <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cod </LOCATION> received 14 inches of snow. `` We are certainly starting our winter season off with a bang,'' said <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Poirier </PERSON>, a meteorologist with the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> had its first white Thanksgiving in 51 years. The 4.7 inches of snow that fell there was a record for Nov. 23 and for Thanksgiving Day. Light snow and snow showers were in the <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lakes </LOCATION> region, with snow advisories in effect this morning in parts of <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> and western <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> state. Rain showers extended across the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Northwest </LOCATION> and showers and thunderstorms were over southern <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. But dry weather prevailed across the rest of the nation Thursday and was continuing today. Temperatures stayed below freezing all day Thursday and into this morning across much of the area from the <LOCATION> Dakotas </LOCATION> through the Great Lakes region to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, with highs in the teens and single digits in eastern <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> and northern <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>. It was only 38 degrees in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, and 40 in <LOCATION> Jacksonville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, this morning, and freeze warnings were posted during the night for south central and southeastern <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. But several southern <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> cities had record high temperatures in the mid - to high 80s Thursday Afternoon highs Thursday were in the 40s and 50s across much of the western <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, with 70s and lower 80s in southern <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and southern <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 An editorial on state-run radio today indicated the government may soon lift some of the emergency press restrictions in effect for more than three years. On Thursday, President F.W. <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON> said officials in <LOCATION> Boksburg </LOCATION> must allow people of all races to own businesses. Right-wing whites have tried to maintain strict segregation in the city. The editorial broadcast on government-run Radio <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> said: `` The lifting of media restrictions that are no longer relevant in today's relaxed political climate will promote a more open public debate on crucial national issues.'' It said the move would also help promote `` more comprehensive and fruitful negotiations'' on the country's political and constitutional makeup. The restrictions have been in place since June 12, 1986. They cover photographing, reporting or broadcasting political unrest, police action, statements the government considers subversive, details about people detained without trial, and information about boycotts. Under the rules, dozens of journalists have been arrested for being at the scene of news events. Several newspapers have been closed temporarily, and one, the New Nation, is currently under threat of immediate closure. Today's editorial gave no date for when the rules would be removed. Reacting to the president's decision on <LOCATION> Boksburg </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> called his proclamation an attempt to `` destroy white community life.'' <LOCATION> Boksburg </LOCATION>, 12 miles east of <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION>, has attracted worldwide attention since members of the far-right <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> won control of the <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> last year. Local lawmakers in the past year have reimposed rigid apartheid policies, aside from the ownership ban, that were lifted when the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> controlled the city. These include resegregating public toilets, the park, the library and a sports complex. Blacks, who outnumber the city's 50,000 whites, responded with a boycott of white-owned businesses and have been using public facilities in defiance of the council. Blacks called off the year-old business boycott last week after de Klerk called for repeal of the Separate Amenities Act, a national law that allows segregation of many public facilities. Housing, schools and hospitals are not covered by the act and will remain segregated nationwide. `` We've succeeded in bringing <LOCATION> Boksburg </LOCATION> to the attention of people everywhere,'' said <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Jeffreys </PERSON>, secretary of the anti-apartheid <ORGANIZATION> Save </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boksburg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, after <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON>'s proclamation `` The government had no choice but to act.'' The national government has the authority to overrule municipalities on some issues, including the question of whether blacks can own businesses in downtown areas. <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON>'s proclamation, which allows a person of any race to operate a business in <LOCATION> Boksburg </LOCATION>, is partly symbolic, <PERSON> Jeffreys </PERSON> said. Black businessmen probably will keep their shops in the black townships, he said. However, there are Indian shopkeepers in <LOCATION> Boksburg </LOCATION>'s downtown business district who no longer face eviction because of race, he said. The Indians have generally used whites to serve as front men to obtain necessary licenses. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, to which <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON> belongs, was responsible for the <LOCATION> Boksburg </LOCATION> law restricting business ownership to whites. The Conservatives kept the policy when they took over last year. `` The government sincerely hopes that the negative image attributed to <LOCATION> Boksburg </LOCATION>, both locally and abroad ... is now something of the past,'' the minister of planning and provincial affairs, <PERSON> Hernus </PERSON> <PERSON> Kriel </PERSON>, said in announcing <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON>'s proclamation. <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON>'s proclamation is the latest in a series of gestures to the disenfranchised black majority, which still has no vote in national affairs. The government has been allowing peaceful anti-apatheid gatherings and last month freed several jailed activists from prison.

<HEAD>New Program In Atlanta: Teacher Of Year Goes To Bat For Colleagues</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BYRD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The Teacher of the Year in this city's public schools got a plaque, a handshake and a new job as `` teachers' ombudsman,'' a liaison between the administration and her colleagues in the classroom In what school officials say is believed to be the first program of its kind in the nation, the city's most honored teacher is being asked to spend the following year representing teachers' concerns before the superintendent. `` You could call me the morale officer for the school system,'' said <PERSON> Deborah </PERSON> <PERSON> Battle </PERSON>, a vocational education teacher from <ORGANIZATION> Carver </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, the first ombudsman. She was <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>'s Teacher of the Year for 1988-89. Superintendent <PERSON> Jerome </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> said the ombudsman is a `` win-win situation.'' `` It provides me with an additional communication vehicle to the teachers,'' <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> said. `` It gives some type of reward to the teacher of the year by allowing her to interact with the system, and she's been able to help us maneuver more with the grass-roots people.'' Ms. <PERSON> Battle </PERSON>'s duties have ranged from helping mediate disputes between teachers to solving payroll problems and answering questions about retirement and sick leave. `` I even had a parent who came in last week,'' she said. `` She was having a problem with her child and a teacher, and she did n't know where to turn. Ms. Battle is also working on organizing the Teacher of the Year nominees from each school to work on developing ideas to improve classroom performance. `` These people were chosen by their faculties as their most outstanding teacher,'' she said. `` What better way to have them provide professional leadership?'' Ms. <PERSON> Battle </PERSON>, 38, said that she was ready to try something different after 11 years of teaching, and likes her new post so much that she would consider staying on the administrative side. `` I'm weighing my options,'' she said. `` I really am enjoying it. ... It's a very important job, because the longer I do this, the more I've found that on so many boards and groups of people making decisions concerning education about education, I'm the only teacher. I'm the only person there who can speak for teachers, as to how something's going to be received by the children. `` It just amazed me that all these decisions are made _ what we do and how we do it _ and teachers are never there.''

 With batting eyelashes and smudged mascara, a north <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> woman is a traffic-stopping look-alike of <PERSON> Tammy </PERSON> <PERSON> Faye </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>, and is cashing in on it on the party circuit. <PERSON> Teresa </PERSON> <PERSON> Martens </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> said she jokingly told her daughter's modeling agent about the time she dressed up and was mistaken for the televangelist Now, `` She's the hottest thing I've got,'' said <PERSON> Shirley </PERSON> <PERSON> Lowry </PERSON>, owner of Party People in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>. Party People books celebrity look-alikes for special events in the <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> area. `` When I tell people my list of celebrity look-alikes, people laugh when I say <PERSON> Tammy </PERSON> <PERSON> Faye </PERSON>'s name,'' Ms. <PERSON> Lowry </PERSON> said. `` <PERSON> Tammy </PERSON> <PERSON> Faye </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> is the most wanted look-alike.'' Last month, a federal judge sentenced televangelist <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>, Mrs. <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>'s husband, to a 45-year prison term for fraud and conspiracy. At one recent appearance at a business meeting, Mrs. <PERSON> Martens </PERSON> burst crying into the room. `` Look out or you'll be in jail yourself,'' she warned one executive. `` I've seen you down at the Cheetah,'' she said to another, referring to an <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> nude-dancing club. Rates are $ 100 an hour or $ 500 a day. Ms. <PERSON> Lowry </PERSON> said she sees potential to reach bigger markets. `` <PERSON> Teresa </PERSON> impresses me because she has not been in the theater,'' Ms. <PERSON> Lowry </PERSON> said. `` She is a natural comedian. She sings, she acts, and she can portray <PERSON> Tammy </PERSON> <PERSON> Faye </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> so well.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Martens </PERSON>, 42, said she had been mistaken for Mrs. <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> before. Once when her daughter was a baby, Mrs. <PERSON> Martens </PERSON> said two women kept looking at her during a layover in a <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> airport. `` I thought, ` Oh no, baby burpie, blouse undone, zipper check,''' she said. `` I mean, these women were staring.'' The two have never met. Because of the religious implications involved with her impersonation, Mrs. <PERSON> Martens </PERSON> said she tries to be sensitive to the fact that many people were victims in the downfall of the <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> empire. `` I want to be very careful not to offend anyone,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Martens </PERSON> said. `` I am having fun, and people come up to me and thank me for making them laugh. `` <PERSON> Tammy </PERSON> <PERSON> Faye </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> does not seem to intimidate men or women,'' she added. `` People want to talk to her. They feed me questions, and I answer them. A lot of people want to know how <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> is doing, so I answer how I think he is doing.''

<HEAD>Red Square Pilot Mathias Rust Accused in Stabbing</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HAMBURG, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Mathias </PERSON> <PERSON> Rust </PERSON>, the young West German who landed his single-engine plane in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s Red Square, has been accused of stabbing a nurse who resisted when he tried to kiss her, authorities said. Rust, who spent more than a year imprisoned in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> after he flew his plane past Soviet air defenses, turned himself in Thursday two hours after fleeing a Hamburg-area hospital, police said. The 21-year-old was working there as an orderly under the federal <ORGANIZATION> Civilian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, a pacifist alternative to compulsory military service in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, police said. According to police, Rust pulled an 18-year-old student nurse into a hospital changing room, locked the door, and tried to kiss her. When she resisted, she was stabbed twice in the stomach, police said. Rust fled the hospital after the incident shortly after 2 p.m., but called police at 4:30 p.m. and was then taken into custody. He was not immediately charged. Newspapers reported today that the teen-ager underwent surgery and described her condition as serious. Authorities declined to provide other details. Rust captured international headlines after his dramatic feat on May 28, 1987, when he piloted a borrowed Cessna across more than 500 miles of heavily defended Soviet territory. His stunt triggered a shakeup in the Soviet <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>. He was sentenced in September 1987 to serve four years in prison after a conviction for violating international air safety regulations, illegal entry into the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and malicious hooliganism. However, Soviet authorities pardoned him in August 1988 and expelled him to his home in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. He said in an interview this year that he chose the <ORGANIZATION> Civilian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> because he was opposed to violence.

<HEAD>Bomb Placed By Home of Doctor Who Transplanted Soldier's Heart Into

<TEXT>
 Authorities found a bomb today outside the home of a doctor who transplanted the heart of a slain <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldier into a Palestinian, police said. An underground Jewish group said it placed the device. Police found a similar crude bomb at the home of a professor who invited a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> activist to speak at <ORGANIZATION> Hebrew </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, police spokesman <PERSON> Uzi </PERSON> <PERSON> Sandori </PERSON> said. An anonymous caller telephoned the Israeli dailies <ORGANIZATION> Yediot </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ahronot </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Maariv </ORGANIZATION> early today and claimed a group called the Sicarites placed the bombs at the two homes. `` If they do not leave the country within a week, we will wait for them in a dark corner with a machine gun,'' Maariv quoted the caller as saying. The Sicarites, named after first century Jewish zealots who battled the Romans, have claimed responsibility for at least nine attacks on Arabs and liberal Jews, including the machine gun slaying of an Arab outside <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Old </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> on April 10. No arrests were ever made in that slaying, and <PERSON> Sandori </PERSON> said no suspects have been detained in connection with the bombs found today. <PERSON> Sandori </PERSON> descibed the device found outside the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> home of Dr. <PERSON> Dov </PERSON> <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON> as a glass seltzer bottle rigged with gunpowder and a candle. He said the candle was apparently meant to set off an explosion, but both devices were found before exploding. The other bomb was found outside the home of <PERSON> Yoram </PERSON> <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Porat </PERSON>, who invited <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> activist <PERSON> Feisal </PERSON> <PERSON> Husseni </PERSON> to speak at <ORGANIZATION> Hebrew </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> last week. <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON>, one of two surgeons who performed the heart transplant on the soldier slain by Palestinian attackers, said it was not the first time he has been threatened since the Nov. 15 operation. `` There have been anonymous phone calls to my wife that I was hurt, for example, and was hospitalized. But I was at home at the time,'' he told <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> radio. `` I am astonished there are people in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> who can not separate medicine from politics,'' he said. The heart was removed from Sgt. <PERSON> Zeev </PERSON> <PERSON> Traum </PERSON>, 40, who died of head wounds suffered in an ambush by <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> guerrillas in the occupied <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. It was transplanted into <PERSON> Hanna </PERSON> <PERSON> Khader </PERSON>, 54, a former hotel manager from Arab east <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Hadassah </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Ruth </PERSON> <PERSON> Mekel </PERSON> said today that <PERSON> Khader </PERSON> was in good condition. His wife, <PERSON> Mary </PERSON>, said her husband could speak and also walk with some help but can not yet eat solid food. She said she could not understand why some Jews were angry about the transplant. `` They previously received organs from Arabs, so why are they making this a problem?'' she said in a telephone interview. Doctors said <PERSON> Khader </PERSON> was chosen for the operation over dozens of other Jews and Arabs on a transplant waiting list because <PERSON> Traum </PERSON>'s tissue most closely matched his News of the transplant was leaked to the press, sparking angry reactions from right-wing Israeli groups. Some Palestinians have accused authorities of leaking the news to gain favorable publicity for <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>.

The bill would allow the more than 30,000 Chinese students in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> who hold exchange visitor visas visas to apply for a change in visa status within four years. Currently, holders of such visas must return home for at least two years before applying for a different visa. The legislation is meant to protect the thousands of Chinese students in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> who participated in demonstrations or voiced support for the repressed pro-democracy movement in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> last spring. The bill must now go to President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who has not said if he will sign it. The Chinese government has vowed there will be no reprisals against the students. However, many of the students say they are worried they will face punishment or even imprisonment upon their return. The Foreign Ministry on Sunday also protested congressional moves to extend economic sanctions against <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. The crackdown has strained Chinese-U.S. ties more than at any time since diplomatic relations were established in 1979.

 A passenger bus plunged 50 feet into a river from a bridge east of the capital, killing 78 people and injuring 26 in the nation's worst bus crash, police said today. The bus apparently had a blowout on a front tire late Thursday and hurtled into the Chivake river near the town of <LOCATION> Murehwa </LOCATION>, 45 miles east of <LOCATION> Harare </LOCATION>, authorities said. It overturned in the water, crushing the roof. Police said most of the passengers were crushed to death. There was no immediate word on how many passengers were riding in the bus, but officials said it was overcrowded. The bus was owned by the private <ORGANIZATION> Nhamburo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. President <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Mugabe </PERSON> declared the accident a national disaster. <PERSON> Mugabe </PERSON>, who visited the crash site, said the wreckage indicated the overcrowded bus was speeding when it plunged into the river bed. Home Affairs Minister <PERSON> Moven </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahachi </PERSON>, who also visited the scene, said 78 people were killed and 26 seriously injured, `` and the death toll will probably increase.'' Several passengers died on their way to hospital after being freed from the wreckage by firefighters with cutting torches, said the spokesman. Rescuers were working at the scene through the night. First to the crash were local villagers, who used farm tools to free some people. The country has suffered a record number of bus crashes this year. In August, 34 people died when their bus overturned and burst into flames about 10 miles north of <LOCATION> Harare </LOCATION>. Since September, 17 bus accidents have been reported. Bus owners have said they can not get hard currency to buy new tires or spares. In 1982, 61 farmers and their wives and children died when their bus crashed into the Dande river near the town of <LOCATION> Guruve </LOCATION>, north of <LOCATION> Harare </LOCATION>.

 Tearful and silent, the mothers of two Soviet soldiers captured by anti-Communist guerrillas in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> arrived today to claim sons they have n't seen for more than two years. Pvts. <PERSON> Andrei </PERSON> <PERSON> Lopukh </PERSON> and <PERSON> Valery </PERSON> <PERSON> Prokapchuk </PERSON>, both 20, will be the first Soviet prisoners of war released since the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> ended nine years of involvement in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s civil war in February, officials said. Soviet diplomats said both were captured in 1987, but Afghan rebels earlier claimed <PERSON> Lopukh </PERSON> had deserted to their side. They will be released within days under arrangements nearly completed among Afghan rebels, <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION>, the diplomats said. <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> Lopukh </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Byelorussia </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Valentina </PERSON> <PERSON> Prokapchuk </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> Ukraine </LOCATION> wept as they arrived by chartered <ORGANIZATION> Aeroflot </ORGANIZATION> jet with a five-member delegation including parents of other soldiers missing in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. They declined to speak with reporters. `` These are two very simple, plain <LOCATION> Russian </LOCATION> women _ suffering women who thought they had lost their sons,'' said <PERSON> Iona </PERSON> <PERSON> Andronov </PERSON>, spokesman of <LOCATION> Nadezhka </LOCATION> -LRB- Hope -RRB-, a private group that works for the release of Soviet POWs. `` But they soon will become the happiest women in the world.'' Soviet diplomats called the release a `` goodwill gesture'' by the rebels, called mujahedeen or Islamic `` holy warriors, who for 11 years have fought to topple successive, Soviet-backed governments in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>. The diplomats refused to describe it as a prisoner exchange, but hinted that <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> was prepared to help lobby for the release of some rebel prisoners held by Afghan Communists. `` This is completely a humanitarian issue but if you are doing something good for the Russian people, something will happen,'' <PERSON> Andronov </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> claims about 310 of its men are unaccounted for in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. The rebels say they are holding no more than 75. The insurgents, backed primarily by <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, claim the <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> government is holding as many as 35,000 rebel prisoners, many in the notorious <LOCATION> Pul-i-Charki </LOCATION> prison complex outside the Afghan capital. The insurgents offered to release <LOCATION> Lopukh </LOCATION> when <PERSON> Andronov </PERSON> brought a delegation to the Pakistani frontier city of <LOCATION> Peshawar </LOCATION> in June. However, the former soldier told a news conference he would n't go home until <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> freed all rebel prisoners He said he had become a Moslem, and was unsure if he wanted to go home. Soviet forces fought to prop up <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s Marxists, who seized power in a 1978 coup, between December 1979 and February 1989. <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> continues massive military aid to <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>. Government forces still control the country's major cities, but the rebels have virtual free run of the countryside. The insurgents refuse to talk peace with <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> officials, whom they blame for inviting the Soviet intervention.

 A Moslem leader in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> said today he plans a lecture tour of the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, including <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, in a campaign to persuade that nation's leaders to revoke their death threat against author <PERSON> Salman </PERSON> <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>. `` A price on his head is below the dignity of the Iranian government _ it belongs to gangster movies and westerns,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Hesham </PERSON> <PERSON> El-Essawy </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> for the Promotion of Religious Tolerance. He said he plans to speak at universities and to the media in <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> states in February. If the Iranian government guarantees his safety, he said he will visit there as well. <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>'s novel `` The Satanic Verses'' has offended many Moslems worldwide who say it blasphemes Islam. On Feb. 14, <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Iranian </LOCATION> leader who died in June, told Moslems to kill the author. <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>'s threat was backed by the offer of a $ 5.2 million bounty by two Iranian Moslem clergymen. The 42-year-old writer, an Indian-born Briton, remains in hiding. <PERSON> El-Essawy </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> dentist, said he would cite the Koran, <ORGANIZATION> Islam </ORGANIZATION>'s holy book, to support his arguments that the death threat should be lifted. `` The Koran has verses that actually fit the situation exactly: If unbelievers or hypocrites mock or insult the word of God, do not sit with them until they talk about something else,'' he said. `` The Koran's position is very tolerant but <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> said ` Kill him,''' <PERSON> El-Essawy </PERSON> said. `` I am just as incensed by Mr. <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>'s book as anybody else, but my reaction has to come within the confines and teachings of the Koran I am hoping that people will come to their senses and the pressure will ease.'' The <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> newspaper The Independent today quoted <PERSON> El-Essawy </PERSON> as saying the <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> affair had harmed <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s 2 million Moslems by encouraging a backlash against them. On March 17, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> broke diplomatic ties with <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> over the <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> affair.

 Severe drought in war-wracked northern <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION> may threaten as many as 4 million people with starvation, more than twice the number originally feared to be in danger, a <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> official said today. The new estimate was based on satellite pictures that revealed widespread crop failures in the northernmost provinces of <LOCATION> Eritrea </LOCATION>, Tigre and <LOCATION> Wollo </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Morton </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Program </ORGANIZATION> representative in <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION>. Up to 600,000 metric tons of relief food could be needed next year to avert widespread famine deaths like those suffered in the 1984-85 famine when up to 1 million people died, he said. The new figures are substantially higher than those released in October, when the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> appealed for 240,000 tons of food to feed 1.8 million people based on satellite photographs that indicated only <LOCATION> Eritrea </LOCATION>'s crops had been severely affected by failed rains. Only about 40 inches of rain fell this year _ half the normal amount. <PERSON> Morton </PERSON> said the response to the October appeal was `` good and fast'' and that 130,000 tons of food already had been pledged, but that now would satisfy only about one-fifth of northern <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION>'s needs About half the people threatened by starvation live behind rebel lines, and <PERSON> Morton </PERSON> would not comment on how relief agencies would get the emergency food aid to them. It also was unknown whether <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION>'s Marxist government would allow shipments of international aid from its seaports into rebel-held areas. On Thursday, Ethiopian and Eritrean rebel peace negotiators sat down to a traditional American Thanksgiving dinner with former President <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> and his wife in <LOCATION> Nairobi </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 East German leader <PERSON> Egon </PERSON> <PERSON> Krenz </PERSON> said in an interview published today that he favors abolishing the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s constitutional claim to total power, making yet another concession to the pro-democracy movement. But while explicitly advocating the removal of the constitutional provision guaranteeing the party a monopoly on power, he made it clear he expects the party to remain a leading force. In other developments today, West German officials reported a sharp rise in East German requests for permanent resettlement there. In the past 24 hours, 2,000 such requests were received, compared to 865 in the 24-hour period before that, they said. Leaders of the government-run labor union requested an investigation of <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Tisch </PERSON>, an ousted Politburo member and the former government labor chief, whom they accused of abuse of power. On Thursday, the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> announced it had opened a probe of ousted leader <PERSON> Erich </PERSON> <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON>. <PERSON> Krenz </PERSON>, a former <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON> disciple now trying to distance himself from his old mentor, said in a television interview Thursday that he would step down if the party asked to leave during a party congress next month. The party Thursday also revoked the membership of <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON>'s former economic czar, who was thrown out of the ruling Politburo in the purge last month that launched a wave of reform and opened up the <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> Wall The moves reflected the party's desperate attempts to restore its sinking credibility and authority. Meanwhile, pro-democracy demonstrations continued with about 10,000 protesters rallying in the city of <LOCATION> Erfurt </LOCATION> on Thursday night, said <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> ADN </ORGANIZATION> news agency. In an interview published today by the Communist party daily <ORGANIZATION> Neues </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deutschland </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Krenz </ORGANIZATION> called for major constitutional changes to separate the party, state and economy. Asked by the interviewer about the country's deep political crisis, <ORGANIZATION> Krenz </ORGANIZATION> mentioned the constitutional provision guaranteeing Communist authority and said, `` We are in favor of abolishing it.'' That is one of protesters' main demands. But when asked about demands by pro-democracy demonstrators for curbing party `` interference'' in all aspects of life, <ORGANIZATION> Krenz </ORGANIZATION> replied: `` One has to say very clearly that we will interfere with all our energy. Not least because we represent a considerable part of the population, particularly the working class.'' He added, `` We are not a corrupt party.'' <ORGANIZATION> Krenz </ORGANIZATION> said hard-line policies of the past decades caused `` many basic mistakes, ultimately the crisis of our society.'' The disciplinary investigation against the ailing <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON>; former economy czar <PERSON> Guenter </PERSON> <PERSON> Mittag </PERSON>; and two other former officials was based on `` grave abuses'' of the party statute and `` responsibility for the current situation in the party and the country,'' <ORGANIZATION> ADN </ORGANIZATION> said without elaborating Thursday. ADN also said that <PERSON> Mittag </PERSON> was expelled from the party. The party's probe of <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON> and other former senior officials could result in various sanctions ranging from an official rebuke to expulsion from the party. <ORGANIZATION> Krenz </ORGANIZATION> replaced <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON> on Oct. 18. <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON> led the country for 18 years, staunchly resisting the kind of reforms launched by Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> nearly five years ago. <ORGANIZATION> Krenz </ORGANIZATION> has embraced a program of reforms and concessions to opposition demands, including the long-denied freedom to travel, the promise of free elections, and sweeping changes in the economy. But the dramatic changes have failed to shore up the party's standing and <ORGANIZATION> Krenz </ORGANIZATION>'s own credibility among the citizenry, which has staged massive demonstrations to press demands for more democracy <ORGANIZATION> Krenz </ORGANIZATION>, 52, long viewed as a hard-liner, said in an interview with <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> ARD </ORGANIZATION> television network Thursday that he had been `` inspired by the new thinking of <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>.'' He said 1985, when <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> came to power, was `` decisive'' for him. <ORGANIZATION> Krenz </ORGANIZATION> also said he had talked several times to <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON> by telephone and that the former leader `` accepts that he is largely responsible for this situation.'' That was a reference to the political and economic crisis that led nearly 300,000 East Germans to leave the country this year and sparked massive pro-democracy demonstrations nationwide. East German officials already have said a parliamentary commission was looking into charges of misuse of power and corruption against <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON> and his inner circle. <ORGANIZATION> ADN </ORGANIZATION> said doctors had decided that <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON> was too ill to make any statements in the proceedings. The 77-year-old former leader has had severe medical problems since a gall bladder operation earlier this year. <ORGANIZATION> Krenz </ORGANIZATION> said he had n't taken over as leader for a short-term period but emphasized that a decision on his fate was up to next month's special party congress, and that he would step down if asked. Earlier, <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> announced a package of measures aimed at stopping the massive smuggling of currency and consumer goods out of the troubled nation. Since East <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> lifted travel restrictions on Nov. 9, the Communist government has been wrestling with a growing black market and smuggling on a scale not seen since before the Berlin Wall was built in 1961.

 Three shots were fired today at a polling booth where opposition leader <PERSON> Vishwanath </PERSON> <PERSON> Pratap </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> had gone to investigate reports of election fraud, <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> and witnesses said.

It was obvious that the target of the gunmen was <PERSON> Raja </PERSON> <PERSON> Sahib </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> is often called `` <PERSON> Raja </PERSON> <PERSON> Sahib </PERSON>,'' which means `` King Sir.'' Shots rang out as <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> got out of his car in the village of <LOCATION> Dubrai </LOCATION>, in <LOCATION> Uttar </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pradesh </LOCATION> state, where he had gone to investigate reports that workers from Prime Minister <PERSON> Rajiv </PERSON> <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> were rigging polls. The witness, who is not affiliated with <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>'s opposition coalition, said the gunfire began as <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> was surrounded by a crowd of people who had alleged the ballot-fixing. The witness spoke on condition of anonymity. Another person at the scene also reported the shooting but said he could not tell if the shots were aimed at Singh. <PERSON> Anand </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharma </PERSON>, chief spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, was asked in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION> about the shooting. He replied that opposition supporters were `` responsible for all the violence'' in the area. Today was the second of three days of voting in a parliamentary election, in which <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> faces the most determined challenge ever mounted by the country's usually splintered opposition. <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Janata </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> have traded charges of widespread fraud and intimidation, and election-related violence has killed at least 106 people. The <ORGANIZATION> Election </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> said today it has ordered a revote at 930 of the country's 590,000 voting booths following fraud reports. In comments earlier today, 58-year-old <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> said, `` The <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> is bent upon creating trouble here, but I am not going to allow that.'' In his wake, villagers armed with batons and spears screamed `` Death to the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>!'' and vowed to protect voters from troublemakers. <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> headed to <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION> state, which votes Sunday, for a last campaign swing. At a rally in <LOCATION> Bhatinda </LOCATION>, he accused neighboring <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> of arming and training Sikh separatists, who have killed about 1,640 people this year in their fight for a separate nation in <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> has denied such allegations. In the first hours of voting today, clashes between <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Janata </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dal </ORGANIZATION> supporters were reported in <LOCATION> Calcutta </LOCATION> and eastern <LOCATION> Orissa </LOCATION> state, but there were no immediate reports of deaths. A total of 106 people have been killed in campaign-related violence since Oct. 17, when elections were announced. Since voting began Wednesday, 62 people have died. At stake in the elections are 524 of the 543 seats in the <LOCATION> Lok </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sabha </LOCATION>, or House of the People, <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>'s policy-making lower house. No results will be announced until after the last polls close Sunday. Few real issues were at stake in the campaign, apart from <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> himself, who has been dogged for half of his five-year term by allegations of corruption in high government circles. The National Front, an opposition coalition spearheaded by <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Janata </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dal </ORGANIZATION> party, has promised to provide clean government. But <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> told voters the only party capable of governing is his <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, whose most famous leaders were his grandfather and mother, Prime Minister <PERSON> Jawaharlal </PERSON> <PERSON> Nehru </PERSON> and Prime Minister <PERSON> Indira </PERSON> <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>. <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> was swept into office on a wave of sympathy after his mother's assassination in 1984, winning 415 of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>'s 543 seats. However, recent polls indicated he could lose the election or be forced into an unwieldy coalition with smaller parties this time. The <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> has governed <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> for all but 29 months since the country became independent 42 years ago. Voting today was spread across 10 states and two federally governed territories, where a total of 264 million people were eligible to vote. The total number of eligible voters is 498 million. Most of the rest of <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s 25 states and seven territories voted Wednesday. On Sunday, voting will take place in three states. Elections for the 14 seats in northeastern <LOCATION> Assam </LOCATION> state have been postponed indefinitely because of incomplete voter rolls, and a few other contests were delayed because of candidates' deaths.

 Police and army units raided a drug traffickers' fortress and apparently came close to capturing the head of the notorious <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> cocaine cartel, police said today. The newspaper <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tiempo </ORGANIZATION> reported that the cartel leader, <PERSON> Pablo </PERSON> <PERSON> Escobar </PERSON>, fled into the jungle wearing only his pants. Officials did not confirm this. <PERSON> El </PERSON> <PERSON> Tiempo </PERSON> said two of <PERSON> Escobar </PERSON>'s bodyguards were killed and 55 people were arrested in the raid, which took place early Thursday. Hundreds of troops from government security forces blocked roads throughout the area, 70 miles west of <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION>, in an attempt to catch <PERSON> Escobar </PERSON>, <PERSON> El </PERSON> <PERSON> Tiempo </PERSON> said, and helicopters patrolled the area to prevent him from fleeing by air. Army troops and members of a special police anti-drug unit, not told where they were going, headed out in helicopters and raided the ranch in central <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Tiempo </LOCATION> and two other <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION> dailies, <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Espectador </LOCATION> and <PERSON> La </PERSON> <PERSON> Prensa </PERSON>, said. <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Tiempo </LOCATION>, quoting officers commanding units of the troops involved, said <PERSON> Escobar </PERSON>, who is wanted in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, ran into the jungle wearing only pants.

<DATELINE>GRAND RAPIDS, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s latest economic threat to <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> does n't roll off a production line _ it drops from a tree. The Fuji apple is described as sweeter, larger and longer-lasting than varieties grown in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, the nation's second-largest apple producer after <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> It's also more expensive and takes longer to grow, but apple growers say the Fuji may be the apple of tomorrow. `` In the future, flavor and crispness will be more important than red, shiny apples,'' said <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Kroph </PERSON>, a major grower-packer in the Grand Rapids area. `` We're in a world market now, and the Europeans have always chosen taste over looks.'' The Japanese variety is beginning to appear on supermarket shelves, and analysts predict a healthy market for the <ORGANIZATION> Fuji </ORGANIZATION>. `` It stays crisp and juicy in storage long after other apples have turned mushy,'' said <PERSON> Jerome </PERSON> <PERSON> Hull </PERSON>, a pomologist, or orchard scientist, at <ORGANIZATION> Michigan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. `` That means big supermarket orders.'' Growing the <ORGANIZATION> Fuji </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> would mean developing a new strain, <PERSON> Hull </PERSON> said. Its six - to seven-month growing season is two months longer than the state's season <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> growers are entering the apple market for the first time simply to grow the Fuji. Their counterparts in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, plan a major shift toward the <ORGANIZATION> Fuji </ORGANIZATION> after overproduction of Red Delicious depressed the value of the crop there. The new breed of apple does n't exactly spell disaster, <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> growers said. `` Chrysler survived. <ORGANIZATION> Honda </ORGANIZATION> just took a piece of the market,'' said <PERSON> Kroph </PERSON>. `` The Fuji will be just another variety, and it will be a long time coming. It takes 10 years to put a tree into production.'' <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> grows eight varieties of apples and produces more than 1 billion pounds a year. The Fuji sells for about 99 cents a pound in the <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> area, compared with 59 cents a pound for <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> Red Delicious apples.

 The Thanksgiving Eve opening of <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> J </PERSON>. <PERSON> Fox </PERSON>'s `` Back to the Future Part II'' took in $ 7 million in what <ORGANIZATION> Universal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pictures </ORGANIZATION> called the biggest-ever midweek box office gross. The sequel to 1985's mega-millions hit opened Wednesday on 1,866 screens nationwide and the first-day take was $ 7 million, said <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Sutton </PERSON>, a Universal spokesman. `` That was the biggest Wednesday box office gross ever in the motion picture business,'' he said. The previous box office champ on an opening Wednesday was `` Rocky 4'' in 1985 with a $ 5.7 million turnstile take. `` Batman,'' which opened on a Friday this year, holds the non-opening Wednesday record with $ 6.6 million. `` Back to the Future'' also opened over a five-day holiday period _ the extended Fourth of July weekend in 1985 _ and its five-day opening gross was $ 14.9 million. The film ended up doing $ 350 million worldwide. Universal will continue to capitalize on the popularity of <PERSON> Fox </PERSON>, whose role as conservative <PERSON> Alex </PERSON> <PERSON> Keaton </PERSON> on `` Family Ties'' endeared him to millions of television viewers.

<TEXT>
 Guards angered over the firing of a union leader have occupied all 24 provincial prisons and detention centers in <LOCATION> Quebec </LOCATION> and locked prisoners in their cells, a spokesman for the guards' union said today. City and provincial police surrounded some of the facilities and have threatened to go in and remove the guards, spokesman <PERSON> Pierre </PERSON> <PERSON> Valiquette </PERSON> said. Forty-five guards occupied the command center of <LOCATION> Parthenais </LOCATION> on Thursday after officials fired <PERSON> Pierre </PERSON> <PERSON> Gaummound </PERSON>, head of the union at <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION>'s Parthenais detention center, <PERSON> Valiquette </PERSON> said. Essential services, including food and medical services, will be provided, but until <PERSON> Gaummound </PERSON> is rehired, management staff will be kept out and prisoners will remain in their cells, <PERSON> Valiquette </PERSON> said. `` They tried to kill the union by cutting off its head,'' he said. Contract negoiations with the province's 1,500 guards broke down two months ago, <PERSON> Valiquette </PERSON> said, adding that the guards have been without a contract since January 1988. Eleven prisoners have been locked out of <LOCATION> Parthenais </LOCATION> and may have to be sent home, said one who identified himself only as a `` criminal.'' The prisoners left the prison on a work detail the previous night. `` We have n't had breakfast yet; tell the director they have n't fed us,'' one prisoner shouted from his second-floor window in the gray stone building, which was surrounded by police The provincial jails range in size from a couple of dozen prisoners to several hundred at centers such as <LOCATION> Parthenais </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Bordeaux </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION>. The prisoners are serving terms of two years or less. The provincial jails also hold prisoners awaiting court appearances. The main issues in negotiations are revised job descriptions, work hours and wages. The guards want changes to shift schedules. They now work seven days followed by three days off, and then seven days followed by four days off. Guards with five years' experience earn $ 31,836 a year. The government's latest offer would increase their salary to $ 37,900 in 1991.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Nicolae </PERSON> <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON>, who has staunchly opposed the democratic reforms sweeping the rest of <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, was re-elected to another five-year term today. The party's 467-member Central Committee unanimously chose <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON> _ the only candidate. Delegates to the 14th <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> greeted the selection with cries of `` <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON>, CPR!'' the abbreviation for the party. Delegates also approved an economic and social program `` for the next five years and beyond'' that would further strengthen the party's near-total control over the daily lives of Romanians. No details of the plan were given. <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON>, 71, also called for the annulment of the 1939 Soviet-Nazi <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> treaty that agreed to the partition of much of <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> among the powers, the official news agency <ORGANIZATION> Agerpres </ORGANIZATION> reported today. In talks with <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> delegations, he said the treaty should `` be considered wrong and officially annuled with all its provisions, including its secret provisions.'' One provision ceded the Romanian province of <LOCATION> Bessarabia </LOCATION> to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and gave <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> control over the three Baltic states. The talks elaborated on comments he made Monday, when he indirectly appeared to urge the return of <LOCATION> Bessarabia </LOCATION>, which is now <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Moldavia </LOCATION>. But he has made no specific demand to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> for the return of the territory. <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON> also proposed an international conference of Communist and socialist parties to discuss the `` many problems ... of socialist construction,'' Agerpres reported. As he spoke in the downtown Palace Hall, thousands of workers and youths gathered outside, shouting pro-Ceausescu slogans. State radio said 125,000 people turned out. It was not possible to confirm the figure independently. <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON>, the longest-serving party leader in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, has so far rejected reforms similar to those that have gripped other Soviet bloc countries and have most recently shaken <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>. His intolerance of any opposition had led to the most repressive atmosphere within the Soviet bloc even before the onset of changes elsewhere. His insistence on prompt repayment of a $ 23 billion foreign debt brought on a harsh austerity movement that caused shortages of food and many consumer goods. His government's program of razing ethnic Hungarian villages has led to his condemnation by human rights groups. However, the five-day party congress, which ends today, has been filled with speeches lauding his efforts and calling him `` a hero of the nation.'' Officials said earlier that the re-election of the man who has led <LOCATION> Rmania </LOCATION> since 1965 would be a formality because `` there is nobody foolish enough to oppose him.'' <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON> indicated that at his international conference, he would like to form an alliance of orthodox Communists to counterbalance the reform wave gripping all six other <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact nations. `` We must not necessarily wait until every party is ready to attend,'' <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON> was quoted as saying. `` The parties that wish to meet and discuss the problems of strengthening their solidarity and collaboration in the fight against imperialism ... must meet.'' <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON> said the annulment of the 1939 Nazi-Soviet pact `` should be done for the past and present and for the future alike.'' He said it was `` important as a lesson for the present and the future.'' `` The world issues, including the nuclear issues, can not be settled by the two powers alone,'' he said. He also warned the world to `` beware today, too, of a possible new accord between the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> to the detriment of other peoples.''

 Motorists who thought they were unlucky when they locked their keys in their cars just saw their luck take a turn for the worse.

 Dissident <PERSON> Vaclav </PERSON> <PERSON> Havel </PERSON> today accepted the Olof Palme human rights award and said his Communist country was the last in central <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> to rise up to demand democratic changes. The 53-year-old playwright, whose works have been banned by Communist authorities at home but produced to acclaim internationally, received the $ 15,500 award from Swedish Foreign Minister <PERSON> Sten </PERSON> <PERSON> Andersson </PERSON> in a ceremony at the Swedish Embassy. The award follows a week of unprecedented protest in <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> as hundreds of thousands of people have taken to the streets to demand the resignation of the nation's hard-line Communist leadership. In a brief speech, <PERSON> Havel </PERSON> said his nation was `` the last country to wake up'' in central <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. `` We are de facto an occupied country,'' <PERSON> Havel </PERSON> said, apparently referring to the Soviet troops who stayed in <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> after leading a 1968 <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact invasion that crushed the `` Prague Spring'' reform movement. He appealed for international support for the current burgeoning pro-democracy movement. <PERSON> Havel </PERSON>, a member of the Charter 77 human rights group who has served three years in jail since 1979 for his criticism of the nation's <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> leaders, canceled earlier plans to travel to <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION> to receive the award because of the upheaval in <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>.

 A former security policemen said a police major in the anti-terrorist unit was involved in killing anti-apartheid activists, a newspaper reported today. He was the second former officer to make the allegation. Also today, a newspaper said the police major, <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Kock </PERSON>, has been called to testify at two inquests involving the deaths of eight activists. Law and Order Minister <PERSON> Adriaan </PERSON> <PERSON> Vlok </PERSON> suggested today that the allegation of the death squad is part of a plot by black militants to discredit the police. Butana Nofomela and <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Tshikalange </PERSON>, who have said they were members of a police death squad, alleged that <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Kock </PERSON> commanded the squad from 1983 and was linked to the killings of activists. `` The name of Maj. <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Kock </PERSON> has increasingly emerged as the new leader of the police's alleged murder gang,'' said Free Weekly, an anti-apartheid Afrikaans-language newspaper. Free Weekly today quoted <PERSON> Tshikalange </PERSON> as saying <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Kock </PERSON> was the field commander of the death squad. <PERSON> Tshikalange </PERSON> said that in 1983 he saw the body of a slain man, wrapped in plastic and with blood on the head, in the trunk of de Kock's car. Nofomela, who is on Death Row for a killing unrelated to the alleged death squad activities, said in an affidavit made public earlier that he saw de Kock shoot security guard <PERSON> Japie </PERSON> <PERSON> Moponye </PERSON> in the head in 1985. <PERSON> Moponye </PERSON> was the brother of a suspected <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> guerrilla. Nofomela, <PERSON> Tshikalange </PERSON>, and a third ex-policeman, former Capt. <PERSON> Dirk </PERSON> <PERSON> Coetzee </PERSON>, have admitted taking part in numerous killings of anti-apartheid activists in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and in neighboring countries. <PERSON> Coetzee </PERSON> said he headed an anti-terrorist unit that he said acted as a death squad until 1982. <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Kock </PERSON> took over the same anti-terrorist unit in 1983, Free Weekly and Weekly Mail reported today. <PERSON> Tshikalange </PERSON> and <PERSON> Coetzee </PERSON> have fled <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. Nofomela has been granted a stay of execution while the allegations are investigated. Police have denied the existence of an authorized death squad but say it is possible that renegade officers killed government opponents on their own. President F.W. <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON> has not commented on the case and is not expected to do so until he reviews a report by <PERSON> Vlok </PERSON>. <PERSON> Vlok </PERSON> said the African National Congress and the South African <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, both outlawed, are attempting to `` break down the morale of the police'' with the allegations. `` They have lost -LRB- their military campaigns -RRB- but their goal has not changed,'' <PERSON> Vlok </PERSON> said. `` They must get the police and the security forces out of their way to make it easier to bring about their aim of creating a communist state.'' The Weekly Mail said <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Kock </PERSON> has been called to testify in two inquests involving eight deaths. In one incident, four black men were killed near <LOCATION> Durban </LOCATION> in 1986. Nofomela has said he was present and that <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Kock </PERSON> was the officer in charge. In the second incident, four blacks were killed in a shooting near the South Africa-Swaziland border last year.

 Police today found a time bomb in luggage taken from a <ORGANIZATION> Saudi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> jumbo jet, and only a loose wire stopped it from exploding over the <LOCATION> Arabian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> with 248 people aboard, officials said. `` We have recovered a bomb in a bag which was not tagged,'' said an officer of the paramilitary <ORGANIZATION> Karachi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>, who identified himself only as <PERSON> Ashraf </PERSON>. A security force commander who spoke on condition of anonymity said the bomb would have destroyed the terminal of <LOCATION> Karachi </LOCATION>'s airport in addition to the plane had it gone off after the jet landed Only a loose battery wire prevented it from blowing up Thursday night as the plane flew from <LOCATION> Islamabad </LOCATION> to the <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> city of <LOCATION> Riyadh </LOCATION>, said the commander. The officials said they questioned all passengers and crew members but had not made any arrests. They refused to say if they had any suspects or whether any group claimed responsibility. A taxi driver delivered an envelope to an <LOCATION> Islamabad </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> security officer soon after Saudi flight 367 departed for <LOCATION> Riyadh </LOCATION> at about 6 p.m. Thursday, security force officials said. It contained a note threatening to destroy the plane unless authorities paid $ 1.5 million, they said. The jet was over the sea when the <LOCATION> Karachi </LOCATION> control tower relayed the threat and called it back to land. After the airliner was emptied of passengers and luggage, officers found an unclaimed school bag containing the explosive device. It was set to go off at 7:20 p.m., when the aircraft was over the water. Asked how someone could have smuggled the bomb past <LOCATION> Islamabad </LOCATION> airport security, Col. <PERSON> Noor </PERSON> <PERSON> Khan </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> Islamabad </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> said: `` It's not understood how they did it. Everything is there and working,'' in a reference to airport security devices. Travelers embarking on international flights from <LOCATION> Islamabad </LOCATION> normally have their baggage inspected manually by customs agents and then screened by X-ray. Passengers with boarding cards then pass through a metal detector, receive a body search, and their carry-on luggage is X-rayed a second time. Law enforcement specialists were examining the aircraft today, and a joint investigation was under way in <LOCATION> Islamabad </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Karachi </LOCATION>, sources said. A terrorist bomb exploded in December aboard a <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 747 over <LOCATION> Lockerbie </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>, killing 270 people. Investigators later said the bomb was hidden in a cassette-recorder.

 After a day at home to ponder their blessings, Americans piled into shopping malls today as the traditional kickoff of the Christmas shopping season got under way. `` We're off to a good start,'' said <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Lynne </PERSON> <PERSON> LaRochelle </PERSON>, manager of <PERSON> Levinsky </PERSON>'s discount clothing store in <LOCATION> Freeport </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, which opened to waiting customers at 7 a.m. `` Our sales are up from last year.'' Strong sales were reported elsewhere as well. At the <LOCATION> Acadiana </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mall </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Lafayette </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> La. </LOCATION>, spokeswoman <PERSON> Sherry </PERSON> <PERSON> Bouttee </PERSON> said the parking lot was filling up rapidly by midmorning and some shoppers probably would have to park in nearby fields. Animal rights activists planned nationwide protests against fur sales. In <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, workers at <ORGANIZATION> Grove </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cleaners </ORGANIZATION> and Furriers arrived today to find red and blue paint covering the front windows and graffiti on a van parked out front. A spokeswoman for the <ORGANIZATION> Animals </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> denied responsibility for the vandalism. Today's shopping spree followed a white Thanksgiving for many people in the East and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION>. The holiday was an occasion for the needy to count life's few blessings in homeless shelters and soup kitchens around the nation. Giving thanks was on the minds of thousands of victims of Hurricane Hugo, northern <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s earthquake and other natural disasters that jolted the nation this year. `` We are alive. We have more reasons to give thanks than we do to be sorry,'' said <PERSON> Mabel </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>, owner of a trailer park in <LOCATION> Alorton </LOCATION> in southern <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> that was devastated by a Nov. 15 storm that caused an estimated $ 5.3 million in damage. The snow that fell from <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> canceled high school football games in the <LOCATION> Northeast </LOCATION>, but neither a wascally wabbit who would n't waft nor a fallen Humpty Dumpty dampened the spirits of millions of parade watchers. `` This is the snowiest Thanksgiving. Period,'' said meteorologist <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Woodworth </PERSON> at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, where more than 5 inches of snow fell. Up to 8 inches of snow fell in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, and 5 inches was reported at Snowshoe ski resort near <LOCATION> Marlinton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> W. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION> residents woke up to their first white Thanksgiving since The first Thanksgiving snow in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> since 1938 grounded the Snoopy and Bugs Bunny balloons from the 63rd Annual Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade, but an estimated 1.8 million people still lined the parade route `` I would have come out here even if it was 20 degrees below freezing. It's a million times better live,'' said 32-year-olt <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Koleba </PERSON>, wrapped in an army jacket, two hats and a scarf. The 70th annual Thanksgiving Day parade in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> survived a record snowfall, but the 55-foot Humpty Dumpty balloon had a great fall when it was punctured by a light standard. Some 900,000 people braved temperatures in the 20s Thursday in <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> to watch the 63rd Annual Michigan Thanksgiving Day Parade. In an out-of-this-world meal, Discovery's astronauts celebrated in space with thermo-stabilized turkey, freeze-dried vegetables and cranberry sauce. <PERSON> Jyso </PERSON>???? O?? @? wife enjoyed a traditional Thanksgiving dinner that included roast turkey with stuffing and cranberry sauce, sweet potatoes topped with marshmallows, green beans, salad and pumpkin and pecan pies at the retreat in Camp David, Md. Meanwhile, at a holiday feast at the <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rescue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mission </ORGANIZATION>, actor <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Vereen </PERSON> asked the president to do more for the homeless. `` I will not pray for you,'' he told the mission diners. `` I will pray for the administration to do something for you.'' A laid-off bank president was among those served at a <ORGANIZATION> Salvation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> center in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, but it was the children who were among the victims of the state's slumping economy that most touched the hearts of volunteers. `` They often wonder why they are going to this strange place, but when they're eating good food there is a real warm feeling for the whole family to see,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Salvation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Copaccio </PERSON>. A man in <LOCATION> Woonsocket </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> R.I. </LOCATION>, helped the needy revel in the kindness of others after his ministry received 458 donated turkeys. Last week <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Dempster </PERSON>, director of Because He Lives Ministries, had only three turkeys and a guest list of about 70 people. He called friends, newspapers and radio stations looking for more. `` I told them I needed help getting the word out,'' said <PERSON> Dempster </PERSON>. By Thursday morning he was inundated with 458 turkeys, he said. In the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> area, many survivors of the Oct. 17 quake gave thanks by serving holdiay meals to their less fortunate neighbors. `` Here we can really give thanks and be grateful that we are still here despite the destruction and death; this is a time when we can come together.'' said the Rev. <PERSON> Cecil </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Glide </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Memorial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Methodist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>, where 6,000 people were treated to dinner. A killer tornado did not stop an <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> couple from having their planned Thanksgiving wedding. <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Stinson </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Huntsville </LOCATION> said his wedding vows to <PERSON> Wanda </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> from a hospital bed, where he was recovering from storm injuries. `` y? hd be an e -RCB- date to remember,'' he said. Three people rescued from a raft on 18-foot seas near <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION>, were thankful to be alive as they ate Thanksgiving Day dinner at the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Station </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION>, Ga. The trio were tired but in good health after abandoning their floundering 43-foot boat and drifting in a raft for four hours Thursday about 35 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION>, officials said. Elsewhere, the chiefs of <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>'s eight Indian tribes were the guests of Gov. and Mrs. <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baliles </PERSON> at a Thanksgiving feast in <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION>. `` A lot of Indians in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> have probably wanted to do something like this.

 A drug suspect and a sheriff's deputy grappled with a knife during a harrowing two-mile ride in the suspect's car, authorities said. Neither the suspect nor the deputy was seriously injured in the fracas, which occurred about 65 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. However, the suspect was hurt later when he lost control of his car and crashed, according to a <LOCATION> Riverside </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> sheriff's spokesman, Sgt. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Domino </PERSON>. <PERSON> Domino </PERSON> said the incident began Thursday afternoon when the deputy, who was not identified, stopped a 1990 <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mustang </ORGANIZATION> and discovered an undisclosed amount of methamphetamines inside. A struggle ensued and the driver, <PERSON> Ruben </PERSON> <PERSON> Danny </PERSON> <PERSON> Correa </PERSON>, 22, of <LOCATION> Whittier </LOCATION>, allegedly started the car and drove off with the deputy inside. Domino said <PERSON> Correa </PERSON> tried to stab the deputy, but the officer wrested control of the knife. After two miles, the deputy got out of the car and <PERSON> Correa </PERSON> drove off. The officer was only slightly injured in the struggle. <PERSON> Correa </PERSON> lost control of his car about two hours later in the <LOCATION> Rancho </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> area, about 20 miles from the spot where he had been pulled over by the deputy, <PERSON> Domino </PERSON> said.

 A federal judge today threw out the Iran-Contra prosecutor's criminal case against a former <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> station chief who assisted <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s secret Contra resupply operation. <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Hilton </PERSON> dismissed the case against <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON>, saying that Attorney General <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON>'s affidavit barring disclosure of certain classified information made it impossible to give <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON> a fair trial. The office of independent counsel <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> said it would appeal. The judge said that the information <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> is blocking concerning <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> facilities and programs in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> is essential for <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON> `` to receive a fair trial.'' Because of this, said the judge, `` the case will be dismissed.'' <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON>, the former <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> station chief in <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION>, was charged with obstructing inquiries into the Iran-Contra affair by the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> inspector general and the presidentially appointed <ORGANIZATION> Tower </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON> also was charged with two counts of making false statements in connection with his activities on behalf of <LOCATION> North </LOCATION>'s network to arm the Nicaraguan rebels at a time when <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> had banned military aid to the Contras `` We are troubled by the actions of the intelligence agencies and the attorney general, who have made bringing this case to trial extremely difficult,'' associate independent counsel <PERSON> Laurence </PERSON> <PERSON> Shtasel </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Hilton </PERSON> ruled last July that <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON> must be able to disclose at trial details about the locations of <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> stations in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>, as well as details about <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> programs in <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION>. `` This is a significant Iran-Contra prosecution,'' <PERSON> Shtasel </PERSON> said. `` We will now appeal Judge <PERSON> Hilton </PERSON>'s rulings ... making every effort to bring the <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON> case to trial.'' Outside the courthouse, <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON> said he was relieved that the `` freight train -LRB- prosecution -RRB- of the independent counsel'' is now blocked. `` What troubles me'' about the independent counsel's case is that `` the performance of legitimate duties'' by <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> officers `` could subject them to criminal prosecution,'' said <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON>. He was asked whether he and his attorney, <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, had engaged in graymail, the practice of trying to inject as much classified information as possible into a prosecution in order to torpedo the case. `` That is an onerous and unnecessary comment,'' replied <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON>. The former <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> station chief said he needed to present such information in order to mount `` an adequate defense.'' <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> told the judge that the information <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> was barring from disclosure `` is the guts of the defense's case.'' In court, <PERSON> Shtasel </PERSON> asked the judge to give the government until next week to propose narrowing the charges against <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON> so that the classified information at stake in the case would not have to be presented. The attorney general filed an affidavit on Wednesday barring disclosure of the secrets and <PERSON> Shtasel </PERSON> said discussions have been underway with the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> since then in an attempt to balance the national security concerns while preserving some of the criminal charges. But <PERSON> Hilton </PERSON> refused to give the government more time, noting that his rulings on what information <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON> needs to use were issued four months ago. This is the first time that an attorney general has filed an affidavit barring disclosure of classified information in a criminal case and that a judge has dismissed the charges because of it. <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> said that <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> should have filed his affidavit last July following <ORGANIZATION> Hilton </ORGANIZATION>'s rulings. If that had been, said <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON>, `` a proper appeal would have already been decided and the trial would have been concluded. The independent counsel's office has called much of the classified information that the government is protecting in the <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON> case `` fictional secrets'' that are already widely known to the public.

 Discovery's crew worked through the second full day of the shuttle's secret military space mission Friday as officials on the ground kept a tight lid on what the five astronauts were doing. They reportedly were conducting experiments for the `` Star Wars'' missile defense system and other military projects. But there was no official word from <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> or the Pentagon. The media was blocked from listening to space-to-ground conversations, and communications between the astronauts and ground controllers were encrypted in case someone figured out how to eavesdrop. Mission Control in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> broke the silence Thursday night to report that Discovery would return to Earth on Sunday, landing at 7:02 p.m. PST at <ORGANIZATION> Edwards </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Calif </LOCATION>. It will be the third after-dark landing in 32 shuttle flights. The statement also reported, `` The crew is doing well and the orbiter continues to perform satisfactorily.'' Earlier, sources close to the project said the astronauts had achieved the main goal of their mission by deploying a 2 -LCB- - ton, $ 300 million satellite capable of monitoring military and diplomatic communications in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> There was no confirmation from the space agency or the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> on the release of the satellite. This is the fifth shuttle mission dedicated solely to military research. The silence contrasts sharply with a non-military shuttle flight during which the public can listen around-the-clock to communications between the spacecraft and <ORGANIZATION> Mission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> broadcasts a running commentary on activities. Commanding Discovery's crew is <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> Col. <PERSON> Frederick </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON>.

 The <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>' refugee agency Friday called on <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> to investigate allegations that undue force was used when moving Vietnamese boat people between detention centers. The office of the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> High Commissioner for Refugees has protested the circumstances surrounding the Oct. 31 move of 48 Vietnamese, who are among the tens of thousands of boat people seeking asylum in the British colony.

The government denies that undue force was used. More than 50,000 Vietnamese who fled to <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> by boat are languishing in squalid camps throughout the territory. Most must prove they fled political persecution to qualify for refugee status or face mandatory repatriation. Tens of thousands of Vietnamese are expected to be denied refugee status.

<TEXT>
 In the past week, tens of thousands of dedicated students have written a new chapter in the 650-year-old history of Wenceslas Square. The vast expanse in the center of <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> has been the scene of medieval markets, colorful pageantry under Austrian imperial rule, and religious ceremonies honoring <LOCATION> Bohemia </LOCATION>'s patron saint, <PERSON> Prince </PERSON> <PERSON> Wenceslas </PERSON>, murdered by heathen rebels more than a millennium ago. Wehrmacht soldiers lined it after the 1939 Nazi takeover, workers rallied on it in support of the Communist putsch in 1948, and in 1968 Soviet T-34 tanks parked on it following the Moscow-led invasion that put a bitter end to the `` Prague Spring'' reform movement of <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Dubcek </PERSON>, who was then ousted. Hundreds of students then used their knowledge of Russian for nightly discussions with the tank crews, leaving them so demoralized that some units had to be replaced. Official tourist guides make no mention of those days on the square, nor do they include any reference to young <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Palach </PERSON>, who burned himself on the square to protest the end of `` socialism with a human face.'' After his death, hundreds of candles were set in front of the statue of St. Wenceslas in the upper half of the 2,500-foot-long, 200-foot wide square. <PERSON> Palach </PERSON> has become a symbol of freedom and Czechoslovak independence. On Friday, the square was the scene of <PERSON> Dubcek </PERSON>'s triumphant return to <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION>, where he told 250,000 anti-government protesters that `` the ideal of socialism with a human face is living in the conditions of a new generation.'' The square _ the social, cultural and shopping center of the city _ is lined by shops, hotels, office and newspaper buildings, most of them built in the late 19th century. It was known as the Horse Market until 1848 because of its early importance as a site for horse-trading. The upper end of the square is dominated by the National Museum. In addition to the statue of <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Wenceslas </LOCATION> on horseback, the square has statues of four other patron saints of <LOCATION> Bohemia </LOCATION>: <PERSON> Ludmilla </PERSON>, Procopius, <PERSON> Agnes </PERSON> and <PERSON> Adalbert </PERSON>. Hundreds of candles also have reappeared in the square since Nov. 17, when a peaceful rally in memory of a young student killed by the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION> 50 years ago was dispersed by baton-wielding police. It was that brutal repression that triggered the nationwide pro-democracy demonstrations. `` It was the drop that made the keg filled to the brim with discontent spill over,'' a non-Communist <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> politician said. The rally gave life to a protest movement that took less than 72 hours to spread through the nation.

 Two brothers were executed and a third was sentenced to life in prison for kidnapping and selling 51 women, it was reported Friday. <PERSON> Wang </PERSON> <PERSON> Zhong </PERSON> and <PERSON> Wang </PERSON> <PERSON> Hong </PERSON> were executed Nov. 10 after being convicted in the northern province of <LOCATION> Shanxi </LOCATION> of abducting women in other provinces, the newspaper Legal Daily said. Two men in southwest <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Sichuan </LOCATION> province were put to death in September for heading a ring that kidnapped and sold 24 women, including 22 who suffered mental disorders. The government, in its latest anti-crime campaign, has listed the kidnapping of women and children as one of the `` six evils'' to be combatted. The others are prostitution, pornography, drugs, gambling and swindling people through superstition. The Legal Daily said kidnap gangs of up to 100 members are operating in every Chinese province, with 90 percent of their victims being peasant girls. The measures used to entice women include offers of jobs, marriage and free travel. `` They use sweet words and talk of love to seduce young women, and then kidnap and sell them. They kidnap women who are dull-witted and suffer from nervous disorders. They use violence to kidnap and sell women,'' the newspaper said. Many women are resold several times and raped, it said. In some places, mostly remote rural regions, where women are bought, `` the evil phenomenon of the taking of concubines and polygamy occurs.'' An earlier report said that in coastal <LOCATION> Shandong </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s third-most populous province, more than 3,000 people have been imprisoned in recent years for abducting and selling 30,000 women and 1,000 children

 For Maros, a teacher in this southern city, breaking the habits of 24 years of fear does not come easily. He is thrilled with <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>'s democracy movement. But like many people who have endured decades of hard-line Communist rule, he knows he has a lot to lose. `` I want to be open and say what I feel. But it's not easy. There's still something in me that says, ` Maybe he'll give some information to the secret police,''' says the young teacher, jerking his chin at an imaginary informer. Sitting in a cafe sipping coffee, he explained in halting English that he risks losing not only his job but the precious, limited freedom he has carved out as a <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION>. He asked his surname not be used for fear of reprisal. <PERSON> Maros </PERSON> was at a friend's mountain cottage last weekend when students in <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> launched <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>'s first big anti-government protests in years. They heard about it on the <ORGANIZATION> Voice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government-funded radio station that broadcasts into Eastern <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. `` I have n't had such a feeling in my life,'' said the short-haired teacher, clad in a blue plaid shirt, a gray sweatshirt and carefully pressed blue jeans. `` In 1968, when such demonstrations were allowed, I was 3 years old. It's something new.'' When he returned Monday to school in <LOCATION> Bratislava </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>'s second-largest city, `` the situation was in motion, also here.'' And he faced a difficult choice: should he join? A key dilemma was whether to risk exposing himself as an opponent of the Communist government, thereby jeopardizing the secret meetings he had been organizing for years to teach children about Catholicism. `` For 40 years children have grown up only in atheism. I think it's a basic right of mothers and fathers to raise children as they want,'' he said, describing with enthusiasm his lessons and field trips with the children. `` On the one hand, the -LRB- political -RRB- situation is not good, but I can do something secretly,'' he said. `` Or I could express my opinion in work and risk that they have written my name down somewhere and I will not be able to do this.'' A similar dilemma arose for Maros in March 1988, when 2,000 Catholics demonstrated for religious freedom in <LOCATION> Bratislava </LOCATION>. Riot police using water cannon broke up the protest and arrested 125 people. `` When there was this candlelight demonstration, there was a great fight in the family, especially with Father. He did n't want us to go because young people are willing to do such risky actions. He said, ` Do we keep our church alive for 40 years then risk it, just to hold a candle?''' `` I was in my last year of university studies. They -LRB- officials -RRB- said if students went they would be thrown out of school. If I would be sent out, my parents would suffer and so would my work.'' <PERSON> Maros </PERSON> decided not to go, but his two younger brothers did. `` I felt terrible. I went to an alternative place ... to pray, to be in contact through prayer. When we heard the sirens _ ` whee, whee, whee' _ I knew my brothers were there for what we want _ freedom, our rights _ and I was n't. `` I felt I had to run there and be beat up too.'' New protests broke out in <LOCATION> Bratislava </LOCATION> on Monday, inspired by the mass rallies in <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> calling for democracy and a new government. The next day, religious activists called for a demonstration Wednesday outside a court in <LOCATION> Bratislava </LOCATION> where a <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> dissident was being tried on political charges. `` I was n't initially sure about going. I have a job,'' <PERSON> Maros </PERSON> said. But on Tuesday, <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>'s primate, Cardinal <PERSON> Frantisek </PERSON> <PERSON> Tomasek </PERSON>, added his voice to the chorus demanding democracy, saying: `` At this decisive moment, no one must stand aside.'' <PERSON> Maros </PERSON> left a note on his door at school Wednesday morning, saying he would be back shortly. He did n't return. Sitting in the cafe Wednesday before attending <LOCATION> Bratislava </LOCATION>'s second protest rally of the day, he talked of the years he had steeled himself to accepting only a little freedom in his life: the secret meetings in which he taught children about God `` Can you imagine you can not phone a friend and say we will meet tonight or tomorrow in the church? I am very afraid to phone somebody that we will have a religious meeting and give an address _ that is unthinkable. `` This is what is deep in us: such fear. ... We want this freedom but we must learn it. It's deep in us, but we are n't yet used to such a situation.''

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> says the changes in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> raise the possibility of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troop reductions abroad but said no such cuts were imminent and none would be made unilaterally. `` There's a rapidity of change around the world, it's self evident,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said in an interview with foreign journalists Tuesday, a transcript of which was released by the White House today. `` And I'm not suggesting that forevermore we'll have the same levels of troops anywhere _ standing army, <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, anywhere else,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` But we're certainly not going to take any unilateral action.'' The president responded `` No, not a bit'' when asked whether he feared the changes in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> would strip the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> of its <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> leadership role. `` If tensions got so reduced that you did n't always worry about U.S.-superpower confrontation or something, that would be a marvelous world,'' he said. `` We ought to work toward that kind of world. But it's got to be on our values. It's got to be on what we in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> think is best _ know is best.'' Also today, the White House announced that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> would meet with President <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> of <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> on Dec. 16 in the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION>, to discuss his meeting next week with Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and a number of other issues. French officials said the two leaders would meet on the island of <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Martin </LOCATION>. In the interview with the foreign journalists, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> tried anew to dampen expectations for the meeting with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, and attributed his being labeled `` timid'' by some in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to `` pure gut American politics.'' As for possible troop cuts, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said the administration was `` perfectly prepared to think anew, because we're living in fascinating, changing times.'' But he said he wanted first to await the outcome of ongoing talks with the Soviets on conventional forces in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and also would consult with <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> allies before considering any reductions in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troop levels. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who will meet with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> two days next week aboard <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet naval vessels off the coast of <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION>, said he looked forward to discussing the changes in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and a wide-range of other topics with the Soviet leader. But to those who expect a major agreement on arms control or other superpower differences to occur the president cautioned: `` It is n't going to happen.'' `` We're not looking forward to crossing ` t's and and dotting ` i's at this meeting,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` But, look, there is so much rapid change going on in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> that I am very anxious for him, to hear from him what his thoughts are about the future of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>.''

 She is accused of supplying Saudi sheiks and millionaire executives with call girls, some who later appeared in the pages of Penthouse magazine or married into prominent families. Prosecutors contend even celebrities paid up to $ 2,000 a day for the sex services. In exchange, the high-priced prostitutes lived a jet-set life, following elite customers to <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION>. When vice officers crashed her <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> prostitution ring last year, <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> at first denied she was a police informant. Later, she recanted, saying she manned an inside pipeline for 16 years. `` Four of my girls married into very prominent families,'' Ms. <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> once said, refusing to name names. `` They're so polished. These people improved their lives thanks to me.'' Detective <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Vanderpool </PERSON> described her service as the best. Vice Capt. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Docherty </PERSON> portrayed Ms. <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> as `` a multibuck, big-time madam.'' Ms. <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> began working with police in 1972 and relayed to them information her call girls gleaned from their clients, she said in court papers. Her lawyer said she should be shielded from prosecution, or at least kept from incarceration, in exchange for her work as an informant. Ms. <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>, 56, allegedly told police about people who were involved in prostitution rings, along with firearms and narcotics trade. Police allege a Saudi prince once ordered a ski companion for his son through Ms. <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>. Most clients, however, were known only by code name. A motion to dismiss the case of the <LOCATION> Beverly </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Madam </LOCATION> is to be heard Dec. 1 in <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. Deputy District Attorney <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> said he is prepared to prosecute Ms. <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> on two felony counts of pimping and pandering. The charges carry a maximum of seven years in prison. She became known as the <LOCATION> Beverly </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Madam </LOCATION> because many people alleged to be clients booked their trysts in posh <LOCATION> Beverly </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION> hotel suites. Defense attorney <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brooklier </PERSON> claims the case should be dismissed because police encouraged Ms. <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> to continue her work and provide the department with inside information garnered in her `` pillow talk network.'' `` For some reason, when it's sack time, -LRB- men -RRB- make revelations,'' she was quoted as saying last year by the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> Times. The women `` hear things that the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> would give its eye teeth for.'' <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> said in a recent interview he could n't discuss the case. Ms. <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>, also known as <PERSON> Alex </PERSON> <PERSON> Fleming </PERSON>, was a police agent and `` officers should be bound by their promises that she would not be prosecuted, or at a minimum, that the defendant not be incarcerated,'' <PERSON> Brooklier </PERSON> argued. Ms. <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>, freed on $ 210,000 bail after being charged last year, declined through <PERSON> Brooklier </PERSON> to be interviewed. And he refused to disclose where she was living. In a declaration submitted to the court, Ms. <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> said she started working with police in 1972 following her arrest on pandering charges. For her cooperation, those charges were dropped. Deputy District Attorney <PERSON> Pamela </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferrero </PERSON> said last year that Ms. <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>' police record included one felony conviction, one misdemeanor guilty plea, fines and probation from four prostitution-related arrests since 1972. Officials `` were well aware of my activities,'' Ms. <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> wrote in court documents. She also said that because of her police connections, she was severely beaten twice and required hospitalization for her injuries. `` The information I provided led to the arrest and conviction of numerous offenders over a 16-year period. In return, the law enforcement officials have agreed to protect me against any prosecution which would lead to incarceration for my activities,'' Ms. <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> told the court. Retired police Sgt. <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Souza </PERSON> stated in an affidavit that Ms. <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> was identified in the 1970s as an agent for the department by a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee. He corroborated Ms. <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>' statement about the beatings and said she `` assisted detectives with information regarding numerous felony cases in the areas of prostitution, firearms, narcotics and other larcenous violations.'' <PERSON> Souza </PERSON> said Ms. <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> assisted police from 1972 to 1982, but <PERSON> Brooklier </PERSON> maintains the help continued until her arrest in 1988. Her enterprise unraveled when a former cook, <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON>, went to police, who sent in a young undercover policewoman to an interview with Ms. <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>. `` It's just like going on a date but you get paid for it. You never made money like this in your life,'' Ms. <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> told the officer in a tape-recorded interview on Feb. 29, 1988. `` Get a passport. <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>, you get to see the world.'' For fees of $ 150 an hour, Ms. <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>' employees would dine at fine restaurants and take cruises to the <LOCATION> Bahamas </LOCATION>. She would keep $ 400 of each $ 1,000 made, allegedly taking in about $ 100,000 a month. Ms. <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> came from <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> 20 years ago. She worked as a florist and antique shop owner. She said she was a mother and a widow when she was approached by an `` English madam'' who offered her a client book.

<HEAD>China Claims Most Joint Ventures Still Profitable</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TERRIL JONES</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Most foreign-invested joint ventures are reporting profits despite skepticism and a cloudy business climate after the bloody crackdown on political dissent in June, a government news report said Friday. About 85 percent of the 8,000 Sino-foreign joint ventures that have started operations have been profitable, <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said. `` If nobody makes a profit in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, how can we explain the fact that the number of businesses with foreign capital is increasing year by year, and many of them are expanding?'' <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> quoted <PERSON> Jing </PERSON> <PERSON> Shuping </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> China </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Consultants </ORGANIZATION>, as saying. In the first three quarters of this year, 4,281 joint ventures were launched with a total contracted value of $ 4 billion, <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> said. Since market-oriented economic reforms were begun 10 years ago, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> has approved 20,278 foreign-funded businesses, including 11,286 equity joint ventures, 7,712 contractual joint ventures and 1,230 firms wholly owned by foreign investors, the report said. They accounted for pledges of $ 32.2 billion by foreign investors and paid-in foreign investment of $ 14.1 billion. The report quoted unnamed analysts as noting that low monthly wages of $ 27, low taxes and a potential market of 1.1 billion people are the main incentive for foreign investment in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. It cited the example of <ORGANIZATION> Yili-Nabisco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Biscuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, a Sino-U.S. joint venture that makes Ritz crackers, which has captured 70 percent of the biscuit market in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> and reached this year's profit target in only six months. But uncertainties following the army's crackdown on the student-led democracy movement led to an exodus of foreigners in June, and sanctions imposed by Western governments have frozen loans, equipment and technical exports, and certain kinds of insurance for firms doing business in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. The government has launched a vigorous propaganda and financial aid campaign to reassure investors and lure new business. `` After the May-June unrest in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, many foreign investors and business people became skeptical about Chinese political and economic stability,'' <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> said. `` While some have gradually overcome their concern after learning the true situation, others are not sure how things really stand.'' Many of the joint ventures, morever, are strapped for funds under <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s year-old austerity program, which cuts government spending and credits to industry, and scrapped thousands of construction projects and implementation of new economic reforms. `` Some enterprises are now facing problems, such as shortages of ready cash, energy and raw materials,'' <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> said. `` Government departments are helping to tide them over by granting new loans and ensuring the supply of materials.'' The Bank of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, the nation's foreign exchange bank, announced this week that it will extend $ 108 million in loans to foreign joint ventures because of the financial crunch. The bank had already supplied $ 946 million in Chinese currency and an additional $ 800 million to foreign-invested firms this year. The <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> China </ORGANIZATION> is supporting 3,000 such enterprises with 10 different forms of loans to help them develop high-technology and export-oriented goods. The <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> China </ORGANIZATION>, the central bank, and the Industrial and <ORGANIZATION> Commercial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> also disclosed this week that they were providing large-scale loans to the government to purchase cars from faltering foreign-funded automakers, whose stocks are piling up without buyers. They include <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> Jeep and the French <ORGANIZATION> Peugeot </ORGANIZATION> joint venture in <LOCATION> Canton </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> quoted <PERSON> Jing </PERSON> as claiming that stability of leadership and support for the government are the basis for <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s renewed business stability. `` Despite the turmoil of a few months ago, life is back to normal everywhere,'' <PERSON> Jing </PERSON> said. `` People are walking about as relaxed as at any time before.'' Anti-government and anti-Communist Party sentiment runs high, however, and <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> residents say privately they fear the continuing investigations into the uprising and calls by authorities to inform on fellow citizens who took part in the protests.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> says he is `` prepared to think anew'' about reducing <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troop levels abroad because of changes in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> but wo n't take action without the <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> allies. `` I'm not suggesting that forevermore we'll have the same levels of troops anywhere _ standing army, <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, anywhere else,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said in an interview with foreign journalists. `` But we're certainly not going to take any unilateral action `` We do what we do in conjunction with our allies,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said in the Tuesday interview, a transcript of which was released Friday by the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>. `` We'll be perfectly prepared to think anew, always, because we're living in fascinating, changing times.'' First, however, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he wanted to await the outcome of talks with the Soviets on conventional force levels in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, and also <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON>'s review of <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> budget priorities. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who is to meet for two days next week with Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, said he was `` not a bit'' worried that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would lose its leadership role in the Western alliance if the changes in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> brought a significant drop in superpower tensions. `` If tensions got so reduced that you did n't always worry about U.S.-superpower confrontation or something, that would be a marvelous world,'' he said. `` We ought to work toward that kind of world. But it's got to be on our values. It's got to be on what we in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> think is best _ know is best.'' Also Friday, the White House announced that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> would meet with President <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> of <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> on Dec. 16 in the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION>, to discuss his meeting <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and a number of other issues. French officials said the two leaders would meet on the island of <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Martin </LOCATION>. In the interview with the foreign journalists, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> repeatedly sought to dampen expectations for the meeting with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, to be held aboard <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet naval vessels off the coast of <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION>. `` If you just get together and discuss change, that is my definition of success,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` We're not looking forward to crossing ` t's' and dotting ` i's' at this meeting,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> He said he believed the future of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, and the question of possible German reunification, should be decided by the citizens of each nation facing change. `` The role of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is to say: Here's what we think is best _ democracy. Freedom. Free elections. Freedom of the press. Freedom of worship. This is what we believe.'' Some congressional Democrats have labeled <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> `` timid'' for not taking a more active approach to the changes in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, with some critics suggesting he visit the Berlin Wall, recently opened by <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. `` Some have wanted me to go jump on top of the <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> wall,'' he said. `` Well, I never heard such a stupid idea. I mean, what good would it do for an American president to be posturing while Germans were flowing back and forth by the millions? It makes no sense at all.'' `` And that's one of the reasons we as the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> are trying not to listen to those out there encouraging flamboyant action, but to rather respond prudently, as a great power must, to the change,'' he said.

<HEAD>Spotted Turtle Stopping Conrail Project In Its Tracks</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WESTBORO, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The yellow-spotted turtle could fit in the palm of your hand, and that's right where the creature has <ORGANIZATION> Conrail </ORGANIZATION> and its plans to put a terminal at the turtle's wetlands sanctuary. The 4-inch spotted turtle was once the most common turtle in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>. Now the swamp-dweller is officially listed in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> as a species of `` special concern.'' Philadelphia-based <ORGANIZATION> Consolidated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rail </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> has been stalled in its tracks by concerns that seasonal vernal pools favored by the spotted turtle could be damaged if <ORGANIZATION> Conrail </ORGANIZATION> goes ahead with plans to expand its 1,000-car terminal facility off Route 495 to 2,600 spaces. The case is similar to the tussle in the 1970s over the snail darter, a tiny fish that held up construction of a <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> dam for a decade. In an attempt to soothe concerns of residents in this <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> suburb and state environmentalists _ as well as addressing the needs of the turtle _ <ORGANIZATION> Conrail </ORGANIZATION> has hired a pair of zoologists to study the spotted turtle and its habits. The scientists will ultimately draft a plan for moving the reptile to new accommodations nearby that would replicate their old home. `` There is a legitimate concern about the environment in this country,'' said <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, a senior vice president for legal affairs at <ORGANIZATION> Conrail </ORGANIZATION>. `` I believe in the need to balance our concerns with preserving the environment with the commercial demands that result from man himself being a domesticated animal,'' <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> said this week. The spotted turtle is far better off than the snail darter, which was threatened with extinction by the dam. As a species of `` special concern'' in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, it sits two notches down from the ranks of those considered `` endangered.'' Wildlife of special concern are documented as being in decline and facing a threat of disappearing from the state, said <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> French </PERSON>, assistant director of the state <ORGANIZATION> Natural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Heritage </ORGANIZATION> and Endangered Species Program. The <ORGANIZATION> Conrail </ORGANIZATION> plan for the turtles must pass muster with <LOCATION> French </LOCATION>'s office, its first hurdle in the turtle case <ORGANIZATION> Conrail </ORGANIZATION> began in 1987 to plan a proposed 27-acre project that would include paving 21 acres adjacent to the Great Cedar Swamp, a region designated by the state as one of critical environmental concern. But it was n't until April that environmental officials discovered the turtles there. The terminal construction is expected to cost more than $ 20 million. The new expense of accommodating the turtles is n't known, <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> said. The turtles came as a surprise, said <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>. But he insists the railroad does not regard them as an obstacle. `` We went into this project with the attitude that we were going to comply with whatever environmental laws were applicable to this project,'' <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> said. `` We have bent over backwards and assumed that wherever we ran into a problem we would take the measures appropriate. We're not going to run roughshod over the environmental laws.'' If the research and plan are satisfactory, the next steps are an environmental impact report, and obtaining permits from the state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineers </ORGANIZATION>. But it is unlikely to be as easy as that. The fight has already begun. The <ORGANIZATION> Westboro </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conservation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> approved the project. But that was before the turtle problem turned up. Community activist <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Hachey </PERSON>, an engineer, has joined in a lawsuit seeking reconsideration of the commission's action. `` It's an ill-advised project with little benefit to the general public,'' <PERSON> Hachey </PERSON> said. To build the facility, <ORGANIZATION> Conrail </ORGANIZATION> also needs a zoning variance, as well as permission to pave portions of wetlands and replicate them elsewhere on the property. It could be a long haul. `` A lot of people say, ` Oh, its just a silly little turtle','' said <PERSON> Hachey </PERSON>. `` But we do n't regard it as a silly little turtle. And if they -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Conrail </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- are able to lawyer their way around this, it'll be open season on state-listed rare species.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> could still make significant changes in abortion law, despite the out-of-court settlement of one of three key abortion-rights cases on its docket this session. The high court is scheduled to hear arguments Wednesday in cases from <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>, both of which focus on state laws requiring that one or both parents be notified before a minor gets an abortion. Those cases _ and an <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> dispute settled out of court earlier this week _ were seen by those on both sides of the issue as likely vehicles for the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> to expand or modify its July ruling allowing states greater leeway to restrict abortion. The <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> case, over state regulation of abortion clinics, was the most likely of the three to result in changes to the court's 1973 <PERSON> Roe </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Wade </PERSON> ruling, said <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Tunheim </PERSON>, chief deputy attorney general for <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> case affected all women, rather than just minors. `` I do n't think the <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> settlement will have any impact on our case,'' <PERSON> Tunheim </PERSON> said Thursday. `` The <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> case and the <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> case both involve what we view as a very, very different proposition _ the issue of minors' abortions.'' The settlement announced by <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> Attorney General <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> Hartigan </PERSON> and officials of the <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> would resolve a legal challenge to regulations requiring abortion clinics to be equipped and staffed like hospital operating rooms. In the case, <PERSON> Ragsdale </PERSON> vs. Turnock, Dr. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Ragsdale </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Rockford </LOCATION> contended that the state regulations would make it much more difficult and costly for women to obtain abortions. Despite federal court rulings that the law unconstitutionally limited women's access to abortion, <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> argued that the rules were necessary to protect women's health. Although regulations would be eased substantially for early abortions, tougher regulations would apply to clinics performing the procedure after 18 weeks, when there is a greater likelihood of a need for general anesthesia or the occurrence of complications, <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> ACLU </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, said today. However, a requirement that has been stricken for all abortion clinics, is a rule mandating that patients receive counseling from someone about birth control and adoption, he said. The old rules also required that the counselor must derive no profit from abortion procedures. A pro-choice group, Fund for the <ORGANIZATION> Feminist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Majority </ORGANIZATION>, says 91 percent of abortions on <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> women are performed before the 12th week, 8 percent in the second trimester and 1 percent in the third. Anti-abortion activists wanted the <PERSON> Ragsdale </PERSON> case to go before the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> because a favorable ruling would have made it difficult for abortion clinics to operate, said <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Schiedler </PERSON>, director of the national <ORGANIZATION> Pro-Life </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION>. But either the <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> case `` could still serve as a catalyst for eroding <PERSON> Roe </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Wade </PERSON>,'' he said. `` The court seems to be moving toward restricting abortions and they can do it with the cases they have left,'' <PERSON> Schiedler </PERSON> said Thursday. The Ragsdale settlement still must be approved by a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> judge in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. Attorneys for anti-abortion groups will try to scuttle the settlement in district court in hopes it could still go before the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Schiedler </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> ACLU </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, said he thought the <PERSON> Ragsdale </PERSON> settlement indicated the tide was turning against efforts to undermine <PERSON> Roe </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Wade </PERSON>. `` It's still a crap shoot, but I'm more optimistic,'' said <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, referring to the two abortion cases pending before the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. The key vote in the upcoming cases is expected to be cast by Justice <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Day </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON>, <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said. In July, hers was the fifth and decisive vote in <LOCATION> Webster </LOCATION> vs. Reproductive Health Services, in which the court allowed states greater leeway in regulating abortion. The ruling came on a challenge to a <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> law that, among other things, banned abortions in public hospitals and clinics. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration is pressing the high court to use the <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> cases to go beyond the <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> decision and overturn <PERSON> Roe </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Wade </PERSON>, which legalized abortion. Neither <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> nor <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> are asking the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> to overturn the pivotal ruling. The <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> case stems from a 1985 state law that requires that at least one parent be notified at least 24 hours before an unmarried teen has an abortion. A challenge by an <LOCATION> Akron </LOCATION> abortion clinic on behalf of a teen-age mother has been upheld by a federal appeals court. In the <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> case, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> for the <ORGANIZATION> 8th </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> upheld the state's law requiring notification of both parents. The <ORGANIZATION> ACLU </ORGANIZATION> has filed a brief asking the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> to overturn the <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> law on the grounds that the measure makes it more difficult for teen-agers to obtain abortions. Both the <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> laws permit teen-agers to bypass this requirement by obtaining a confidential court ruling authorizing the abortion without parental involvement.

 <PERSON> Maurice </PERSON> <PERSON> Tempelsman </PERSON>, a wealthy <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> diamond merchant often seen at social events on the arm of <PERSON> Jacqueline </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy-Onassis </PERSON>, is a major player behind the scenes of African-American relations. Little known to the public at large _ his name does n't even appear in Who's Who _ <PERSON> Tempelsman </PERSON> has contacts across the continent from when he started doing business more than three decades ago. The 60-year-old businessman is on a first-name basis with Archbishop <PERSON> Desmond </PERSON> <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s anti-apartheid activist; is called `` grand-pere'' by <LOCATION> Gabon </LOCATION>'s President <PERSON> El </PERSON> <PERSON> Hadj </PERSON> <PERSON> Omar </PERSON> <PERSON> Bongo </PERSON>; and entertains <LOCATION> Zaire </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Sese </PERSON> <PERSON> Seko </PERSON> <PERSON> Mobutu </PERSON>. Until recently, the balding, portly teddy bear of a man, preferred to remain behind the scenes. In 1989, <PERSON> Tempelsman </PERSON> became the board chairman of the prestigious African-American Institute, the country's oldest nonprofit organization dedicated to improving relations between the continents. In that capacity, he's delivered lectures and continued to travel to <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> as often as every two months. As an astute businessman, <PERSON> Tempelsman </PERSON> has cultivated Africans on all sides of the political spectrum. He recently set up an office in mineral-rich <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> in advance of November's elections, a precursor to independence in the South Africa-run territory. Over the years, he's been criticized from the left because of his ties to <ORGANIZATION> DeBeers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Consolidated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>, which mines diamonds from <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, among other places, and for once hiring the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION>'s top <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> official when the man retired from the agency. The right recently questioned <PERSON> Tempelsman </PERSON>'s dealings with Soviet-backed <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Tempelsman </PERSON> said he has a `` commercial relationship'' with that country's <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Diamond </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co </ORGANIZATION>. The Angolan government is embroiled in civil war with U.S.-backed rebels led by <PERSON> Jonas </PERSON> <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON>. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Caucus </ORGANIZATION>, a lobbying group, also has suggested that <PERSON> Tempelsman </PERSON> may have had something to do with <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>'s contract to sell oil to <ORGANIZATION> Citizens </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, a Boston-based energy company started by Rep. <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, D-Mass., Mrs. <PERSON> Onassis </PERSON>' nephew <PERSON> Tempelsman </PERSON> pooh-poohs these attacks as coming from a `` group of zealots who look at things from a conspiratorial point of view.'' Rep. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolpe </PERSON>, D-Mich., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Africa </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee, said <PERSON> Tempelsman </PERSON> frequently has attended the panel's <PERSON> Tempelsman </PERSON>, who generally favors economic sanctions against white-ruled <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, recently fought efforts to include uncut diamonds in the sanctions bill, <PERSON> Wolpe </PERSON> said. With the help of his lawyer, <PERSON> Theodore </PERSON> <PERSON> Sorenson </PERSON>, former speechwriter for the late President <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, <PERSON> Tempelsman </PERSON> helped persuade <PERSON> Wolpe </PERSON> and others that diamond sanctions would hurt countries like <LOCATION> Botswana </LOCATION> more than <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> because uncut diamonds are not identified by their country of origin. A staunch Democrat, <PERSON> Tempelsman </PERSON> gives freely to the party as well as to its political candidates. Nevertheless, he praised <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration officials for brokering a plan that led to elections in <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> and an agreement to withdraw Cuban troops from <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Tempelsman </PERSON> is the chief executive officer of <ORGANIZATION> Lazare </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kaplan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>, a diamond-cutting concern, as well as a general partner in <PERSON> Leon </PERSON> <PERSON> Tempelsman </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Son </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, an investment company with interest in minerals, agriculture and industry. In a wide-ranging interview at his penthouse office overlooking <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s Fifth Avenue, the Belgium-born <PERSON> Tempelsman </PERSON> reflected on how his business interests merged with his appreciation for <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, and how he sees the future of the world's least-developed continent. His office, guarded by a tight security system, is tastefully furnished with African art. All around are books and magazines dealing with art, from <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and the Greek and Roman periods. `` One is fortunate when career interests and philosophical interests coincide,'' he said. `` It's always nicer to work at something you like doing.'' The <PERSON> Tempelsman </PERSON> family came to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> around World War II. But <PERSON> Tempelsman </PERSON> did n't get involved in <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> until business took him to <LOCATION> Ghana </LOCATION>, the former <ORGANIZATION> Gold </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION>, in the mid-1950s. Decolonization, which has taken place over the last three decades, has been one of the `` more historical events in mankind's history,'' <PERSON> Tempelsman </PERSON> said `` I think <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> is the last chapter.'' While <PERSON> Tempelsman </PERSON> has prospered in part because of <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s minerals, some countries have seen their standards of living decline and their people embroiled in endless civil wars Describing nation-building as a `` risky adventure,'' <PERSON> Tempelsman </PERSON> said, `` That continent is going through an agonizing period, mostly economic, some self-inflicted, some subject to other factors.'' To alleviate some countries' problems, <PERSON> Tempelsman </PERSON> favors action from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> to wipe out some of their debt as well as more aid. Generally, though, <PERSON> Tempelsman </PERSON> said foreigners ca n't dictate to Africans how they should run their countries. `` It has to come from their own internal processes,'' he said. `` We can hector and condemn, but in the end both the benefits and the fruit of political independence mean you have the right to make your own mistakes.''

<HEAD>Plain English Campaign Cites `Practical Haplography'</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Fear of `` practical haplography'' earned a soccer coach a Golden Bull award Friday from the Plain English Campaign. `` We've had some superb Bull entries this year,'' said <PERSON> Chrissie </PERSON> <PERSON> Maher </PERSON>, director of the 10-year-old Plain English Campaign. `` The instructions for a toy plane said: ` Check if tail fine is complete pendicularity. Be in same length A to A.' And that was not bad enough to win.'' <PERSON> Colin </PERSON> <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON>, coach of the <LOCATION> Lincoln </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> soccer team, was cited for the impenetrability of `` Murph's Message'' in game programs. `` We can not fall into the trap of committing practical haplography,'' <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> wrote. `` It is also a dangerous feeling to consider that where we are in the league is of acceptable standard because standard is relevant to the standards we have set, which thereby may well indicate that we have not aspired to the standard which we set ourselves.'' <PERSON> Webster </PERSON>'s New World Dictionary, Third College Edition, does not define haplography, but Ms. <PERSON> Maher </PERSON> said it means accidentally dropping a letter or syllable when writing a word. <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> was also cited for this one: `` We must be the harbingers and nothing less than this can be acceptable.'' The other winners came from the usual ranks of bureaucrats and offices, and only three showed up to collect. <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> was among the missing. <ORGANIZATION> Halifax </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Building </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> won a Golden Bull for a letter which explained: `` In answer to paragraph two of your letter, the regulation 2 -LRB- b -RRB- states that the provisions contained in the Mortgage Conditions concerning insurance on the property will only be enforced if the borrower contravenes or does not comply with the Property Insurance Regulations.'' The tax office in <LOCATION> Aberdeen </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>, scored with this letter: `` I am sending you a copy of your new entry, your previous entry as amended or notification of the deletion of your previous entry, as the case may be, together with this notice in terms of section 15 -LRB- 5 -RRB- of the Abolition of Domestic Rates Etc. -LRB- <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION> -RRB- Act 1987 -LRB- ` the Act' -RRB-, as amended by paragraph 24 -LRB- 4 -RRB- of Schedule 12 to the Local Government Finance Act 1988 -LRB- ` the 1988 Act' -RRB-. In order to show what the amendment is, I am also sending -LRB- except in the case of a new entry -RRB- a copy of your previous entry.'' The campaign also presented awards for good English to two government departments and the <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> borough of <LOCATION> Hammersmith </LOCATION>, all past winners of <ORGANIZATION> Golden </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bulls </ORGANIZATION>. There's nothing complicated about writing plain English, Ms. <PERSON> Maher </PERSON> said, and she quoted <PERSON> Colin </PERSON> <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON>: `` If we continue to perform certain acts correctly then the correctness will manifest itself with correctability and we'll know then that correctitude will result.''

<HEAD>Communists Shift Blame for Current Crisis on Past Leaders</HEAD>

<DATELINE>EAST BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 East German leader <PERSON> Egon </PERSON> <PERSON> Krenz </PERSON> conceded Friday his <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s hard-line policies had plunged the nation into crisis. Labor leaders, meanwhile, called for an investigation of another disgraced Communist. Also on Friday, a third weekend of frenzied shopping and sightseeing began for East Germans, as tens of thousands started streaming into <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>. In its public statements, the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> appeared to be trying to show that past leaders _ and not <ORGANIZATION> Krenz </ORGANIZATION> and his new government _ are responsible for repression and economic stagnation in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Krenz </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> daily <ORGANIZATION> Neues </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deutschland </ORGANIZATION> that he agrees with reformists' calls for an end to his party's guaranteed `` leading role.'' Demands for abolition of the constitutional mandate for <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> rule have spread from pro-reform citizens groups to the ruling circle, as the current leaders struggle to divorce themselves from the policies of the past. But <ORGANIZATION> Krenz </ORGANIZATION> and other senior party and government officials were closely associated with ousted leader <PERSON> Erich </PERSON> <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON>. The association has robbed them of public gratitude for the popular reforms such as relaxed censorship and freedom to travel. In the battle to boost living standards and the leaders' credibility, party officials have launched investigations into alleged misuse of office by <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON> and his top lieutenants They have also joined the chorus of calls for sharing power. <ORGANIZATION> Krenz </ORGANIZATION> was asked during the <PERSON> Neues </PERSON> <PERSON> Deutschland </PERSON> interview about pro-democracy activists's attacks on Article 1, the constitutional mandate for Communist control. `` We are in favor of abolishing it,'' he replied. He said a party's success `` is not put forth through laws or declarations, but can only result from work, performance and its attitude.'' <ORGANIZATION> Krenz </ORGANIZATION> responded to widespread accusations of Communists' abuse of office by saying, `` We are not a corrupt party.'' But he conceded the Communists were responsible for `` many basic mistakes, ultimately the crisis of our society.'' Leaders of the government-run labor union Friday asked for an investigation of <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Tisch </PERSON>, an ousted Politburo member and the former government labor chief, for alleged abuse of power. On Thursday, the embattled party announced it had opened an investigation into alleged wrongdoing by <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON> and expelled the former economy chief from the party. <ORGANIZATION> Krenz </ORGANIZATION>'s close association with <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON>'s rule has fueled speculation that he may lose the party leadership at a special congress to be held Dec. 15-17. Since Nov. 9, when <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s travel rules were rescinded, more than 6 million have visited <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, mostly on the weekends. The vast majority have returned to their homes and jobs in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, but West German officials reported a trend toward more resettlers. Nearly 2,000 East Germans asked to stay in the 24 hours prior to Friday morning, compared with 865 during the previous day. In an interview with the newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Tribuene </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s new minister for finance and prices conceded that the long-demanded one-to-one exchange rate for East German marks with West German marks is unrealistic. The minister, <PERSON> Uta </PERSON> <PERSON> Nickel </PERSON>, said a true rate of exchange could be 4.4 East German marks to each West German mark, which is still less than half the unofficial rate set by traders in the West. <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> has rejected immediate setting of a conversion rate in fear that the subsequent price rises would be too harsh for those with fixed incomes to bear. But the lack of legal means to convert East marks for Western shopping trips has unleashed rampant black-market trading. <PERSON> Guenter </PERSON> <PERSON> Hartmann </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> allied with the ruling Communists, was quoted by the West German newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Bild </ORGANIZATION> as saying <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> plans to devote at least $ 1.62 billion in hard currency to a travel fund for East Germans. <ORGANIZATION> Bild </ORGANIZATION> also quoted <PERSON> Hartmann </PERSON> as proposing a council to handle affairs of concern to both nations, but said he called on <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION> to guarantee the existence of a separate East German state. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> has been hesitant to enter into treaties and contractual agreements that are tantamount to full recognition of East German statehood. The West German constitution embraces a goal of eventual reunification. <PERSON> Hartmann </PERSON> was quoted by <PERSON> Bild </PERSON> as saying that a single German state was not excluded from possibility in the `` distant future,'' but that it is not open for discussion at present. Also Friday, Austrian Chancellor <PERSON> Franz </PERSON> <PERSON> Vranitzky </PERSON> visited <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> and signed a wide-ranging agreement on economic cooperation. <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> says it will encourage greater business cooperation as part of the effort to stabilize the economy.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Nicolae </PERSON> <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc's longest-reigning leader, was reappointed Friday in a lavish show of support for his rejection of reforms washing over his <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> neighbors. Delegates to the 14th <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> cheered and clapped rhythmically in a repetition of the staged displays of adulation for their hard-line leader that have marked the congress since it opened Monday. <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON>, 71, told delegates he has no plans to step down from the post he has held for 24 years. His new term is for five years. `` I would like to assure the congress, the people and the nation that in the future I will continue to be a soldier fighting for socialism and <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>,'' he declared, his voice rising to a near scream. `` <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> has achieved a number of victories in its 1,000-year history, but none so great as the building of a new socialist society,'' said <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON>, who is called the `` conducator,'' or supreme leader. As he spoke inside downtown Palace Hall, parade marshals and police positioned phalanxes of workers, youth group members and the paramilitary people's guard in preparation for his appearance. State radio later said about 125,000 people turned out. The square before the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> building was full, with the crowds spilling into side streets. In his keynote speech Monday, <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON> condemned the whirlwind of democratization changing the systems of the formerly rigid <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> pact nations. But he refrained from that theme in his one-hour speech Friday. He lauded the role of `` the working class ... in doing away with the outmoded system of bourgeois democracy.'' His wife, <PERSON> Elena </PERSON>, sat on <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON>'s right on a stage reserved for ranking officials and foreign dignitaries. She gazed stolidly at the crowd below, in a scene reminiscent of Soviet bloc party congresses of the Stalinist era. Even before the onset of liberalization in the rest of the Soviet bloc, <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON> had been considered among the most hard-line Communist leaders, with his country's human rights record a frequent target of criticism abroad. An opening-day boycott of most of the 16-member <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> alliance was later expanded, with <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION> and most Latin American democracies breaking with past practice and keeping their heads of diplomatic missions away from the congress in protest. Strong suppression of any opposition to <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON>'s rule has generated a general climate of oppression, contributing to the problems of a population that has suffered through years of food and energy shortages, idling cars and keeping homes unheated during the winter. His government's program of razing ethnic Hungarian villages in <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> has led to his condemnation by human rights groups. <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON>'s steel grip on the party and on society has resulted in the development of a personality cult unequalled since the 1950s, when the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> feard and feted <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>, and its satellites their own leaders. Slogans of love and admiration sounded for <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON> within the congress hall were repeated by the masses later, as <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON> addressed them from the main balcony of the party headquarters, draped with a red-and-white slogan proclaiming `` <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>, Freedom.'' `` The whole activity of our party will be dedicated to building communism ... and safeguarding the independence and sovereignty of <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>,'' he declared. The congress theoretically had the power to reject <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON>, but his continued role as leader had been a foregone conclusion, with officials rolling their eyes when asked if he would be opposed. He was the only official candidate. <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON> was elected by the newly chosen 467-member <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> of old and new <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON> stalwarts, who in turn had been chosen by the delgates. The <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> also picked a 47-member Executive Political Committee, or politburo. Delegates also gave rubber-stamp approval to an economic program `` for the next five years and beyond'' foreseeing a strengthened role for the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> in daily affairs. <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON> called for the annulment of the 1939 Soviet-Nazi <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> treaty that agreed to the partition of much of <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> among the powers. One secret provision of the treaty ceded the Romanian province of <LOCATION> Bessarabia </LOCATION> to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and gave <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> control over the Baltic states.

 <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Milos </PERSON> <PERSON> Jakes </PERSON> and the rest of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> leadership resigned today after more than a week of huge protests of their hard-line policies, state-run media said. The resignations were offered at a closed-door, emergency session of the party <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, which was expected to approve them. They came after <PERSON> Jakes </PERSON>, 67, admitted that the party had not instituted reforms quickly enough and had seriously underestimated the effect of the pro-democracy movement sweeping <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. He was the third East bloc leader to fall from power in a little more than a month as support for the reforms instituted by Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> gains momentum. As the party met, hundreds of thousands of people in downtown <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> cheered <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Dubcek </PERSON>, the former party chief whose attempts to institute reforms in 1968 were brutally crushed by a <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact invasion. <PERSON> Jakes </PERSON> was responsible for the purge of <PERSON> Dubcek </PERSON> and a half-million other reformers from the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> after the invasion. He took over as <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief in December 1987. In its terse dispatch, the state-run new agency <ORGANIZATION> CTK </ORGANIZATION>, announced: `` The general secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> Czechoslovak </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Milos </PERSON> <PERSON> Jakes </PERSON>, and all other members of the -LRB- ruling -RRB- Politburo and Secretariat submitted their resignations so that a new leadership of the party could be elected. <PERSON> Jakes </PERSON> said he hoped the newly elected organs of the party will contribute to a more resolute implementation of the process of restructuring and democratization. `` During the evening session, proposals for personnel changes will be considered and a new leadership will be elected by secret ballot,'' <ORGANIZATION> CTK </ORGANIZATION> said. The dispatch said 30 more people were still due to speak at the meeting so it was not clear when the new leadership might be named. Shortly before the announcement, <PERSON> Dubcek </PERSON> made a triumphant return to <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION>, speaking in public in the capital for the first time since his ouster. `` Dubcek, <PERSON> Dubcek </PERSON>!'' and `` Long Live Dubcek!'' a crowd of 250,000 yelled as the former leader appeared at <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION>'s central Wenceslas Square, the site of repeated pro-democracy demonstrations. `` The ideal of socialism with a human face is living in the conditions of a new generation,'' <PERSON> Dubcek </PERSON> told the crowd. `` We must unify to raise our country to a higher level,'' he declared in a five-minute speech. `` An old wise man said, ` If there once was light, why should there be darkness again?' Let us act in such a way to bring the light back again,'' he said. <PERSON> Dubcek </PERSON> appealed to police, militia and the army `` to stand by the people's side,'' and not to destroy the search for democracy. `` Do not act against the people. Remember, you are from the people,'' <PERSON> Dubcek </PERSON> said. He also warned demonstrators to `` avoid extremist trends.'' Every day for a week, thousands of people have turned out for pro-democracy protests in <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>. They had demanded the resignation of <PERSON> Jakes </PERSON>, President <PERSON> Gustav </PERSON> <PERSON> Husak </PERSON> and other leaders associated with the hard-line policies pursued since <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pact </ORGANIZATION> tanks snuffed out <PERSON> Dubcek </PERSON>'s reform. The protests began after police on Nov. 17 brutally crushed a peaceful demonstration in <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION>. For the past week, <PERSON> Jakes </PERSON> had denounced the protesters as anti-socialists, but today, as he opened his last <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> meeting, he admitted his Politburo had made serious mistakes. `` For a week, our capital lives in a feverish atmosphere accompanied by large demonstrations,'' the official <ORGANIZATION> CTK </ORGANIZATION> quoted <PERSON> Jakes </PERSON> as saying. `` The tension is gradually spreading to other places in the republic. We must openly say that our country is at a fatal crossroads.'' `` We have underestimated completely the processes taking place in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> and especially recently in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and their effect and influence on our society,'' said <PERSON> Jakes </PERSON>. <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> has instituted reforms, including opening its borders and carving holes in the <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Wall </LOCATION>, since long-time leader <PERSON> Erich </PERSON> <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON> was ousted amid nationwide unrest on Oct. 18. This month, another <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> hard-liner, <PERSON> Todor </PERSON> <PERSON> Zhivkov </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION>, also lost his position. And <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> led the way by installing the first non-Communist-led government in the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc. The lone holdout among <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact leaders now appears to be <PERSON> Nicolae </PERSON> <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>, who has staunchly opposed democratic reforms. He was re-elected to another five-year term today.

 Hundreds of people lined up early to buy a 5-cent copy of <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Svobodne </PERSON> <PERSON> Slovo </PERSON> newspaper, but even the 50,000 extra copies printed failed to satisfy demand for the new champion of press freedom. Since Monday, the 45-year-old newspaper has lived up to its name _ Free Word _ and has become a key voice for democratic change in the reform movement sweeping the country. That's when its front page condemned a brutal police attack on thousands of students assembled for a peaceful rally on Wenceslas Square not far from its editorial offices. The newspaper brought a roar of applause from nearly 200,000 pro-democracy marchers who chanted the newspaper's name when they marched past its building. Circulation shot up 20 percent and it has been selling out by midday. `` It was a heart-warming experience,'' said deputy foreign editor <PERSON> Adam </PERSON> <PERSON> Cerny </PERSON>. `` I am very proud,'' <PERSON> Karel </PERSON> <PERSON> Volesky </PERSON>, head of the newspaper's book department, told a reporter. `` We were the first to supply free information.'' Editors have been busy over battered typewriters, the offices have not seen a painter for decades, and metal tubes containing copy rattle down to the printshop through the pneumatic dispatch system, causing a noise as if the walls were caving in. `` It's a museum,'' <PERSON> Cerny </PERSON> said with a smile. `` The printing presses date to 1936.'' Since Tuesday, <PERSON> Svobodne </PERSON> <PERSON> Slovo </PERSON> also has made available a third-floor balcony of its building as a rostrum for the speakers addressing the giant rallies pressing for changes in the nation's leadership every afternoon Officially, <PERSON> Svobodne </PERSON> <PERSON> Slovo </PERSON> is the newspaper of the <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, an ally of the ruling <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. But it departed months ago from the staid fellow-traveler line that has made Czechoslovak readers buy newspapers chiefly to read the sports page, crossword puzzles or ads. Monday's issue, however, made the paper a real thorn in the flesh of hard-line Communists. `` We have information that conservatives are sabotaging the distribution to places outside <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Volesky </PERSON> said. `` Packages with newspapers were removed from trains. But now students help us. They drive out in their cars with the newspapers.'' `` I am very proud,'' he repeated.

 Two <LOCATION> Pitkin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> commissioners ca n't tear down the increasing numbers of large, expensive buildings that annoy them.

The winner wo n't be the architect but the person who most accurately describes why the building in question is offensive. `` We reserve the right to impose our standards of taste,'' said <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Ethridge </PERSON>, a land planner, who is sponsoring the contest with <PERSON> Herschell </PERSON> <PERSON> Ross </PERSON>. The contest rules allow for anonymous entries in order to encourage architects and designers to take shots at their colleagues. The deadline for postmarking entries is Dec. 15. `` The decision of the judges is final, but not as permanent as bad architecture,'' the rules state, `` There is no need to be present to win, since you probably ca n't afford to live here.'' One turkey apiece will be awarded to winners in the residential and commercial categories. Two turkeys will be donated to feeding the hungry on behalf of the best anonymous entries.

 Parliament today elected <PERSON> Elias </PERSON> <PERSON> Hrawi </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Maronite </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> legislator, to be the new president to replace <PERSON> Rene </PERSON> <PERSON> Mouawad </PERSON>, who was assassinated after only 17 days in office. The election of <PERSON> Hrawi </PERSON>, 59, a wealthy agricultural engineer, was expected to advance efforts to form a national unity government that would introduce political reforms aimed at ending <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s brutal 14-year-old civil war But that effort will be opposed by the Christian army commander, Gen. <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>, who condemns the peace plan brokered by the <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> because it fails to say when <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>'s 40,000 troops will be withdrawn from <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. After being elected by lawmakers meeting under tight security in a hotel at this market town east of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> and sworn in by Speaker <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> <PERSON> Husseini </PERSON> as <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s 10th president, <PERSON> Hrawi </PERSON> made an acceptance speech. In it, he pledged to `` adhere to the Taif accord and work for peace'' in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. He referred to the peace plan worked out by <LOCATION> Lebanese </LOCATION> legislators last month in the <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> resort of Taif with the aim of ending the civil war. `` I promise the nation to follow the same path that martyred President <PERSON> Mouawad </PERSON> had planned for national unity,'' <PERSON> Hrawi </PERSON> said. The lawmakers applauded. Syrian President <PERSON> Hafez </PERSON> <PERSON> Assad </PERSON> sent a telegram to <PERSON> Hrawi </PERSON> saying, `` I see in your election an honor to the soul of the late President <PERSON> Mouawad </PERSON>, who was determined to end <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s torment.'' There was no immediate response from <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>, who has denounced the Taif accord and the earlier election of <LOCATION> Mouawad </LOCATION> as unconstitutional. <PERSON> Husseini </PERSON>, announcing the election to reporters, said <PERSON> Hrawi </PERSON> was elected by 47 votes in the second round of balloting. Five blank ballots were found and one deputy abstained. In the first round of balloting, <PERSON> Hrawi </PERSON> got 46 votes, two less than the two-thirds majority of 48 votes required by the Constitution. Earlier today, state television reported erroneously that <PERSON> Hrawi </PERSON> was elected by a unanimous vote of 53 of his fellow parliamentarians. <PERSON> Hrawi </PERSON>, who has represented the Zahleh region in <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> since 1972, maintains good contacts with the nation's Moslems as well as neighboring <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>. His election was announced just 20 minutes after the parliamentary session started at the Park Hotel in <LOCATION> Chtoura </LOCATION>, 23 miles east of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. The legislators mustered the needed quorum for a session after 14 deputies traveling from various parts of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> as well as <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> arrived at the hotel, raising the number present to 53, five more than required. `` <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> again elected a head of state. The nation is determined to survive in defiance of President <PERSON> Mouawad </PERSON>'s assassins,'' the announcer on state-run Channel 7 said Voice of the Nation, a Moslem radio station, said the new president would `` announce the formation of a national reconciliation government and appoint a new commander of the army.'' The report could not be officially confirmed. <PERSON> Mouawad </PERSON> was elected in Syrian-policed northern <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> on Nov. 5, after <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> threatened to shell the Parliament building in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> if legislators convened there. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> opposed the election of the Syrian-backed <PERSON> Mouawad </PERSON> and called him a puppet of the Syrian government, which has 40,000 troops in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. The body of <PERSON> Mouawad </PERSON> was flown to his hometown of <LOCATION> Zhorta </LOCATION> in north <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> today. He was to be buried Saturday. <PERSON> Mouawad </PERSON>, 64, a <ORGANIZATION> Maronite </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION>, and 23 other people were killed in a remote-controlled roadside bomb explosion in Moslem west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> on Wednesday. All Lebanese presidents have been Maronite Christians since the country became independent from <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> in 1943. Under terms of an unwritten covenant, the president is Maronite, the prime minister Sunni Moslem and the <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> speaker a Shiite Moslem. The bodies of <LOCATION> Mouawad </LOCATION> and six bodyguards killed with him were driven in four ambulances from the morgue of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> today to a seaside apartment that he had turned into a temporary residence in west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. The coffins were draped with the Lebanese flag. <PERSON> Mouawad </PERSON>'s widow, <PERSON> Nayla </PERSON>, and his children, <PERSON> Rima </PERSON> and <PERSON> Michel </PERSON>, wept as they joined the convoy outside the apartment building in <LOCATION> Ramlet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> al-Baida </LOCATION> and headed for the airport for the flight north. A <ORGANIZATION> Middle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> East </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 707 carried the bodies and <PERSON> Mouawad </PERSON>'s family to the <LOCATION> Kleiat </LOCATION> air base in north <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Mouawad </PERSON>'s election had ended 14 months of political vacuum after former president <PERSON> Amin </PERSON> <PERSON> Gemayel </PERSON>'s term expired with Parliment unable to gather the necessary quorum for an election session. The political turmoil triggered one of the country's bloodiest rounds of violence, pitting the Christian army troops of <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> against Syrian and Lebanese Moslem forces. Arab League intervention halted the fighting Sept. 22. The Arab League later brokered a Christian-Moslem peace pact which <PERSON> Mouawad </PERSON> was supposed to implement to end 14 years of civil war. He was trying to form a government of national reconciliation when he was killed.

 Polish Prime Minister <PERSON> Tadeusz </PERSON> <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON> assured the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> on Friday it could count on the solid partnership of the East bloc's only non-communist-led government, but said <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> wants to close deep historic wounds. President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> warmly greeted the former Solidarity editor and said that relations with <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> were improving. The election of <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON> on Aug. 24 ended more than 40 years of Communist rule in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. He saluted <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s policy of perestroika, and `` our and your freedom and solidarity.'' `` The changes which are taking place in our country do not alter the international obligations of <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and nobody should see in them a threat. On the contrary, they contribute to the stability of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and strengthen us as a reliable and solid partner,'' he said. But speaking at a <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> dinner after his first day of talks with the Soviet leadership, <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON> raised the painful issue of the massacre of Polish officers in the <LOCATION> Katyn </LOCATION> forest during World War II, which still hinders real reconciliation between Poles and Soviet. `` For Poles, the <LOCATION> Katyn </LOCATION> crime remains a wound which has not healed,'' <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON> said. `` We want to close all difficult chapters of history. This is not only a matter for our alliance, but for a real reconciliation of our peoples which is necessary for us and for you.'' More than 4,300 Polish officers were slain in the <LOCATION> Katyn </LOCATION> forest near <LOCATION> Smolensk </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> maintains the men were murdered by the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION> in 1941, while most Poles and Western historicans believe the Soviet secret police murdered them in 1940. <LOCATION> Katyn </LOCATION> was one of the issues that <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON> discussed when he met <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> for the first time Friday, his spokeswoman said. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said greater contact would further improve relations with his government. `` Maybe somebody would be surprised that I want to wish you success,'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> told <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON>. `` We are no less interested that your government and your nation _ has success.'' `` We, too, are very interested in the success of perestroika,'' replied <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON> through a translator, referring to <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s program of political and economic restructuring <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> spoke to a group of reporters in his Kremlin office before receiving <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON>. `` If you look back on our history, what is going on between our two countries is that there are new relations. I am sure this is for our mutual benefit,'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said. `` Relations between our peoples have changed for the better.'' <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON>, who spent over a year in jail after the 1981 martial-law crackdown, appeared relaxed despite the tight security and strict protocol. Poles held the Soviets responsible for the installation of a Communist regime after World War II but have welcomed perestroika and <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s policy of not interfering with democratic reforms under way in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. Polish government spokeswoman <PERSON> Malgorzata </PERSON> <PERSON> Niezabitowska </PERSON> said later the meeting lasted nearly two hours. `` The prime minister is very, very satisfied with these talks,'' she said. `` They were very, very open, wide and friendly.'' She quoted <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON> as saying that <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> is `` very interested in and knows a lot about <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and approaches the country with understanding.'' <PERSON> Niezabitowska </PERSON> said both sides also discussed economic issues, the dramatic changes in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, and the U.S.-Soviet summit. She gave no details. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> had expressed concern about a revanchist mood in connection with the events in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. Both <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> have suffered from German aggression and appear concerned about the re-emergence of a unified <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s upcoming meeting with Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON>, an old friend of <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON>'s from his days as editor-in-chief of a <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> weekly, also was discussed, she said. <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON>, a Roman Catholic, chose to make his first foreign trip to <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> to meet the pope rather than to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> as was required of his Communist predecessors. He also discussed <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s debt to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and the issue of Soviet oil and natural gas deliveries with Soviet Premier <PERSON> Nikolai </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ryzhkov </PERSON>, <PERSON> Niezabitowska </PERSON> said. The Polish side asked for an increase in gas deliveries and <PERSON> Ryzhkov </PERSON> pledged to honor its agreements with <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, she said. <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> would like the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> to ease repayment terms of its $ 1.5 billion hard-currency debt to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and is seeking to have future trade calculated on the basis of world prices. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> accounts for one-third of <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s foreign trade and working groups have been set up to work out ways to restructure economic relations. The new government has developed a market-oriented economic reform program and starting next year, <PERSON> Niezabitowska </PERSON> said that up to 15 percent of all exchanges would be on an experimental basis.

<TEXT>
 Prime Minister <PERSON> Toshiki </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaifu </PERSON> promised to `` work harder'' for political reforms Friday, the same day the first trial opened in a bribery scandal that toppled a predecessor and still shakes Japanese politics. Two defendants denied bribery charges related to an alleged influence-peddling scandal involving officials and the <ORGANIZATION> Recruit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, an information and publishing conglomerate. <PERSON> Kaifu </PERSON> told reporters the Recruit affair was `` an incident that should never be repeated. I think we have to work even harder on political reforms.'' <PERSON> Takashi </PERSON> <PERSON> Kato </PERSON>, a former vice minister of labor, and <PERSON> Masao </PERSON> <PERSON> Tatsumi </PERSON>, a former Recruit executive, pleaded innocent as their trials opened in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> District Court. <PERSON> Kato </PERSON>, 59, who was in a position to supervise Recruit's lucrative publishing business, was charged with receiving a bribe in the form of discounted shares in a Recruit subsidiary. The prosecution alleges <PERSON> Kato </PERSON> influenced <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> regulations to benefit Recruit's booming business. But <PERSON> Kato </PERSON>, while acknowledging the purchase of shares, said he was not aware of a bribery intent behind the stock deal and denied doing any favors for the company. `` Because of a lack of discretion, I have considerably damaged the credibility of the labor administration and caused trouble for the government and the court, and I deeply regret it,'' <PERSON> Kato </PERSON> told the court. `` But all the measures I have taken in the labor administration were, I believed, most suitable and I have never treated a specific company with a special favor,'' he said. <PERSON> Tatsumi </PERSON>, 47, who allegedly played an intermediary role between <PERSON> Kato </PERSON> and Recruit's founder, <PERSON> Hiromasa </PERSON> <PERSON> Ezoe </PERSON>, said he has no part in the bargain stock deal. `` I have never discussed the stock deal with Mr. <PERSON> Kato </PERSON> and Mr. <PERSON> Ezoe </PERSON>, and I have no knowledge about the details of the stock deal with Mr. <PERSON> Kato </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Tatsumi </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Ezoe </PERSON> will be tried Dec. 15 on seven counts of bribery. Four other trials are starting before Dec. 15 for two leading politicians, six bureaucrats and four executives of the <ORGANIZATION> Recruit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, which is accused of trying to win favors and influence by showering huge donations and stock deals. In charging <PERSON> Kato </PERSON>, <PERSON> Tatsumi </PERSON> and others involved in the stock deal, prosecutors referred to a 1988 <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> decision suggesting that trading stocks certain to rise in value and difficult for the general public to obtain could amount to bribery. <PERSON> Kato </PERSON> said in his defense he had no knowledge that the shares were certain to rise in value or that the public would not be able to obtain them. He also said he was not aware the stock prices were set at artificially low levels, as alleged. The trial is to resume Dec. 26. Defendants in later trials include <PERSON> Ezoe </PERSON> and <PERSON> Takao </PERSON> <PERSON> Fujinami </PERSON>, a former chief <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> secretary. The Recruit scandal has shaken the foundation of Japanese politics since it erupted last summer. It forced Prime Minister <PERSON> Noboru </PERSON> <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> from office and has been blamed for the governing <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION>' setback in July elections for the upper house of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>. In a desperate attempt to leave the scandal behind, the <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> selected the relatively young <PERSON> Kaifu </PERSON> as premier in August. <PERSON> Kaifu </PERSON> reiterated Friday that his party is following new guidelines curbing political donations from corporations. The party is considering whether to call elections for the more powerful lower house early next year.

 Doctors tried for five years to fuse the 10 personalities of <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON> so he could stand trial for the murder of his parents. His attorney believes death succeeded where the doctors failed. `` I think death was the final solution that caused the fusion of the personalities, which the state hospital refused to do,'' said <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Gerash </PERSON>, who represented <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON> throughout the case. <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON> died Thursday at <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> of complications from leukemia. He was 19 when the crimes were committed, and 25 when he died. He was charged with the Aug. 18, 1983, killings of his parents, <PERSON> Rod </PERSON> and <PERSON> Marilyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON>, whose bodies were found beside an isolated road in <LOCATION> Douglas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, just south of <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>. They were found face down, shot to death. He was arrested and charged with the deaths. He pleaded innocent by reason of insanity and a psychiatrist said he thought the teen-ager was suffering from multiple-personality disorder. Therapists eventually said they identified as many as 10 personalities and <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON> spent five years in the <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> <LOCATION> State </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Pueblo </LOCATION>. But <PERSON> Gerash </PERSON> said, `` They hired debunkers instead people who know how to treat the disorder.'' <PERSON> Gerash </PERSON> said he had hoped therapy would `` fuse'' <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON>'s personalities, making him well enough to stand trial <PERSON> Carolyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Herzberger </PERSON>, a spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> Colorado </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>, refused to comment Friday on the case. `` Anything we did in an attempt to fuse his personalities is privileged information about a patient, and no hospital in the country is going to discuss that,'' she said. Only last month, Douglas County Senior Judge <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Kingsley </PERSON> ruled that <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON> was competent to stand trial, and one was scheduled next month. <PERSON> Kingsley </PERSON> said he thought <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON>'s personalities were simply a good acting job. Just days after the competency ruling, <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON> was rushed to the hospital after a vomiting spell. On Nov. 7, doctors confirmed a diagnosis of acute lymphoblastic leukemia. <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON> initially refused chemotherapy because his wrists were shackled. <PERSON> Gerash </PERSON> said some of his personalities felt threatened by the restraints. The shackles were removed and chemotherapy began. On Sunday, <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON> tried to wrestle a gun from a deputy sheriff guarding him. His attorney said it was an attempt to commit suicide. On Thursday, he died. The controversy continues. <PERSON> Gerash </PERSON> said he talked to almost all of the personalities, and said no one really understood <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON> or his illness. `` Most of the time I talked to <PERSON> Justin </PERSON>. He varied a lot between <PERSON> Justin </PERSON>, and another personality <PERSON> Steve </PERSON>, a 40-year-old person who was very articulate. In 1985, he developed another personality, <PERSON> Holden </PERSON>, a hospital personality. I also saw a weeping child, Blue, handling the leukemia. There was a child of 11, <PERSON> Gray </PERSON>, and I saw Black. I was threatened once by Black. `` I saw another guy, <PERSON> Norman </PERSON>, who was prehomicidal, a tough-talking New Yorker who smokes. <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON> was allergic to smoke, but I saw him smoke,'' he said. However, the judge was not the only one who doubted <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON>'s diagnosis A columnist in the <ORGANIZATION> Denver </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> on Sunday criticized the $ 1,180 a day spent on caring for <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON>'s leukemia, which also will be billed to taxpayers because his trust fund ran out. The columnist, <PERSON> Woody </PERSON> <PERSON> Paige </PERSON>, wrote: `` Doctors have talked to a myriad of Carlson-produced personalities _ <PERSON> Steve </PERSON>, <PERSON> Justin </PERSON>, <PERSON> Black </PERSON>, Blue, <PERSON> Gray </PERSON>, <PERSON> Stacey </PERSON>, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON>, <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> and the Anti-christ. Where's Dopey and <PERSON> Sneezy </PERSON> Is this one person, or a touch football team? `` I'm certainly not making light of mental illness. Trust me. It is a serious matter. But the Mighty Carlson Art Players and their act is beginning to wear thin.'' <PERSON> Gerash </PERSON> said he understands the anger from the community. `` When you kill your father and mother, that's a wholesale violation of the Ten Commandments,'' he said.

 A skinny and smelly 8-year-old beagle is back home with his owners after being trapped for 19 days in a city sewer. Diablo appeared healthy except for an infected ear and weight loss, <PERSON> Marilyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said. The dog weighed 43 pounds when he disappeared, and only 19 pounds wen he was recovered this week. `` It's amazing. He looks wonderful. There is n't a broken bone in his body,'' she said. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said <PERSON> Diablo </PERSON> and the family's other pet beagle had been digging out of the yard and running away regularly since the Oct. 17 earthquake, but had always been found in the neighborhood until one day early this month when only the other dog returned. Repeated searches, visits to animal shelters and newspaper ads turned up no sign of Diablo until another <LOCATION> Roseville </LOCATION> resident, <PERSON> Patty </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, heard something that `` sounded like an echo'' of her two dogs as they ran in a field.

 Toxicology tests showed no abnormalities that could be the cause of an Aug. 13 plane crash that killed Rep. <PERSON> Larkin </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> and his pilot, the cornoner said.

 Police opened fire and hurled tear gas Friday to halt battling over ballot boxes, and at least 36 people died in the second day of voting in <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s bloody parliamentary elections. At least 88 people have been killed since voting began Wednesday to elect a new <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> and to decide the fate of Prime Minister <PERSON> Rajiv </PERSON> <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>. An assailant fired three shots at a polling booth in northern <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> moments after opposition leader <PERSON> Vishwanath </PERSON> <PERSON> Pratap </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> arrived to investigate reports of ballot fraud by <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> supporters. No one was hurt in the attack, which occurred as <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> was surrounded by voters complaining that <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> was rigging the vote, witnesses said. The national <ORGANIZATION> Election </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, flooded with complaints from both sides of voter intimidation and fraud, again threw out thousands of ballots and said those voters must go back to the polls Saturday. Voting is scheduled to end Sunday. At stake in the elections are 524 of the 543 seats in the policy-making lower house of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, which will choose the next prime minister. Turnout was moderate to heavy in the 10 states and two federally governed territories that voted Friday. Analysts have said a heavy turnout could hurt <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>, dogged for half of his five-year term by allegations of high-level corruption in his government. Indian elections are traditionally violent. At least 132 people have been killed in campaign-related violence since <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> announced elections on Oct. 17. In southern <LOCATION> Karnataka </LOCATION> and the northern states of <LOCATION> Uttar </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pradesh </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Bihar </LOCATION>, campaign activists battled Friday while trying to storm polling booths, tear up ballots and voter lists and stuff or steal ballot boxes, officials said. At least 33 people were killed. Police fired into the air and hurled tear gas to disperse the stone-throwing mobs there and in <LOCATION> Calcutta </LOCATION>, the capital of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bengal </LOCATION> state. Mobs in <LOCATION> Calcutta </LOCATION> attacked an office of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> India-Marxist </ORGANIZATION>, the governing party in the state. Police clashed with supporters of various parties who were attempting to seize ballot boxes. Three people were killed. Several polling booths also were bombed, although no one was hurt, officials said. In western <LOCATION> Gujarat </LOCATION> state, authorities imposed an indefinite curfew in some towns after police fired tear gas to break up clashes between rival groups. The <ORGANIZATION> Election </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION> has invalidated ballots in more than 930 of the country's 590,000 voting booths following reports of fraud. The number of repolls ordered by the commission more than doubles the 480 ordered during the December 1984 elections that propelled <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> to power two months after the assassination of his mother and predecessor, Prime Minister <PERSON> Indira </PERSON> <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>. <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>, whose <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> has governed <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> for all but 29 months since independence from <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> in 1947, is facing the most cohesive and determined challenge ever mounted by the country's usually splintered opposition parties The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, a five-party coalition with wide-ranging regional, religious and ideological differences, has promised clean government. <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> has told voters that the only party that can provide stablity is his <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, whose most famous leaders were his mother and his grandfather, <PERSON> Jawaharlal </PERSON> <PERSON> Nehru </PERSON>. <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> went to the village of <LOCATION> Dubrai </LOCATION>, 14 miles west of <LOCATION> Fatephur </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Uttar </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pradesh </LOCATION> state, after receiving reports that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> workers were rigging the ballots. The shots apparently were fired from a nearby rooftop after <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> stepped out of his car and was surrounded by a crowd of people, said a witness, speaking on condition of anonymity. <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> refused to say whether he thought the shots were aimed at him specifically. `` The aim was obviously the crowd of people, and I was one of them,'' said the 58-year-old politican. <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> spent all day touring the <LOCATION> Fatehpur </LOCATION> constituency, saying he wanted to prevent a recurrence of the allegedly widespread fraud and voter intimidation that took place in <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> Amethi </LOCATION> constituency during Wednesday's balloting. Villagers armed with batons and spears screamed `` Death to the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>!'' and promised to protect voters from troublemakers.

 Bad weather Friday night once again forced <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> businessman <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Branson </PERSON> to delay the `` greatest adventure'' of his life, a hot-air balloon crossing of the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION>. As hundreds of townspeople gathered in the cold late Friday and city officials prepared a fireworks display, <PERSON> Branson </PERSON> held a news conference to announce the launch was being postponed. `` My own feeling was to just tell the guys to get on with it,'' said <PERSON> Branson </PERSON>, dressed in his gray, fireproof flight suit. `` But there's just nothing you can do about the weather.'' He said a wind flowing down the side of a hill and onto the launch area had forced the liftoff, scheduled for 3 a.m. Saturday -LRB- 1 p.m. Friday EST -RRB- to be called off. He said he did not know when they would try again. A team of at least 60 technicians and staff has been on standby at the site for more than a week. <PERSON> Branson </PERSON> and his co-pilot, Per Lindstrand, want to become the first people to cross the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> in a hot-air balloon. The 6,200-mile flight to <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> is expected to take three to four days, but the two are equipped to spent five days in the balloon. `` I'm about to embark on the greatest adventure of my life, and I'm determined to enjoy it,'' <PERSON> Branson </PERSON>, founder of <ORGANIZATION> Virgin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Virgin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Music </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, said in an interview with The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. He and Lindstrand already hold the hot-air balloon distance record for a flight across the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> in 1987. That trip ended when the balloon flew out of control into the <LOCATION> Irish </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> off <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>. Final preparations for this flight, including the 6-hour-long process of filling up the balloon, began Friday evening on a baseball diamond in a local park that was turned into a launch pad. At the planned cruising altitude of 40,000 feet, winds can reach 200 mph. Organizers said the flight would set three records _ duration, distance and altitude. They also said the balloon, dubbed the <ORGANIZATION> Virgin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Otsuka </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Flyer </ORGANIZATION>, is the largest ever built. It has a diameter of 172 feet and weighs one ton. Miyakonojo is a small town surrounded by rice paddies and volcanic hills on the southern Japanese island of <LOCATION> Kyushu </LOCATION>. It is about 560 miles south of <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, far enough away from the city's busy air space to allow the balloon safe entry into the jet stream City officials had arranged to have a fireworks demonstration at liftoff and chartered buses to take people to the site. No one has successfully crossed the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> in a hot-air balloon, though three Americans and a Japanese adventurer piloted a helium-filled craft across it, from <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, in 1981.

This is so timely,'' an apparent reference to the fact that Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s visit comes a week before <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will hold a shipboard summit with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> Asked by reporters what they would discuss, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said before driving off in the golf cart, `` I'm just interested in getting the views of the prime minister on the rapid changes in eastern <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and the strength of the alliance and everything else. So we've got a good full agenda.'' Asked if the two leaders had any disagreements on the strength of <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>, Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> replied emphatically, `` No. None.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> has been firm in her statements that the strength of <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> should not be lessened, despite overtures from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and moves toward political and economic reform in several eastern <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> countries. In an <ORGANIZATION> NBC-TV </ORGANIZATION> `` Today'' interview earlier, she said that merely expressing a willingness for political reform is a lot different than actually achieving it. She told <ORGANIZATION> CBS-TV </ORGANIZATION>'s `` This Morning'' that she did not expect <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> to have any `` major surprises'' at the summit. `` After all, look at the events which have happened. ... I think that he'll want to work towards much greater security and to try to bring about the economic reform,'' she said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in recent days has emphasized that he intends to consult fully with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> allies before meeting with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and that he would spring `` no surprises'' on the <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> allies. Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> was to remain at Camp David for four hours before returning to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> in the afternoon. Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> said on <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Good Morning America'' program today that she was `` delighted'' with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s speech in which he praised <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s reforms, and praised <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s `` measured response'' to changes in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. `` It takes a long time to build democracy,'' she said. `` It's not so long to have demonstrations and to try to say that you want to tear down that system It takes a much longer time to build up the new one.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> is effusive in her praise of <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> _ with whom she has met several times _ lauding him as a reformer of courage and vision. But she is also cautious about his chances of completing the revolution he has unleashed. Therefore, she continues to advocate a strong <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> and opposes any changes in the present lineup of <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact forces, lest they become ammunition for <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s hard-line foes. Her legislative program for 1990 pledges <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> to uphold its <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> obligations and `` sustain the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kingdom </LOCATION>'s contribution to Western defense by maintaining adequate and effective nuclear and conventional forces.'' The 64-year-old prime minister is facing political troubles at home. Resurgent inflation and criticism of her combative leadership style have helped push her behind the opposition <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> in opinion polls. On Wednesday, rank-and-file lawmaker Sir <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Meyer </PERSON> announced plans to challenge Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> for the leadership of the <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> _ a position that has gone to her as a matter of formality during her 10 years in office. <PERSON> Meyer </PERSON> conceded he has no chance of success, but said he hoped to send the prime minister a message of disenchantment and possibly lure a major contender into the race if it should go to a second round of voting. Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>, in an interview published today, rebuffed the unprecedented challenge to her leadership, saying she is ready to fight two more general elections. The Times of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> quoted her as saying this week, `` By popular acclaim -LRB- in the party -RRB- I am happy to carry on.''

 About 80 percent of the readers who responded to a questionnaire would like to see the country's national anthem changed to `` <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> the Beautiful,'' Parade magazine says. Of the nearly 400,000 Americans who responded, 315,000 want to change the anthem, while only 74,000 voted to keep `` The Star-Spangled Banner.'' Parade asked readers their opinion in a questionnaire printed in the magazine in August 1988.

<HEAD>Drinking of Hard Liquor At Lowest Level In Three Decades</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BYRD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Americans' consumption of hard liquor has fallen to its lowest level in three decades, federal health researchers reported Friday. The national <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> reported that per-capita consumption of distilled spirits in 1986, the last year for which complete statistics are available, was the lowest since 1959. The average American drank 0.85 gallons of spirits in 1986, the lowest since 1959's 0.84 gallons, according to researcher <PERSON> Darryl </PERSON> <PERSON> Bertolucci </PERSON> of the Alcohol, <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Abuse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>. Preliminary statistics indicate that the decline continued in 1987, to 0.83 gallons, <PERSON> Bertolucci </PERSON> said. Distilled spirits are hard liquors such as whiskey, rum, vodka or gin. Beer and wine, which are fermented but not distilled, are considered separately. However, <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> statistics show that consumption of alcoholic beverages as a whole is on the decline. In its weekly report, the <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> said the drop in consumption of distilled spirits between 1985 and 1986 was the sharpest since 1956, in terms of both actual cases sold and the percentage of the decrease. Exact statistics behind those findings were not available Friday because of the holiday weekend. `` The decline in spirits consumption may represent changes in the drinking patterns and preferences in the drinking-aged population,'' the <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> said. `` These changes were reflected by greater interest in beverages with reduced alcohol content -LRB- light beers and wine coolers -RRB-, as well as increased public awareness regarding physical fitness, nutrition and alcohol abuse.'' Per-capita consumption of ethanol _ the actual alcohol in alcoholic beverages _ was 2.58 gallons from all beverages in 1986, the lowest since 2.64 gallons in 1977, the <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> said. Two out of three American adults drink, but a relatively small number of them account for most of the consumption of alcoholic beverages, the <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> said: 10 percent of drinkers, or 6.5 percent of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> adult population, account for half of all the alcohol consumed in the nation. Public health officials say average daily consumption of one ounce or more of ethanol _ about two beers, cocktails or glasses of wine _ is `` heavy drinking,'' and heavy drinkers run a seven-times greater risk of liver cirrhosis than non-heavy drinkers. At least 46 percent of the cirrhosis deaths among <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> men, and at least 15 percent of cirrhosis deaths among women, is attributable to heavy drinking, the <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> said. The <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> reported Friday that 26,151 Americans died of chronic liver disease and cirrhosis in 1986; 42 percent of those deaths were associated with alcohol. In another 13,475 deaths, chronic liver disease was a `` contributing cause,'' among other causes, the <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> said. High rates of death from chronic liver disease were scattered across the country, topped by 31 such deaths per 100,000 residents in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lowest </LOCATION> was <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION>, with six deaths per 100,000 people.

<HEAD>Sandinistas Quietly Issue U.S. Military Attache Visa</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The Sandinista government has issued a visa for a new <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> military attache in another quiet attempt to warm diplomatic relations between the two countries. According to one source, <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> recently offered to exchange ambassadors, but the report could not be immediately confirmed. Both countries expelled each other's ambassadors in July 1988, along with seven other diplomatic officers apiece. Earlier this year, both countries exchanged some junior diplomats, only to engage shortly afterward in more expulsions. On both occasions, <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> accused <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> diplomats of plotting to destabilize the government. <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> Lt. Col. <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Quinn </PERSON>, the new military attache, arrived in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> two weeks ago, as soon as his visa was issued by the <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> government, said a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> spokesman who spoke on condition his name not be used. `` The Nicaraguans did n't indicate the reason why they allowed him in,'' the spokesman said. <PERSON> Quinn </PERSON> had been ready to take up his post in <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION> for more than eight months, the spokesman said. <PERSON> Quinn </PERSON>'s predecessor, <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> Lt. Col. <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON>, left in April. `` This has n't led to any fundamental change in the visa situation or restaffing of the embassy,'' the spokesman said. Mercedes <PERSON> Borge </PERSON>, spokeswoman at the <ORGANIZATION> Nicaragua </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>, said the Nicaraguan government has not sent a military attache to its mission in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. A diplomatic source who demanded anonymity said <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON> <PERSON> Tinoco </PERSON>, the Nicaraguan deputy foreign minister, met with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Assistant Secretary of State <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Aronson </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> on Nov. 18 and offered to exchange ambassadors. <PERSON> Tinoco </PERSON> had been in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> heading a delegation in peace talks with the U.S.-backed Contra rebels. The talks collapsed Tuesday. No one at the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> was available to comment on the purported offer by <PERSON> Tinoco </PERSON>. <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Melton </PERSON> and seven other <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Embassy officers were expelled July 11, 1988, after an opposition march in the town of <LOCATION> Nandaime </LOCATION> ended in violent clashes between government forces and the marchers. The Sandinista government accused the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> of instigating the demonstration. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government retaliated, expelling Nicaraguan Ambassador <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Tunnermann </PERSON> and seven other Nicaraguan Embassy officials from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. The expulsions kicked off a `` visa war,'' with <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> establishing a rule requiring a 15-day waiting period for visas for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> diplomats. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> stopped issuing visas to Nicaraguans, saying the decision was because of the reduction in its consular personnel in <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION>. Since then, both embassies have been understaffed and run by junior officers. In January, in what the <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> government said was a sign of its good will, <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> offered to stop the visa war. Within weeks, <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> had issued each other visas to replace the junior diplomats expelled in July 1988. But with the expulsion in May of the two <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION> diplomats, the visa war was on again.

 A No. 7 train made its run with an extra car on Friday morning, its doors opening at elevated stops where the last car did not reach the platform, the <ORGANIZATION> Transit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION> said. `` I dread to think what could have happened. We were lucky, most definitely,'' said TA spokesman Termaine Garden after the mistake was discovered at 7:40 a.m. There were no injuries reported. The train's operator and conductor, who were responsible for inspecting the subway before it went into service Friday, will both be tested for drugs and alcohol, said Garden. According to the spokesman, the platforms on the No. 7 line can accommodate 11-car subway trains, but the train left the yard in the borough of <LOCATION> Queens </LOCATION> on Friday with 12 cars. Each time the train stopped at an elevated station in <LOCATION> Queens </LOCATION>, the doors on the last car opened beyond the platform, <PERSON> Garden </PERSON> said. Although the TA believes some passengers were in the car, no one walked out of the train and off the platform, he said.

 It was a strange type of anniversary, but it was an anniversary of sorts for socialite <PERSON> Mollie </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilmot </PERSON>: five years since a freighter crashed her seawall, damaged her swimming pool and stuck around for 105 days. `` I'm afraid the Mercedes is with me for life,'' the department store heiress and race horse breeder said this week. Even in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, `` I'll be walking alone on some obscure street, and someone will ask me, ` Any more ships in your back yard?''' <PERSON> Wilmot </PERSON> said as she cuddled her white Pekingese, Fluff, underneath the gazebo next to her renovated pool. Five years ago Thursday, when a maid jostled <PERSON> Wilmot </PERSON> awake and summoned her to a window to see it, she thought the rusting, aging Mercedes I `` an apparition,'' then realized otherwise. `` It was the most unusual thing, and that's putting it mildly,'' she said.

 The West must increase food aid to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> to help Poles make it through winter shortages, the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> said Friday. Officials from two dozen Western nations met to discuss economic and food aid they have given to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>. More than $ 370 million in food aid has been pledged to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, and more than one-third of that has been delivered. The remainder will be sent by year's end. More is needed, the <ORGANIZATION> EC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> said in a statement. The Commission put no price tag on the second food aid package under study. But <ORGANIZATION> EC </ORGANIZATION> External Relations Commissioner <PERSON> Frans </PERSON> <PERSON> Andriessen </PERSON> suggested recently it should total at least $ 220 million. The Commission is coordinating an international aid effort for <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> involving the 12 <ORGANIZATION> EC </ORGANIZATION> nations and a dozen other countries, including the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>. Most donor nations have lifted restrictions on Polish and Hungarian imports, it said. Officials said that in all, donor nations have pledged about $ 6.5 billion in food and economic aid, including $ 2.8 billion from the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> and $ 1 billion from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. They offered this rough outline: _ $ 443.8 million in food aid for <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. _ About $ 1 billion in development aid _ including funds for management training and environmental protection programs _ for both <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>. _ $ 470 million toward a currency stabilization fund for <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. _ $ 4.3 billion in investment credits for both <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. _ $ 211 million in other credits for <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, including $ 144 million for joint ventures. About 340 joint ventures have already been set up in <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> and 320 in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> with Western aid, officials said. Efforts are under way in such areas as agriculture, management training, environment and investments. These include training schemes for administrators, banking personnel and language teachers; joint action to fight pollution and improve waste management. Specific commitments to the two funds are expected to be made during a ministerial meeting of the 24 donor nations, to be held here Dec. 13. Polish and Hungarian government officials have been invited to attend that meeting. Western aid, notably long-term development loans and investment credits, is conditional on <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> continuing the process of democratization and reaching accords with the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monetary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION> on restructuring their economic and financial operations.

Mayor <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Daley </PERSON>'s press secretary, <PERSON> Avis </PERSON> <PERSON> LaVelle </PERSON>, said notice was too short _ the gathering was announced by <PERSON> Alderman </PERSON> <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Shaw </PERSON> on Wednesday afternoon. <PERSON> Daley </PERSON> has scheduled another memorial during Monday's council meeting, she said. `` This is not some sinister plot,'' <PERSON> LaVelle </PERSON> said. `` It's a reality of the holiday season. Many people had long-standing vacation plans or arranged to take today off.'' Although <PERSON> Shaw </PERSON> acknowledged that he did n't call for the gathering until 1:42 p.m. Wednesday, he blamed the lack of attendance on the city clerk's office, which is required by law to notify aldermen of meetings. `` It's ridiculous, it's ludicrous,'' <PERSON> Shaw </PERSON> huffed. `` It smells like <PERSON> Daley </PERSON> got his hand in the whole thing.'' Other aldermen, milling around the council chambers after the meeting was canceled, said the small turnout was unfortunate but not sinister. `` I do n't ascribe any racial motives to the failure of people to attend today,'' said <PERSON> Alderman </PERSON> <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>, who was <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s council floor leader and later ran against <PERSON> Daley </PERSON> for mayor `` I suspect it has more to do with the timing.'' <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> died two years ago Saturday after suffering a heart attack while working at his City Hall desk. His first term was marked by a split in the council between old-line machine Democrats and a coalition of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> supporters. The division stalled most of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s appointments and programs. He forged a council coalition shortly before winning re-election in April 1987. Most on Friday agreed council relations have progressed considerably since the acrimonious `` Council Wars'' that plagued much of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s administration. `` The bridges that he built are still in place,'' said <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> left behind a legacy of `` respect for all segments of our society _ the clock on those activities can never be turned back,'' he said. `` Certainly city government will not and can not operate as it had operated before Mayor <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Washington </PERSON>,'' said <PERSON> Alderman </PERSON> <PERSON> Bobby </PERSON> <PERSON> Rush </PERSON>. `` The council has really become a legislative body.'' But racial divisions continue to plague the council, <PERSON> Rush </PERSON> said. `` Race relations are still a very, very serious problem ... we still have a long way to go.'' Members of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s family planned a private memorial service Saturday at his gravesite.

 Eleven journalists and one scientist were flown to <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION> on Friday after being stranded for about two weeks in <LOCATION> Antarctica </LOCATION>, a spokeswoman for a South Pole expedition announced. The group had been been dropped off at a camp of the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trans-Antarctic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Expedition </ORGANIZATION> on Nov. 8, and was supposed to be picked up about four days later. But the expedition's plane was grounded when it ran low on fuel and it was forced to land on remote King <LOCATION> George </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, off the west coast of <LOCATION> Antarctica </LOCATION>. With the plane finally refueled this week, the dozen people were picked up and taken to the expedition's base in <ORGANIZATION> Punta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arenas </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION>, spokeswoman <PERSON> Cathy </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Moll </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paul </LOCATION>. All were reported to be in good health. The group had been flown to the camp in the <LOCATION> Patriot </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION>, about 830 miles from the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pole </LOCATION>, to meet with members of the expedition, who had arrived on Nov. 7 en route to the pole. The trekkers resumed their trip two days later, and were reported to be 453 miles from the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pole </LOCATION> on Friday. However, the plane's repeated delays, blamed on weather and technical problems, have prompted concerns about the expedition's chances for finishing its 4,000-mile journey by early March, before weather makes travel out of the area impossible The plane is needed to lay four more food caches in the 1,000 miles between the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pole </LOCATION> and the Soviet base of <LOCATION> Vostok </LOCATION>. The expedition, led by <PERSON> Will </PERSON> <PERSON> Steger </PERSON>, is making its seven-month journey to bring world attention to <LOCATION> Antarctica </LOCATION> and to demonstrate the power of international cooperation. The expedition's other members are from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. Despite high waves of ice, the team has averaged 24 miles a day during the past week, and may take a day off when it reaches its next food cache, expected Sunday, <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Moll </PERSON> said. All food caches beyond <LOCATION> Vostok </LOCATION> are already in place. But for the team to finish its trip, <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Moll </PERSON> said it must arrive at <LOCATION> Vostok </LOCATION> before temperatures drop below minus-50 degrees, and from there complete the remaining 860 miles before winds hit 150 mph and all transportation off the continent becomes impossible in early March. `` As weather conditions and maintenance of the airplane make this schedule extremely tight, expedition managers are investigating all other possible options including recalculating what essentials must be transported, hiring additional planes and a parachute drop of 50 barrels of fuel at the South Pole by Soviet aircraft,'' <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Moll </PERSON> said. `` We're working on combining every possible solution and we are confident that with everybody's help we can pull it off,'' she said. `` This should be interpreted by no one as a sign of giving up.'' The group that had been stranded at the Patriot Hills camp included three French film crew members, one Australian television journalist, one French still photographer, one French television journalist, two German magazine journalists, two members of an <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sports </ORGANIZATION> crew, one <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> print reporter and one Saudi Arabian oceanographer.

 Vice Premier <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON> <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> was quoted Friday as saying his left-leaning <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> will resign from <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s governing coalition unless more progress is made in <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> peace efforts <PERSON> Peres </PERSON>' remarks contrasted with upbeat comments from Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>, who returned from a visit to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> and said he had succeeded in relieving pressure on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to speak to the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>. In <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, a homemade bomb was found outside the home of a surgeon who transplanted the heart of an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldier killed by <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> guerrillas into a Palestinian. A person called two newspapers and claimed responsibility on behalf of right-wing Jewish extremists. In other unrest, troops shot and wounded 17 Palestinians, including a 9-year-old and two 12-year-old boys, during clashes in the occupied <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> reports said. The army confirmed one wounding and said it was checking the other reports. In his latest threat to topple the government, <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> said <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s talks in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> `` did not change anything'' in the negotiations process, <ORGANIZATION> army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION> said. `` If the <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> continues to be obstinate, there is a doubt Labor will sit with it in one government,'' <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> reportedly said, referring to the right-wing party <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> heads. The uneasy Likud-Labor alliance was forged after inconclusive parliamentary elections last year. <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> has repeatedly said he would dissolve the partnership unless <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> succeeded in starting peace talks with Palestinians. The parties are divided over what concessions to make for peace. Labor advocates withdrawing from some occupied lands, while <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> objects to that. Neither party has a majority in <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, with <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> and Labor holding 40 and 39 seats respectively in the 120-member legislature. If Labor resigns, it would likely mean early national elections, which are currently scheduled for 1992. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>, who spoke to reporters after his plane landed at <LOCATION> Ben </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gurion </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> near <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION>, claimed he had advanced his proposal to hold elections in the occupied territories as part of an interim plan for self-rule for Palestinians. He said President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> assured him during meetings in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> `` in a clear and unambiguous way that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> would not ask <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to negotiate with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>.'' Regarding his talks in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> said he hoped to overcome continued French and Italian demands that <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> negotiate with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>. `` If we do not succeed in convincing them, we can at least weaken their opposition,'' <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> said. Palestinians have balked at agreeing to elections because the <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> plan omits a role for the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> and fails to guarantee eventual statehood in the occupied lands. In <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, police spokesman <PERSON> Uzi </PERSON> <PERSON> Sandori </PERSON> said a makeshift bomb rigged inside a seltzer bottle was found outside the home of Dr. <PERSON> Dov </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, who transplanted the heart of soldier <PERSON> Zeev </PERSON> <PERSON> Traum </PERSON> into Palestinian <PERSON> Hanna </PERSON> <PERSON> Khader </PERSON> on Nov. 15. <PERSON> Traum </PERSON> had died of a gunshot wound suffered in the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> two days earlier. An anonymous caller to the <ORGANIZATION> Yediot </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Haariv </PERSON> dailies Friday claimed a right-wing group called the Sicarites planted the bomb and another left outside the home of a <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> professor who invited a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> activists to speak at <ORGANIZATION> Hebrew </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. `` If they do not leave the country within a week, we will wait for them in a dark corner with a machine gun,'' Maariv quoted the caller as saying.

<HEAD>Government Integrates Four Neighborhoods</HEAD>

<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The government Friday declared four neighborhoods in the country open to all races, easing a 39-year-old policy of strict residential segregation. `` I hope this will be proof of the government's serious attempt to normalize a lot of situations in our country,'' said Planning Minister <PERSON> Hernus </PERSON> <PERSON> Kriel </PERSON>. It was the latest in a series of acts by President F.W. de Klerk aimed at reducing racial friction in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. The far-right <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, which favors rigid segregation, condemned the decision. `` Mr. <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON> ignores the existence of ... white community life and draws a line through the traditional way of life and ideals by which whites have lived for centuries in this country,'' said J.H. <PERSON> van </PERSON> <PERSON> der </PERSON> <PERSON> Merwe </PERSON>, a member of Parliament for the Conservatives. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> warns Mr. <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON> once again urgently not to try to suppress the ability of whites to resist.'' <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON>, who assumed office in August, said he favors selected multiracial neighborhoods but will maintain segregated schools and residential districts for whites who want them. The four newly integrated neighborhoods are District Six in <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION>; a downtown section in the <LOCATION> Indian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> city of <LOCATION> Durban </LOCATION>; a thinly populated suburban area between <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pretoria </LOCATION>; and a small part of <LOCATION> Boksburg </LOCATION>, an industrial city east of <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION>. <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON> on Thursday proclaimed that people of any race may own businesses in <LOCATION> Boksburg </LOCATION>, overruling the council's effort to restrict ownership to whites. Anti-apartheid activists said opening only small `` free settlement areas'' will lead to overcrowding due to the acute housing shortage in black townships nationwide. `` While welcoming any move away from racially zoned areas, we can not admit to being ecstatic,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Cas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coovadia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Actstop </ORGANIZATION>, a group that has fought residential segregation. <PERSON> Coovadia </PERSON> said the move was an attempt to amend, rather than repeal, the Group Areas Act, which has formally segregated all neighborhoods by race since 1950. District Six, within walking distance of downtown <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION>, was a ragged but lively multiracial neighborhood until the government declared it a `` whites-only'' area in 1966 and renamed it Zonnebloem. About 40,000 non-whites were forced out and all the buildings were razed except for churches and mosques. So deep is the bitterness created by the evictions that few <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION> whites or businesses have sought any part of the area, and it remains an empty field. The multiracial <LOCATION> Durban </LOCATION> neighborhood is made up mostly of aging, downtown apartment buildings where some blacks already live. The area between <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Durban </LOCATION> has few residents but is expected to become a middle-class development. <LOCATION> Boksburg </LOCATION> has drawn international attention since the far-right <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> won control of the town council last year and began reimposing strict apartheid. The neighborhood that will be open to all races has fewer than 50 houses and many already are owned by Indian families. In another development Friday, a whites-only public school for girls that faced closure because it had too few students will become a multiracial private school, officials said. Education officials this year said they planned to close the 102-year-old <ORGANIZATION> Johannesburg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Girls </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> because enrollment dropped to 200 students, or one-third of capacity. Teachers, parents and students launched a campaign to keep the school open and said they would welcome black and Indian students to help increase enrollment.

 There's only one thing worse than spending hours shopping in a crowded, noisy department store on one of the busiest days of the holiday shopping season. Working there. I found out the hard way. I knew it was going to be busy in my day at the <ORGANIZATION> Younkers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Store </ORGANIZATION> when I saw the parking lot at Merle Hay Mall filling up and the shoppers crowding into the lobby just outside the sales floor more than a quarter-hour before the store's early 8 a.m. opening. Back in my hometown of <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, merchants and commissioned sales clerks have a real love-hate relationship with the official kick-off of the Christmas shopping countdown. They call it `` Black Friday'' for the sea of heads and the ungodly congestion in the malls and parking lots. I've always avoided even shopping then because journalists usually work on holidays. This year I avoided the shopping but not the crowds. One sore back, two aching feet, four long hours and about a hundred customers later, I thankfully went back to my real job. I was plunked behind the costume jewelry-watch counter in accessories and given a few tips about where the gift boxes were and what was on sale. By the time my five-minute orientation was over, customers were peering into display cases all around me and asking me questions. Within a few more minutes the rush was so constant there was n't even time to visit the restroom. Most of the shoppers were nice, particularly the ones excited about finding just the right gift. But there were those who made me finally understand why it's hard to be the always-polite, smiling sales clerk. There will always be people who make you want to be anything but that. Such as the lady who ignored her 8-year-old, leaving me to chase the girl out from behind our cash register and glare at her as she went around a display of earrings, gleefully snapping shut all the hinged jewelry boxes my fellow clerks had so carefully arranged. Or the woman whose son wanted a PopSwatch _ a watch with a face that pops out of the case, something I did n't know existed until Friday. He picked out the first one he tried and said he was sure it was what he wanted. Mom did n't like it, made me pull out every other style and then said they'd have to think it over and steered her disappointed son away, leaving me to put away all those PopSwatches. Or the dozens buying gifts who did n't really know what the receiver would like, leaving me to use my <LOCATION> ESP </LOCATION> to find just the right item. I ended up encouraging everybody to buy exactly what I liked, mainly so I would n't be tempted to spend a lot of money when I finally knocked off for the afternoon. And of course, there were the people who chose Black Friday to return items they'd bought a week before. And the lady who bought a watch and returned it in five minutes because she'd already seen something else she liked better. Then there were all the people leaving <ORGANIZATION> Cracker </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jacks </ORGANIZATION> _ in boxes and loose _ all over our once-spotless counters. They had been given the boxes at the door as part of a special sale; each box held a coupon for an extra discount of 10 to 20 percent off one item, or for a free shopping spree. The gimmick drew lots of shoppers, but it did n't do much for the condition of the floors. I think <ORGANIZATION> Younkers </ORGANIZATION>, a 37-store chain based in <LOCATION> Des </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Moines </LOCATION>, got one of the best deals of the day. I sold about 50 watches and the jewelry section was so busy all morning I kept wondering how they would have gotten by without me. And the area manager said she was hoping I would stay the whole day. My back and feet said otherwise.

 A barge that was adrift south of Prince <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sound </PERSON> with more than 5 million gallons of jet fuel on board resumed its tow to <LOCATION> Anchorage </LOCATION> on Friday after an inspection revealed no damage to the vessel. The 400-foot barge was towed out of Port Etches on <LOCATION> Hinchinbrook </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> by the same tug which lost it in rough weather Tuesday in the Gulf of <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>. The tow cable, which was new and had been installed just a week earlier, should have held despite the weather, said <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON>, a spokesman for the barge and tug owner, <ORGANIZATION> Crowley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Maritime </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. `` It had a breaking strength of 500,000 pounds, which is twice what you normally need,'' <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON> said. Commissioner <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Kelso </PERSON> of the state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conservation </ORGANIZATION> praised the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> for avoiding `` a potentially major spill.'' Had the barge drifted 12 more hours, it likely would have hit a reef or island at the entrance to Prince <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sound </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> said. The barge broke loose about 90 miles southeast of the sound, where the tanker <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Valdez </ORGANIZATION> spilled nearly 11 million gallons of oil March 24 in the worst oil spill in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> history. The weather in the area Tuesday included winds up to 92 mph and 20-30 foot swells, which had not been forecast, <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON> said. `` It's normally the kind of weather we would have skirted. But the skipper found himself in the middle of it and tried to make the best of it,'' he said. The crew of a <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> plane found the barge Wednesday and a helicopter dropped a radio buoy onto the vessel to help the tug find it. The tug reconnected to the barge by early Thursday and it was towed to Port Etches. An Army ordnance team had been placed on standby to blow up the barge and burn the fuel before the vessel could run aground. `` Anytime you have a separation you have a potential danger,'' <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON> said. `` But we had a contingency plan and it was under control.'' The barge, which originated at <LOCATION> Cherry </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Point </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION>, resumed the final 360 miles of its trip and was scheduled to arrive Sunday morning with the fuel destined for <ORGANIZATION> Anchorage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airport </ORGANIZATION>.

 Soviet TV on Friday gave its viewers a look at student strike organizers and <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION>'s Wenceslas Square packed with protesters in its continuing open coverage of the reform movement rattling Eastern <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. But the news that <ORGANIZATION> Czechoslovak </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Milos </PERSON> <PERSON> Jakes </PERSON> and other <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> leaders had resigned came too late for it to be included in the nightly `` Vremya'' news program watched by tens of millions.

<HEAD>Prosecutors Try 15 Ethnic Albanians; Former Vice President Charged</HEAD>

<DATELINE>TITOVA MITROVICA, Yugoslavia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Prosecutors on Friday indicted a former provincial <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief and 14 other ethnic Albanians on charges of instigating unrest that left 25 people dead in southern <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>. Police ringed the courthouse in this <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION> mining town 120 miles south of the capital <LOCATION> Belgrade </LOCATION> while <PERSON> Azem </PERSON> <PERSON> Vlasi </PERSON> and the others were formally indicted. There were fears of new unrest by ethnic Albanians, many of whom consider 42-year-old Vlasi their leader. Also Friday, the government <ORGANIZATION> Tanjug </ORGANIZATION> news agency said former <LOCATION> Yugoslav </LOCATION> vice president <PERSON> Fadil </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoxha </PERSON> also has been charged with fanning ethnic <PERSON> Albanian </PERSON> nationalism in <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION> province by publicly making `` insulting comments'' about non-Albanians in the province. It said <PERSON> Hoxha </PERSON>, a close associate of the late President <PERSON> Josip </PERSON> <PERSON> Broz </PERSON> <PERSON> Tito </PERSON> who served as the country's No. 2 leader in the late 1970s, will be tried in the <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION> town of <LOCATION> Prizren </LOCATION> for comments he allegedly made in November 1986. If convicted, he faces a maximum 10-year prison sentence. In the court in <LOCATION> Titova </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mitrovica </LOCATION>, authorities read a 99-page indictment of <LOCATION> Vlasi </LOCATION> and the 14 others that charged them with `` counterrevolutionary'' activities in connection with rioting by ethnic Albanians in <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION> in February and March. Prosecutor <PERSON> Spasoje </PERSON> <PERSON> Zamfirovic </PERSON>, reading the indictment, said they destroyed `` the brotherhood and unity'' of <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>'s ethnically disparate peoples. Authorities later adjourned the proceedings for a week. Ethnic Albanians make up about 85 percent of the 1.9 million people in <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION>, an adminstrative part of the republic of <LOCATION> Serbia </LOCATION>. The riots were sparked by constitutional changes _ opposed by <PERSON> Vlasi </PERSON> _ that gave <LOCATION> Serbia </LOCATION> tighter judicial and police control over the province. At least three ethnic <PERSON> Albanians </PERSON>, who protested the trial when it opened Oct. 30, died in violent clashes with police last month. Officials and the media in the western Yugoslav republics of <LOCATION> Slovenia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Croatia </LOCATION>, and international human rights organizations, have denounced the proceedings as a `` show trial'' staged by the <LOCATION> Serbian </LOCATION> leadership to intimidate ethnic Albanians in <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION>. Authorities in <LOCATION> Serbia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION> have consistently denied the trial is political. <PERSON> Louise </PERSON> <PERSON> Christian </PERSON>, a lawyer representing the Paris-based <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION>, was barred by security officials from monitoring the trial. <PERSON> Vlasi </PERSON>, who was ousted as provincial party chief last year, is accused of `` secretly visiting'' ethnic <PERSON> Albanian </PERSON> miners who staged an eight-day sit-in at a nearby mine in February to protest the adoption of the constitutional changes.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> discussed the <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> alliance amid rapid <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc changes Friday _ and were described as `` in very close accord'' _ as he prepared for his talks next week with Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. On an issue of crucial concern to Western allies in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, `` the two leaders agreed on the need for European stability as <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> faces the changes in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>,'' presidential press secretary <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said after the 4 -LCB- - hour meeting Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> told reporters after the talks that `` <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> is absolutely vital'' for continued defense of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. She said the allies have agreed on a strategy of, `` Do n't disarm too fast ... so that neither their security nor our security is in jeopardy. That's absolutely vital. Like <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, she sought to play down the importance of results from the summit next weekend. `` I do n't think there will be a great deal of difficulty or sudden surprises,'' she said at a press conference in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said that among other topics, `` The president and prime minister discussed reforms under way in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and agreed on support for glasnost and perestroika,'' new Soviet openness and economic restructuring. `` They both emphasized the pursuit of democracy as the first step in the reform process,'' in talking of East-West relations and European stability, he said. The two leaders, joined by advisers, talked on a snowswept day at <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s country retreat, where the president and his family are spending a long Thanksgiving holiday weekend. `` I'm just interested in getting the views of the prime minister on the rapid changes in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and the strength of the alliance and everything else. So we've got a good full agenda,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told reporters after Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> arrived by helicopter. Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> in her news conference later described their talks as `` very relaxed, very valuable.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, lightly clad in a sports jacket against the frigid temperatures, and Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, in a down jacket, along with their daughter <PERSON> Dorothy </PERSON> <PERSON> LeBlond </PERSON>, greeted Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> and her entourage and then drove in golf carts to their house. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>, `` I'm so glad you're here. This is so timely,'' an apparent reference to summit talks with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> next weekend on ships in the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> off the coast of <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION>. Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> had been expected to emphasize her view that the thaw in Western relations with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and the moves toward democratic reform in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> should not lead to a weakening of the <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> defensive posture. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said earlier this week that he, too, was committed to allied strength and would seek consultation with allied leaders. He plans to go to <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION> to report to those leaders on the way back from the summit off the coast of <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said that during the meeting with Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> summarized plans for the <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION> meeting. In addition, he said, they discussed regional issues, including the <LOCATION> Mideast </LOCATION> peace process, <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> and others. `` The two leaders were in very close accord in their examination of all the issues discussed today,'' said <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>. Also, the White House announced Friday that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will meet with President <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> of <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> on Dec. 16 in the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION>, to discuss his meeting with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and other issues. French officials said the two leaders would meet on the island of <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Martin </LOCATION>. While extending an offer to <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> to work together to end the Cold War, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said Wednesday night that he would not make any moves during the talks that would surprise the allies. The prospect of U.S.-Soviet talks against a backdrop of encouraging signs across <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> has produced jitters from some quarters in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> that the superpowers might work out a deal to cut back on <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact forces. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has repeatedly sought to allay those fears in recent days. He said in an interview with foreign journalists this week that he is `` prepared to think anew'' about reducing <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troop levels abroad in light of <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s changes but wo n't act without the allies. `` I'm not suggesting that forevermore we'll have the same levels of troops anywhere _ standing army, <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, anywhere else. But we're certainly not going to take any unilateral action,'' he said, pledging to act `` in conjunction with our allies.'' Asked by reporters at Camp David if she and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had different views on <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> strength, Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> replied emphatically, `` No. None.'' In the latest development in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, one-time reform leader <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Dubcek </PERSON> returned triumphantly to <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, the Politburo and the rest of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> leadership resigned Friday after a week of massive pro-democracy protests, according to the state-run media. Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> told reporters she hoped to see <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> become a democracy, `` But the wish is not the deed and it does take quite a long time to get all the democratic structures into place. And they must be genuine structures, not just a facade.'' Her <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> visit comes against a backdrop of political troubles at home, with inflation and criticism of her combative leadership style taking a toll.

 After nearly 20 years in virtual seclusion, <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Dubcek </PERSON> triumphantly returned Friday to the cheers of 300,000 anti-government protesters urging the rebirth of changes crushed by <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact tanks in 1968. The din of hundreds of thousands of voices chanting `` Dubcek! <PERSON> Dubcek </PERSON>!'' and `` Long live <PERSON> Dubcek </PERSON>!'' reverberated like a deafening ocean wave throughout <LOCATION> Wenceslas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION> as the ousted reformist leader took to the microphone. The noise subsided into a hushed, almost ghostly silence as the crowd waited for <PERSON> Dubcek </PERSON> to utter his first words in public in <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> since 1969. `` I'm glad to be among you,' <PERSON> Dubcek </PERSON>, 67, told the flag-waving crowd. `` I love you and you know it.'' `` The ideal of ` socialism with a human face' is living in the minds of a new generation,'' <PERSON> Dubcek </PERSON> declared, using a catch phrase of his doomed <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> Spring attempts to reform communism 21 years ago. Candles in the windows of the historic, 19th-century gabled buildings along the square glittered in the cold dusk, lighted to show solidarity with the burgeoning pro-democracy movement that has surged triumphantly through <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> in the past week. Home-made banners mocking the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> leadership _ one bearing a cartoon with the caption `` Dinsosaurs: They also had small brains'' _ flapped in the cold wind as protesters pressed to get a glimpse of <PERSON> Dubcek </PERSON> at a balcony window. For more than an hour, the throng cheered, whistled, shook small bells furiously and rattled keys in approval as speaker after speaker called for democratic reform and an end to <ORGANIZATION> Comunist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> monopoly rule. After the rally ended, <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>'s official news agency reported that party chief <PERSON> Milos </PERSON> <PERSON> Jakes </PERSON> and the rest of the hard-line leadership had resigned. <PERSON> Karel </PERSON> <PERSON> Urbanek </PERSON>, a Politburo member and former party leader of the <LOCATION> Czech </LOCATION> <LOCATION> republic </LOCATION>, was elected to replace <PERSON> Jakes </PERSON>. For many like <PERSON> Dubcek </PERSON>, the return to <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> was a triumphant and emotional journey after two decades of forced political exile and disgrace at the hands of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leaders. Until the dramatic developments of the past week, <ORGANIZATION> Dubcek </ORGANIZATION> has lived in relative obscurity in the Slovak capital of <LOCATION> Bratislava </LOCATION>. He worked as a low-level employee of the state forestry services. After his expulsion from the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> in June 1970, he was watched round-the-clock until Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> visited <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> in spring 1987. Still under surveillance, but freer to act and move, <PERSON> Dubcek </PERSON> carefully redeveloped contacts with former comrades and with prominent dissidents. He gave cautious interviews to Western media as well as Soviet and <ORGANIZATION> Hungarian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> TV </ORGANIZATION> _ moves that prompted sharp comment to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Budapest </LOCATION> from hard-line leaders in <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION>. Last year, in <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> to receive an honorary doctorate, <PERSON> Dubcek </PERSON> delivered a ringing defense of the Prague Spring. But it was not until Thursday, in <LOCATION> Bratislava </LOCATION>, that <PERSON> Dubcek </PERSON> was able to return to the public political stage in his own country. On Friday, his return was complete. `` Again, after a longer time, I appear before you and thus before all our people who once again raised their voices for a renewal of society, a renewal of our unbreakable community, of our nations, which are so close and related by blood,'' he said. `` This mutual bond is also today a pillar of the present democratic renewal, our inseparable and indivisible Fatherland of our two nations, <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>.''

<TEXT>
 Following, as translated from Slovak by The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, are excerpts of <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Dubcek </PERSON>'s speech to 300,000 people on Wenceslas Square Friday He refers to the two nations of <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>, a country formed by Czech lands and <LOCATION> Slovakia </LOCATION>: Dear popular meeting. My dear residents of <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION>, I love you, you know that, but I will tell you just the same. I am happy to be with you. Again, after a longer time, I appear before you and thus before all our people who once again raised their voices for a renewal of society, a renewal of our unbreakable community, of our nations, which are so close and related by blood. This mutual bond is also today a pillar of the present democratic renewal, our inseparable and indivisible Fatherland of our two nations, <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>. Yesterday, at the square in <LOCATION> Bratislava </LOCATION>, a crowd of more than 100,000 people met in the spirit of solidarity, of popular civic initiative which unites us in this historic elation. We all know that the present state of crisis in the country was caused by violent military intervention in the affairs and life which have belonged to the people of this country only. For this reason, departure from this unhappy legacy and from the whole so-called policy of normalization and its birth, is unconditional and brooks no delay. This is clearly expressed by the attitudes of all civic movements, of former <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> members who have been expelled, of youth, artists' and cultural movements, yesterday in <LOCATION> Bratislava </LOCATION> and today again here. I see this movement has found support in the working class, among peasants, in all strata of the working people. The broad and complex stream of today's great movement should converge into a joint stream which will once again elevate the initiative of the people, our country to a place it rightly has in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. Today, the new Civic Forum is being formed, with the platform of a new socialist renewal. I declare that I stand by this platform and give it my voice before the citizens of <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> and all working people. People of <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION>, in unity with all the people, played an important part in the renewal of socialism 21 years ago. I say this because the working class, People's Militias ... with the sympathies of our army and police stood side-by-side. I say this, that today, too, these forces should stand on the side of the people. Do not act against the people, you are a part of it, remember you are from the people. The ideal of socialism with a human face is living in the minds of a new generation. Do n't give way to extremist trends, so that the people's movement can be crowned with success and reflect the cultural level of this nation An old, wise man said, ` If once there was light, why should there be darkness again?' We had lived in darkness for too long. Let us act in such a way to bring the light back again.

<DATELINE>CAIRO, Egypt (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Hosni </PERSON> <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON>, in remarks published Friday, blamed foreign forces for the plight of Egyptian laborers working in <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> and accused the <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION> news media of exaggerating reports about the workers' problems. <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> did not specify what foreign elements might be involved nor did he mention the deaths of scores of Egyptians in <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION> airport officials have said the bodies of about 100 Egyptian laborers arrived from <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> in October and 50 more in the first half of this month. They said those figures compared to a previous montly average of 10-15. In many cases Iraqi certificiates listed violence as the cause of death. Thousands of Egyptians have returned from <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> in recent months. Some said many of the Egyptian workers were killed in fights with Iraqis over jobs after tens of thousands of <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> soldiers were demobilized following last year's cease-fire ending the eight-year-old war with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>'s government-run <ORGANIZATION> Middle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> East </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> quoted <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> as saying Thursday that <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Saddam </PERSON> <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> `` is among the most sympathetic people toward Egyptians. `` I reproach our own media for unduly widening the gap,'' <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> said. `` The truth is there have been mistakes made by <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> as well as Egyptian individuals. `` There are many who do not want our relations with <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> to be strong and sustained,'' he said. `` Before formation of the <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cooperation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, we expected there would be many external forces that did not want that kind of agreement.'' <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Yemen </LOCATION> formed the council last Februay. Its main purpose is coordination of economic policies. The agency said <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> praised <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> for being responsive to Egyptian questions about the Egyptian workers and expressed understanding of <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s financial difficulties after the war. It is estimated that up to 2 million Egyptian workers are in <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, but officials at <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION> airport said more than 30,000 have returned home since Nov. 1. They complained to the <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION> news media of insulting treatment by Iraqi employers, arbitrary dismissals and steep cuts in the amounts of money they could send back to their families. <PERSON> Makram </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohamed </PERSON> <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON>, editor of the government-owned weekly Al-Mussawar and a <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> confidant, said in an article that 975 bodies of Egyptian workers were brought back from <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> since the beginning of this year. Other reports placed the number at more than 1,000. <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON> said the number of dead `` may be normal in relation to the number of Egyptians in <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>.'' <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> said shortages of hard currency forced the dismissals of some workers and delays of remittances by Egyptian employees of their families. Reports estimate that the backlog of remittances amounts to about $ 370 million. `` Remittances have been delayed and we know the reasons behind this,'' <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> said. `` We are solving the problem with our <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> brothers.'' Last week <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> announced it planned to free $ 50 million to finance Egyptian remittances until the end of the year.

<HEAD>Switzerland Votes on Proposal To Scrap Its Army</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CLARE NULLIS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>GENEVA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Neutral <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION> decides in a referendum on Sunday whether to disband the country's army. Even supporters admit the proposal is headed for certain defeat. But if it gains close to 30 percent of the national vote, as some pollsters predict, it is bound to send shock waves throughout the military establishment. The government says Swiss neutrality and independence can be guaranteed only if this mountain nation of 6.4 million people retains a credible defense force. It urges voters to reject the proposed constitutional amendment, which simply proclaims that `` <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION> has no army.'' The 625,000-member reserve force, which can be mobilized in less than 48 hours, is rooted in centuries-old tradition. Although <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION> has not fought a foreign war since 1515, it can field more soldiers per square acre than any other country in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. It has more artillery pieces than <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and half the number of tanks <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> has. Every fit man must do military service, starting with 17 weeks of basic training at age 20, followed by 13 call-ups of two or three weeks until age 50. The proposal to abolish the army by the year 2000 was launched three years ago when pacifists and left-wingers collected the 100,000 signatures required to force a popular vote under <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>'s form of direct democracy. The `` Switzerland Without an Army'' movement says this small country would stand no chance in a war and abolishing the army would set an example for global peace. Movement spokesman <PERSON> Andreas </PERSON> <PERSON> Gross </PERSON>, a 37-year-old political scientist, concedes that traditionally conservative Swiss voters will not accept the initiative, but he says the proposal has injected a new dynamism into Swiss politics. Fierce debate on the issue filled newspaper letters' pages for weeks. A sports magazine canvassed leading athletes on their views. `` Abolition of the army ... abolition of the police ... abolition of the state. Anarchy and mob-law would take over,'' predicted <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Krebs </PERSON>. `` Our existence is threatened by environmental catastrophy, drugs and climate change. We can not meet these threats with weapons on the battlefield. ... We must realize that we do not face a real enemy any more, we are our own enemy,'' countered <PERSON> Therese </PERSON> <PERSON> Dubach </PERSON> on the same page of the <LOCATION> Zurich </LOCATION> daily, Tagesanzeiger. Reaction from abroad has also been varied, according to a survey last Sunday by the newspaper <ORGANIZATION> SonntagsBlick </ORGANIZATION>. West German Defense Minister <PERSON> Gerhard </PERSON> <PERSON> Stoltenberg </PERSON> told the paper, `` Despite improved East-West relations, every country needs a sound defense policy.'' But <PERSON> Juri </PERSON> <PERSON> Soldatenko </PERSON>, a disarmament specialist in the Soviet army, was quoted as saying, `` <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION> has no enemies. Therefore, abolition of the Swiss army would not have a destabilizing influence on <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>.'' `` No comment,'' was the official reaction from President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, said the newspaper. Three of the four parties in the Swiss coalition government oppose the proposal. The fourth, the Social Democrats, is taking no stance on the issue. A second vote on Sunday will determine if speed limits should be raised on major Swiss highways from 120 to 130 kilometers per hour -LRB- 75 to 81 mph -RRB- and on main roads from 80 to 100 kph -LRB- 50 to 62 mph -RRB-. The government urged voters to keep the present limits, citing environmental and safety factors.

 The Fisher Park Golf Course is a bogy for <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodvold </PERSON>. Lousy golfers on the city-owned, par-3 course are endangering the lives of Ms. <PERSON> Rodvold </PERSON> and her family, she contends. So she is trying to shut the course down, using 1,087 golf balls collected on their property over the past five years to buttress her case. `` We live in a war zone and we ca n't even defend ourselves,'' she said Friday. Although fairway property may be attractive to some people, Ms. <PERSON> Rodvold </PERSON> said ducking duffers' slices and hooks is a big handicap. Backyard barbecues and badminton are out of the question, she said. The problem is third hole at <LOCATION> Fisher </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>, a 9-hole course nestled in a middle-class neighborhood of this central <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> city. The Rodvolds' property sits across the street, less than 50 yards to the left of the green. Golfers teeing off on the 144-yard hole routinely send balls careening into the family's yard, Ms. <PERSON> Rodvold </PERSON> contends. Her scorecard so far includes 22 dents in family vehicles, seven windows shattered on the house and garage, and three car windshields destroyed. `` We've asked the prosecutor to close the course,'' she said. `` That is no place for a golf course to be, in a residential area.'' There was no answer at the golf course or at the county prosecutor's office Friday as many government agencies remained closed for Thanksgiving. But <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Flaherty </PERSON>, manager of the city park and recreation department, said recently he does not believe the problem is as serious as the Rodvolds maintain. `` We have tried to be accommodating,'' he said, adding that the tee has been adjusted three times to try to solve the problem. Last spring, a city employee charted activity on the third hole and found that of 2,356 tee shots, only six landed beyond the 6-foot fence ringing the course. `` One is too many if it kills one of us,'' Ms. <PERSON> Rodvold </PERSON> said. So far, neither she, her husband or their 10-year-old son has been hit by a ball. Last month, the family won a civil lawsuit against the golf course, receiving $ 2,500 for property damage and $ 3,700 for the disruption of `` their quietude of domicile.'' Superior Court Judge <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hanson </PERSON> did not rule the course a public nuisance, though. So the 27-year-old course is still open and golf balls keep landing in the Rodvolds' yard _ 128 times so far this year, they say. Neighbors do n't appear to be bothered. <PERSON> Kurt </PERSON> <PERSON> Weingarten </PERSON>, who lives a block away from the Rodvolds on the edge of course, said he finds about one ball a week on his property but has n't suffered any damage. `` I do n't know anybody upset about it,'' he said. `` A lot of people would rather have the park than something else come in.'' Not the Rodvolds. They have asked county prosecutors to file criminal charges against the city for 1,087 counts of reckless endangerment and 1,087 counts of criminal trespass by people and golf balls, she said. That's one count for every ball the family has confiscated since 1985, often in the face of threats from their irate owners, she said. The family bought the house in 1984 from Ms. <PERSON> Rodvold </PERSON>'s grandparents, unaware of the problem `` They were here before the golf course and this house was here before the golf course,'' she said.

 New Jersey Symphony musicians accepted a last-minute management contract offer on Friday, the first day of a strike, avoiding concert cancellations this weekend. The players' 12:01 a.m. strike deadline passed after an offer was rejected Sunday. But intervention Wednesday by Gov. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kean </PERSON>, who promised $ 200,000 in extra state aid, paved the way for the offer Friday, said management spokeswoman <PERSON> Helen </PERSON> <PERSON> Paxton </PERSON>. She said board directors also promised to raise an extra $ 200,000. In September, the musicians rejected an offer to reduce the season from 29 to 22 weeks, reducing their income. But they agreed to keep playing during negotiations. On Sunday, they spurned a one-year contract that would have restored the 29 weeks but abolished two weeks' paid vacation and frozen salaries at $ 690 a week. The players had asked for seasons of 32, 34 and 37 weeks over three years, said <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Clemmons </PERSON>, a member of the players' negotiating team The agreement calls for a guaranteed 28 weeks of work at $ 725 a week, plus one week of recording, and restores the two weeks of vacation under a one-year contract. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>'s premier symphonic ensemble has lately enjoyed a financial and artistic resurgence after years on the wane. `` The areas that we addressed as those of greatest concern were met,'' said <PERSON> Karl </PERSON> <PERSON> Herman </PERSON>, principal clarinetist and chairman of the players association. `` The musicians deserve the settlement we have reached and it is encouraging that they recognize the financial pressures we face,'' said board chairman <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> KixMiller </PERSON>. <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Sipser </PERSON>, counsel to the orchestra, said the number of weeks in the contract still was not enough to guarantee the players a decent living. He said the average number of weeks worked by comparable orchestras nationwide is 40 to 45 weeks.

 The most formidable challenge to <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s new president, <PERSON> Elias </PERSON> <PERSON> Hrawi </PERSON>, is just to stay alive. His predecessor, President <PERSON> Rene </PERSON> <PERSON> Mouawad </PERSON>, was assassinated by a bomb blast Wednesday after just 17 days in office. <PERSON> Bachir </PERSON> <PERSON> Gemayel </PERSON> was elected President on Aug. 23, 1982, and about three weeks later, on Sept. 14, he was killed. Many of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s political leaders, both Christians and Moslems, live under death threats from the rival factions engaged in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s 14-year-old civil war. <PERSON> Hrawi </PERSON>, a 64-year-old member of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> who is a wealthy agricultural engineer with a degree in commerce, on Friday became the 10th president of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> since it gained independence from <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> in 1943. He was elected by fellow Christian and Moslem legislators at a session of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> held with the protection of Syrian security forces at a hotel in the market town of <LOCATION> Chtoura </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Hrawi </PERSON> is a <ORGANIZATION> Maronite </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION>, as were <PERSON> Mouawad </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gemayel </PERSON>. He has maintained warm ties with Lebanese Moslems and <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>, the main power broker in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s civil war. His first official duty will be to lead government and political officials in mourning at <LOCATION> Mouawad </LOCATION>'s funeral Saturday in the slain president's hometown of <LOCATION> Zgorta </LOCATION> in northern <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Mouawad </PERSON> and 23 other people were killed by a remote-controlled bomb that ripped through the president's motorcade after an Independence Day ceremony in Moslem west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. He had been elected earlier this month by <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, but the Christian army commander, Gen. <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>, called the election unconstititional. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> also denounced the agreement reached by Lebanese Christian and Moslem parliamentarians at a meeting last month in <LOCATION> Taif </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>, in an effort to end the war. Rival Moslem and <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cabinets </ORGANIZATION> were established after <PERSON> Presiden </PERSON> <PERSON> Amin </PERSON> <PERSON> Gemayel </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Maronite </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> and brother of assassinated <PERSON> Bachir </PERSON> <PERSON> Gemayel </PERSON>, left office when his term expired in September 1988. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> leads the factional Christian government and rejected the Taif agreement because it did not specifically provide for the widthdrawal of some 40,000 Syrian troops. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> barred Mouawad from moving into the presidential palace in <LOCATION> Baabda </LOCATION> on the outskirts of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> and is expected to keep <PERSON> Hrawi </PERSON> out also. <PERSON> Hrawi </PERSON> was among the 59 members of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> members who approved the Taif accord on Oct. 24. <PERSON> Hrawi </PERSON> was elected to <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> in 1972 representing the eastern <LOCATION> Bekaa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>'s provincial capital of <LOCATION> Zahleh </LOCATION>. He served as minister of public works from 1980 to 1982. Friends and political associates say <PERSON> Hrawi </PERSON> is a patient, jovial man. <PERSON> Hrawi </PERSON> was born in <LOCATION> Zahleh </LOCATION> Sept. 4, 1925.

<HEAD>Proposed Anti-Terrorist Law Debated; Key Witness In Massacre Flees
To Miami</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Legislators debated a proposed law Friday that would restrict union, peasant and human rights groups by imposing long prison terms for many of their customary activities. The rightist government and the military consider most such organizations to be fronts for leftist rebels who have fought a decade-long civil war. Also Friday, officials said a key witness in last week's massacre of six Jesuit priests and two other people has fled to <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> after hiding in the Spanish Embassy Under the proposed laws, prison sentences of up to 20 years would be possible for those who participate in peaceful sit-ins or takeovers of buildings. People blocking traffic with marches or demonstrations could be jailed for five years. In a revision of another section of the penal code, the proposal would provide prison terms of up to 30 years for murder, kidnapping, armed assault or sabotage `` intended to provoke a state of terror.'' A provision that could affect the press, prescribes sentences of up to four years for `` spreading ... propaganda that subverts the public order.'' A <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said a witness in the Nov. 16 massacre has left the country. `` A departure was worked out in conjunction with the Salvadoran government and French, Spanish, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> officials,'' said embassy spokesman <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>. The head of the Jesuit order in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> Tojeira </PERSON>, identified the witness as <PERSON> Lucia </PERSON> <PERSON> Barrera </PERSON> <PERSON> Cerna </PERSON>. Officials said she had been staying in the Spanish Embassy since the incident. Attorney General <PERSON> Mauricio </PERSON> <PERSON> Colorado </PERSON> quoted the woman, who had worked as a housekeeper at <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, as saying she saw men `` dressed in military uniforms'' killing the Jesuits, their housekeeper and her daughter. Jesuit officials said the woman left Thursday for <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>. The judge in charge of the case would not let <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> see the statement she made before leaving. <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> had said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would do everything possible to obtain the testimony of witnesses and would offer them protection if necessary. The National Assembly, controlled by President <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON>'s rightist <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nationalist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION> and its allies, passed several key articles of the proposed law Thursday and debate continued Friday. No reports of the legislative action appeared in <LOCATION> Salvadoran </LOCATION> media, which have been heavily censored since the rebels brought the war to the capital two weeks ago. <PERSON> Ricardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Alvarenga </PERSON> <PERSON> Valdivieso </PERSON>, president of the assembly, denied that the law would cripple the opposition. `` I do n't believe it could limit the actions of anyone,'' he told reporters. <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON>'s government proposed the measure weeks after he took office, then put it aside in the face of domestic and foreign criticism. When he learned the proosals had been revived, Lutheran Bishop <PERSON> Medardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Gomez </PERSON>, a member of a national committee seeking negotiations to end the war, said democracy in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> had been `` destroyed.'' `` All we can do now is try to protect our people and our church,'' he said. His church is one of those raided by security forces in the past two weeks. More than a dozen Lutheran church workers have been arrested.

 A bomb squad found a time bomb in a school bag taken from a <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> jumbo jet on Friday and said only a loose battery wire kept it from blowing up the <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 747 over the <LOCATION> Arabian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> with 248 people aboard. Airport security officers said authorities ordered the jet to land in <LOCATION> Karachi </LOCATION> Thursday night following a $ 1.5 million extortion threat. `` It was a high explosive and would have destroyed the terminal building of <LOCATION> Karachi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>, in addition to the plane,'' said a commander of the paramilitary <ORGANIZATION> Karachi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>. He, like most other officials, spoke on the condition of anonymity. They did not disclose the weight of the device or other specifications. Security officers said they questioned all those aboard. They made no arrests and declined to say if they had any suspects or whether any group claimed responsibility. Saudi Arabian Airlines Flight 367 was bound from <LOCATION> Islamabad </LOCATION>, capital of <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, to <LOCATION> Riyadh </LOCATION>, the Saudi capital. Security officials said a cab driver delivered an envelope to an <LOCATION> Islamabad </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> security officer soon after the jet took off around 6 p.m. Thursday. Inside was an unsigned note threatening to blow up the plane unless a demand for $ 1.5 million was met, they said. The aircraft was over the sea when the <LOCATION> Karachi </LOCATION> control tower relayed the threat and ordered it to land at <LOCATION> Karachi </LOCATION>, officers said. It touched down shortly after 8 p.m., they said. After the airliner was emptied of passengers and luggage, officers found the bomb early Friday in an untagged, unclaimed school bag. `` We have recovered a bomb in a bag which was not tagged,'' said a security force officer, who gave the single name <PERSON> Ashraf </PERSON>. `` We have handed it over to the bomb disposal squad to get details on the type of explosive.'' Authorities said the discovery initially was kept secret to help their investigation. They said the bomb was set to go off at 7:20 p.m. when the aircraft was over water, but that a battery apparently had jarred loose, detaching a wire. Officials said they could not immediately reconcile the extortion note with the bomb's apparently having been rigged to go off automatically. Col. <PERSON> Noor </PERSON> <PERSON> Khan </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> Islamabad </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> said it was unclear how the bomb got past security there. `` It's not understood how they did it. Everything is there and working,'' he said of security devices. Baggage for international flights from <LOCATION> Islamabad </LOCATION> normally is inspected personally by customs agents and then screened by X-ray. Passengers with boarding cards pass through a metal detector and undergo a body search. Carry-on luggage is X-rayed a second time. A terrorist bomb exploded last Dec. 21 aboard a <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 747 over <LOCATION> Lockerbie </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>, killing 270 people. Investigators said the bomb was hidden in a cassette-recorder.

 The South African military presence in <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> has ended, with the withdrawal of the last 1,500 troops from the territory, the defense force said Friday. Also Friday, a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> official said Namibian guerrillas are to close the rest of their bases in neighboring <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> over the weekend. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> has ruled <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>, also called <LOCATION> South-West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, since capturing it from <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> in 1915, and has agreed to a U.N.-supervised transition to independence.

 A prominent Moslem said Friday he will make a <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> lecture tour to campaign for lifting of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s death threat against British author <PERSON> Salman </PERSON> <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>. `` A price on his head is below the dignity of the Iranian government _ it belongs to gangster movies and westerns,'' said <PERSON> Hesham </PERSON> <PERSON> El-Essawy </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> for the Promotion of Religious Tolerance. Essawy, a <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> dentist, helped found the society in 1982. He said it has a membership of scholars and leading Moslems in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> as well as non-Moslems committed to tolerance. The <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> newspaper The Independent quoted <PERSON> Essawy </PERSON> as saying the <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> affair harmed <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s Moslem community by encouraging a backlash that in turn stimulated extremism among Moslems. He intends to speak throughout <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> states in February and hopes to visit <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> if its government guarantees his safety. <PERSON> Essawy </PERSON> said he would quote from the Koran, Islam's holy book, to support his argument that Moslems should ignore <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>'s novel, `` The Satanic Verses,'' which some Moslem religious leaders denounce as blasphemous. `` The Koran has verses that actually fit the situation exactly: if unbelievers or hypocrites mock or insult the word of God, do not sit with them until they talk about something else,'' <PERSON> Essawy </PERSON> said. He said he also was incensed by the novel, but that <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s late leader, <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>, should not have called for <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>'s death last Feb. 14. <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>'s action drove the 42-year-old Indian-born writer into hiding. Two Iranian clerics offered rewards totaling $ 5.2 million for <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>'s death. At least 19 people were killed in riots over the book in <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Inspections of Abortion Clinics to Resume Next Year in Illinois</HEAD>

 A settlement rolling back some <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> restrictions on abortion clinics bars the state from taking certain steps to limit access to the procedure in the future, a party to the agreement said Friday. Under the settlement, access to abortions could not be restricted `` either by materially increasing the cost of the procedure or materially reducing the number of facilities without resulting in more than a marginal increase in safety,'' said <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION>. Illinois Attorney General <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> Hartigan </PERSON> and the Illinois <ORGANIZATION> ACLU </ORGANIZATION> agreed to the settlement Wednesday to resolve a lawsuit by <LOCATION> Rockford </LOCATION> physician Dr. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Ragsdale </PERSON>, who objected to regulations requiring abortion clinics to be equipped and staffed like small hospitals. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> had been prepared to hear arguments early next month in the case, which some abortion opponents hoped might be used to help overturn the landmark 1973 <PERSON> Roe </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Wade </PERSON> decision legalizing abortion. Clinics that perform abortions on women more than 18 weeks pregnant still will have to comply with the stringent state rules, which are designed to offset the higher risk of ending a pregnancy relatively late, <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said. But clinics that perform abortions on women during the first 18 weeks of pregnancy _ upward of 95 percent of abortions _ will be freed from `` stupid kinds'' of regulations that do n't protect patients' health under the settlement, he said. <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON>, a spokesman for a coalition of anti-abortion groups, called the settlement `` unconscionable and unconstitutional'' and said heading off a <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> decision on the case was `` a total sellout.'' <PERSON> Ragsdale </PERSON> had maintained that the state regulations were a veiled attempt to hinder women's access to abortion. <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> had argued that the rules were necessary to protect women's health. One requirement stricken under the settlement mandated that patients receive counseling about birth control and adoption and that counselors be people who derive no profit from abortions, <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said. Also changed was a requirement that all abortion clinics go through a public hearing process and obtain a `` certificate of need'' from the state verifying that they do not duplicate similar services in their areas. Clinics performing abortions before the 18th week of pregnancy would be freed from that requirement under the settlement, <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said. Dr. <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Turnock </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION>, said Wednesday that state officials hope to resume inspections of abortion clinics next year to make sure they adhere to the proposed new state regulations. `` We'll ... be in these facilities four times a year at a minimum to assure their continued compliance,'' said <PERSON> Turnock </PERSON>, who noted that officials had been barred from inspecting abortion clinics since 1985, when <PERSON> Ragsdale </PERSON> won a preliminary injunction.

 Federal health officials said Friday they have found `` statistically significant'' evidence that the nutritional supplement L-tryptophan causes a painful blood disorder now reported in 427 cases and at least one death. `` The studies appear to have very strongly linked the actual taking of these tablets and capsules with the disease,'' <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> researcher Dr. <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Falk </PERSON> said. It now `` seems extraordinarily likely'' that taking L-tryptophan causes the blood disorder, he said. The disorder, known as eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome, brings an abnormally high number of white blood cells called eosinophils, and causes severe muscle pain, or myalgia. L-tryptophan is a building block of protein, which is found naturally in a number of foods. Pills and capsules containing doses of the substance are taken by some people for insomnia, depression, premenstrual syndrome or weight control. Since reports of L-tryptophan and the blood disorder surfaced in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> several weeks ago, hundreds of case reports have come into the <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION>, with most cases occurring after July of this year, <PERSON> Falk </PERSON> said. A 58-year-old <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> woman who died from the disorder in September is the first confirmed fatality in the outbreak, and several other deaths are still under investigation in other states, <PERSON> Falk </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> report said the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> woman had been taking 5 to 6 grams of L-tryptophan daily. The Atlanta-based <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION>, in its weekly report, cited studies in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> which `` establish a statistically significant association'' between the product and the disease. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, each of 12 blood-disorder patients studied from May 1-Nov. 11 had used L-tryptophan In <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>, another 12 cases were investigated, and again, all had used L-tryptophan. The studies show a `` causal relationship,'' said <PERSON> Falk </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION>'s Environmental Hazards and Health Effects Division. `` We do n't yet know what exactly about those tablets and capsules has caused the disease.'' The disease has now been reported in 43 states and the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>. The number of L-tryptophan users nationwide remains unknown, but it appears to be large, <PERSON> Falk </PERSON> said. Some of the first potential cases of L-tryptophan-related <ORGANIZATION> EMS </ORGANIZATION> could not be confirmed. But all state health departments now have a detailed definition of the disease, and states are reporting new cases daily, <PERSON> Falk </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> researchers, in a recent follow-up study, found that 20 of 30 EMS cases were among patients using brands of L-tryptophan from one particular manufacturer. Such details can be `` a strong lead'' in the investigation, <PERSON> Falk </PERSON> said _ but he noted that there are numerous brands of L-tryptophan, and many can come from a single source, so any number of brands could be involved. It appears that most of the L-tryptophan sold in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> comes from four or five sources in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Falk </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> last week announced its intention to seek a nationwide recall of all L-tryptophan products in which the substance is the sole or major component. The <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> previously warned consumers to stop taking it.

 A woman trying to stop a confrontation between her son and four men over an alleged drug deal was shot and killed Friday in the house where she cared for 10 foster children. The children were not injured; most were sleeping during the 2 a.m. shooting. The woman's son and a man with whom he was arguing were wounded, authorities said. <PERSON> Moses </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, 36, will be charged in the death of <PERSON> Elsie </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, 59, who was shot in the chest, police said. Her son, <PERSON> Darryl </PERSON> <PERSON> Ross </PERSON>, 25, was in guarded condition at <LOCATION> Aultman </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>. Mrs. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> was shot when she tried to persuade <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> to leave her house, according to <LOCATION> Stark </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> sheriff's deputies. The hospital referred questions about <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>' condition to the sheriff's department, which said only that <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> had undergone surgery. Three men were charged with complicity to aggravated burglary and face court hearings Monday, said <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Umpleby </PERSON>, sheriff's chief deputy. One witness said that several people were firing at once, but police would not confirm that. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> and three companions allegedly went to the home to find <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> because they were seeking vengeance for a soured drug deal, deputies said. <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> and <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> shot each other, sheriff's Deputy Capt. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Shannon </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> also was stabbed several times. Police did not say whether any charges were being considered against <PERSON> Ross </PERSON>. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> fled with his companions after the shootings and soon showed up at the hospital, police said. The 10 foster children, whose ages ranged from 9 months to 16 years, were placed in other foster homes by the county <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>, the agency said.

 Dissident playwright <PERSON> Vaclav </PERSON> <PERSON> Havel </PERSON> and ex-Communist leader <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Dubcek </PERSON> hugged and drank <LOCATION> Bohemia </LOCATION> rose champagne Friday night to greet the end of the nation's two decades of gloom and despair. In a crackling day of political drama, <PERSON> Havel </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dubcek </PERSON> walked hand-in-hand into the jammed Magic Lantern theater. The two symbols of Czechoslovak freedom met on a stage of history, as the news of mass resignation of the entire Politburo hit the downtown <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> theater, where an opposition news conference was in progress. `` Long live free <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>!'' <PERSON> Havel </PERSON> toasted to the jubilant crowd which jumped to its feet in joy. Earlier, before sheer happiness and an overwhelming sense of unity flooded the entire hall, some differences between the two father figures of Czechoslovak independence still remained. `` I do not share the opinion that socialism is unreformable,'' <PERSON> Dubcek </PERSON> said when asked about the political future of his country on the eve of imminent change in the Communist leadership. `` The party must be more open,'' he insisted. <PERSON> Dubcek </PERSON> led the `` Prague Spring'' reforms crushed by Soviet-led armies of five <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact countries in August 1968, after the Soviet leader <PERSON> Leonid </PERSON> <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON> claimed counterrevolution threatened socialism in <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>. `` I used to pass myself for a socialist, but I have stopped using this word 15 years ago,'' <PERSON> Havel </PERSON> countered. `` This word completely lost its meaning in the Czech language,'' he said. `` It became a magic spell with which the bureaucratic power would protect itself.'' For 13 years <PERSON> Havel </PERSON> was persecuted as a leader of underground dissent. He spent four years in prison and the rest of his time under police surveillance. `` This can be different in other countries. But I do not use the word -LRB- socialism -RRB- anymore. What I want is social justice, there are many examples to learn from,'' <PERSON> Havel </PERSON> explained. Crowds outside the theater hugged and kissed each other, emotions choking the throats of youngsters who stood up at the beginning of this peaceful revolution. `` We are all tired and exhausted and we hope the society will take away this heavy load as soon as possible,'' said <PERSON> Igor </PERSON> <PERSON> Chaun </PERSON>, a pony-tailed representative of the students' strike committee, speaking in the theater. Students went on nationwide strike Nov. 18, the day after police beat peaceful demonstrators in downtown <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION>, sparkling off a wave of massive protests finally leading to the Politburo's resignation In spite of 40 years of almost continuous oppression, Czechoslovaks seemed to have reached a spontaneous political consensus overnight. `` We thank the students for returning time and history to this country,'' <PERSON> Havel </PERSON> said, his words drowning in cheers and tears on stage. `` Nobody gave this to us as a Christmas present, we have have taken that one ourselves,'' <PERSON> Michal </PERSON> <PERSON> Horacek </PERSON>, a lyricist, added from the wings. `` Finally, we can respect ourselves.''

 A federal judge threw out the Iran-Contra case against a former <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> station chief Friday, two days after Attorney General <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> barred courtroom use of classified information on <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> facilities and programs in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Hilton </PERSON> said criminal charges against <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON> focusing on his help to <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s secret Contra resupply network must be dropped Classified material the government refuses to divulge `` is essential to this defendant,'' said the judge. Associate independent counsel <PERSON> Laurence </PERSON> <PERSON> Shtasel </PERSON> asked Hilton for more time to work out a compromise with the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> to preserve part of the case, but the judge refused, saying his rulings about classified information in the <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON> matter `` have been known'' for `` quite some time.'' They were issued in July. Iran-Contra prosecutors will try to revive the case in the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, where they filed a notice of appeal following the session before <ORGANIZATION> Hilton </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Alexandria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Shtasel </PERSON> complained that <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> intelligence agencies `` have made bringing this case to trial extremely difficult. The office of independent counsel <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> has called the data the government is protecting `` fictional secrets'' that are widely known to the public. The information protected by an affidavit <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> filed Wednesday concerns the locations of three <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> facilities, including stations in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>. The government also is refusing to allow details to surface in court about three <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> programs in <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION>, the country where <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON> was <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> station chief. <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON>'s defense in part is that some of his activities on behalf of North were intertwined with initiatives by <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION> to protect itself from possible invasion by <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON> asserts, for example, that he did not lie when he told the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> inspector general that an airstrip built by the North network was an initiative of the Costa Rican government. North, the former <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> aide, is appealing his conviction on three charges: destroying government documents, aiding and abetting in the obstruction of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and accepting an illegal gratuity. Last July 24, the day <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON>'s trial was to begin, <ORGANIZATION> Hilton </ORGANIZATION> rejected a last-minute proposal by the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and independent counsel to substitute numbers for the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> facilities and to drop part of one charge dealing with an airstrip to avoid delving into the programs. The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> delayed the <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON> case for four months by seeking to appeal <ORGANIZATION> Hilton </ORGANIZATION>'s rulings, but was turned away by the appeals court in <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION>. Relations between the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON>'s office worsened during the delay, and the independent counsel's office was n't shown the attorney general's affidavit until it was filed in court <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> said in a statement Friday, `` I continue to believe that this case can be tried without compromising the defendant's right to a fair trial or the national security of this country. He said `` the independent counsel and I agree that the district court's earlier rejection of substitutions and alternatives to the release of classified material constituted reversible error.'' <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON> was indicted on four charges, including obstructing inquiries into the Iran-Contra affair by the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> inspector general and the presidentially appointed <ORGANIZATION> Tower </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> and making false statements. The retired <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> officer called <ORGANIZATION> Hilton </ORGANIZATION>'s decision `` wonderful'' but said he was troubled that <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> operatives performing what he said were legitimate duties could be subjected to a `` politically motivated prosecution.'' `` That is a chilling message to people who put their lives on the line every day,'' <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON> said. He said national security `` absolutely'' would have been endangered by disclosure at a trial of the classified information the government is keeping secret, which he said involves intelligence sources. <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON> characterized as `` onerous and unnecessary'' a question by a reporter who asked whether he had engaged in graymail, the practice of trying to force as much classified information as possible into a case in an attempt to scuttle the prosecution. The secret material at issue `` is the guts of the defense's case,'' said <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON>'s lawyer, <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> <PERSON> Shtasel </PERSON> told the judge that a possible compromise with the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> might involve `` narrowing charges as well as'' drafting `` findings against the government'' which would summarize some of the evidence <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON> wants to use in his defense. But anything `` short of using the information would essentially be a trial that is scripted beforehand ... by the independent counsel,'' said <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON>'s lawyer, <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>. `` That is not what the Constitution contemplates. The defense would not be able to cross-examine the government's witnesses effectively.''

Eight inches fell Thursday night at <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION>'s Sugar Bowl ski area near <LOCATION> Donner </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Summit </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Yellowstone </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> got up to 13 inches overnight. A winter storm watch was in effect in the <LOCATION> Sierra </LOCATION>. `` In any good storm, it's not unusual to get a couple of feet of snow and this one looks pretty good,'' said <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Fuller </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. Snow advisories were in effect for the mountains of southeast <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, the northern and western mountains of <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>, and elevations above 7,000 feet in northern <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>, with up to 8 inches expected. An advisory for snow and blowing snow was in effect for the northern and central mountains of <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>, where 4 to 8 inches were expected. Westerly winds off the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> carried rain over the northern and central <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION>, which turned to snow over the coastal mountains of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Red Square Pilot Under Investigation For Attempted Murder</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HAMBURG, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Mathias </PERSON> <PERSON> Rust </PERSON>, who served time in a Soviet jail for landing a plane on Red Square, is under investigation for attempted murder after allegedly stabbing a nurse who resisted his advances, law officials said Friday. Officials heading the investigation are `` convinced that Rust committed the deed with malicious intent,'' said a spokesman for <LOCATION> Hamburg </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>. Rust, 21, is in a <LOCATION> Hamburg </LOCATION> jail, said the spokesman, who refused to give his name. If convicted, Rust could be sentenced to up to 15 years in prison. On Thursday, Rust turned himself in to police hours after fleeing the Hamburg-area hospital where he was working as an orderly under the federal <ORGANIZATION> Civilian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, a pacifist alternative to compulsory military service. Police said Rust pulled an 18-year-old student nurse into a changing room, locked the door and tried to kiss her. When she resisted, she was stabbed twice in the stomach, police said. They identified her only as <PERSON> Stefanie </PERSON>. They said she underwent surgery right after the stabbing, but it was unclear Friday night how severe the injuries were. West German newspapers, without citing sources, said her condition was serious. Rust made world headlines when he piloted a borrowed Cessna across more than 500 miles of heavily defended <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> territory on May 28, 1987, and landed in downtown <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. His stunt led to a shakeup in the Soviet <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>. He was sentenced to a four-year prison term in September 1987 for violating international air safety regulations, illegal entry into the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and `` malicious hooliganism.'' Soviet authorities pardoned him in August 1988 and expelled him to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. He said in an interview at his home in suburban <ORGANIZATION> Wedel </ORGANIZATION>, west of <LOCATION> Hamburg </LOCATION>, he chose the <ORGANIZATION> Civilian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> because he opposed violence.

 <PERSON> Vincent </PERSON> <PERSON> Sardi </PERSON> can take back the legendary theater district restaurant he sold to a Broadway producer in 1986, a judge ruled Friday. The new owner, <ORGANIZATION> Sardi </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, and its president, <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON> <PERSON> Bloch </PERSON>, failed to make the monthly purchase payments and <PERSON> Sardi </PERSON> can foreclose on the note he holds, said trial-level <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Justice <PERSON> Burton </PERSON> <PERSON> Sherman </PERSON>. <PERSON> Sardi </PERSON> sold his West 44th Street restaurant to <PERSON> Bloch </PERSON> and his group for $ 6.2 million with $ 1 million cash down. Monthly payments were to include the remaining principal plus interest, a consulting fee for <PERSON> Sardi </PERSON> and a fee to keep him from opening another restaurant within five years. After one default in April, the debt was restructured. In July, <PERSON> Bloch </PERSON>'s group failed to make a required monthly payment of $ 136,262.38 and <PERSON> Sardi </PERSON> sued. <PERSON> Bloch </PERSON>'s group opposed the foreclosure, saying <PERSON> Sardi </PERSON> should have renegotiated with them again since he was aware of financial setbacks stemming from a decline in the Broadway theater industry, according to <PERSON> Sherman </PERSON>. The judge said <PERSON> Bloch </PERSON> accused <PERSON> Sardi </PERSON> of trying to grab the restaurant back because this theater season has the potential to be Broadway's best in years. <PERSON> Sardi </PERSON> is `` not under any legal obligation to renegotiate the terms of the note with the defendant,'' <PERSON> Sherman </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Bloch </PERSON>'s lawyer, <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Rubin </PERSON>, said he had n't discussed the ruling with his client. Open since 1922, <PERSON> Sardi </PERSON>'s is a favorite hangout for Broadway stars and star-gazers. Located in the heart of the theater district, the restaurant's walls are adorned with caricatures of stage greats.

<HEAD>Say Two Ringleaders of Medellin Drug Cartel Elude Police</HEAD>

 Two kingpins of the notorious <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> cocaine cartel managed to escape during a police raid on their operations center in a northern jungle and have eluded air and ground searches, officials said Friday. President <PERSON> Virgilio </PERSON> <PERSON> Barco </PERSON>'s office said police killed two cartel gunmen and wounded 10 others in shootouts during the sweep Thursday. Fifty-five people, including five women, were arrested at the jungle site and three nearby ranches, said the office communique. It reported no police casualties. Police seized 10 automobiles, two boats, weapons, ammunition and communications equipment during the raid about 110 miles north of <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION>, the communique said. The <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION> newspaper <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tiempo </ORGANIZATION> said the police operation was such a surprise that one of the cartel's kingpins, <PERSON> Pablo </PERSON> <PERSON> Escobar </PERSON>, fled wearing only his pants. National police Gen. <PERSON> Octavio </PERSON> <PERSON> Vargas </PERSON> said it was believed that <PERSON> Jorge </PERSON> <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Ochoa </PERSON>, another major leader of the <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> cartel, also was at the operations center when police attacked. He said helicopter gunships and warplanes crisscrossed the area in case the fugitives tried to escape by air, and ground patrols were making a methodical search of the jungle district some 70 miles east of <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Vargas </PERSON>, in a broadcast interview, said the raid was the result of a tip from a Colombian citizen and indicated the information was in response to a reward of nearly $ 300,000 offered for clues leading to <PERSON> Escobar </PERSON>'s arrest. He said the raid was carried out by a special anti-drug strike force created after drug traffickers received advance warnings about planned actions by regular police units. The strike force, backed by warplanes and army troops, was not told where it was headed or who might be captured, according to <PERSON> Vargas </PERSON>. He said a fierce gunbattle developed as helicopters carrying the strike force landed and the police charged. <PERSON> Escobar </PERSON>, and perhaps <PERSON> Ochoa </PERSON>, were able to escape as policemen fought with dozens of gunmen, <PERSON> Vargas </PERSON> said. He did not say how police knew that either <PERSON> Escobar </PERSON> or <PERSON> Ochoa </PERSON> were at the center, but <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tiempo </ORGANIZATION> quoted strike force commanders as saying clothing was found with documents belonging to <PERSON> Escobar </PERSON>. It said a shirtless <PERSON> Escobar </PERSON> was seen running into the jungle. A reporter and photographer from <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Tiempo </LOCATION> went with the police on the raid. The presidential communiqhe said cartel's operation center was in the state of <LOCATION> Antioquia </LOCATION>, at the junction of the Cocorna and <PERSON> Magadalena </PERSON> rivers. If <PERSON> Escobar </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ochoa </PERSON> were at the center or main ranch, it would have been the closest security forces came to capturing them since the government declared war on traffickers more than three months ago. <PERSON> Barco </PERSON> made a war declaration hours after traffickers assassinated a presidential candidate, Sen. <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Galan </PERSON>, at a <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION> election rally Aug. 18.

 A baby found wrapped in a garbage bag on a snowy sidewalk began recovering from hypothermia Friday and the family who found him said they would give `` many thanks'' during their postponed Thanksgiving celebration. `` It was a beautiful Thanksgiving after all because we saved a baby's life,'' said <PERSON> Floscelia </PERSON> <PERSON> Saunders </PERSON>, whose nephew <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Saunders </PERSON>, 31, tore through several bags of garbage to find the infant. The baby, estimated at about 2 hours old, was dumped in a plastic bag in the stack of garbage on a snowy curb outside the apartment building where Mrs. <PERSON> Saunders </PERSON> lives. Another abandoned infant was discovered Thursday in a cold apartment in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Haven </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn </LOCATION>. The girl, about 3 weeks old, was in fair condition Friday at the Hospital of <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Raphael </LOCATION>. A third abandoned infant died from exposure in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, authorities there said Friday. The 11-pound, full-term baby was less than five hours old when it was found dead in a plastic bag outside an apartment complex Wednesday. Authorities were searching for the mother, said <LOCATION> Ravenswood </LOCATION> police Lt. W.G. <PERSON> Sinnett </PERSON>. Police were also trying to find the mother of the child found in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. The infant, called <PERSON> Baby </PERSON> <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> in honor of <LOCATION> Saunders </LOCATION>, suffered from exposure to the cold, but was in stable condition Friday at <ORGANIZATION> Lincoln </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Jasmine </PERSON> <PERSON> Collazo </PERSON>, a hospital spokeswoman. The newborn's temperature dropped well below normal and did not register on a thermometer, said Dr. <PERSON> Jonathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Golden </PERSON>. A few more hours on the freezing sidewalk would have been fatal, he said. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> had its first white Thanksgiving in 51 years. The 4.7 inches of snow was a record for Nov. 23 and for Thanksgiving Day. The day's high was 31 degrees. The boy was born after a full-term pregnancy and weighed 5 pounds, 5 ounces, when he got to the hospital, <PERSON> Golden </PERSON> said. The baby was discovered after two children, <PERSON> Parod </PERSON> <PERSON> Mallory </PERSON>, 13, and his sister <PERSON> Felicia </PERSON>, 4, heard wailing and traced the cries to the garbage pile, said police Sgt. <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Donnell </PERSON>. The children alerted <PERSON> Saunders </PERSON>, who was walking up the block to join his aunt for Thanksgiving dinner. `` I ripped through all the bags and at the bottom of one bag there was another bag with the baby,'' said <PERSON> Saunders </PERSON>. `` I yelled up to the women to get the cops and an ambulance.'' `` We were all so excited _ you would have thought we all gave birth to the baby ourselves,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Saunders </PERSON> said. `` This all happened just before we were going to sit down before dinner,'' she said. `` We coud n't eat then because it was a terrible thing to see the baby that way. But we'll give many thanks today.'' Police found the <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> baby in a vacant apartment after receiving an anonymous telephone tip. A police spokesman, Detective <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Coffey </PERSON>, said he did n't know how long the child had been alone, or how cold it was. <PERSON> Coffey </PERSON> said police determined the call came from an acquaintance of the baby's mother. He said police were trying to find the mother, whom he declined to identify.

 Shoppers began their holiday buying wave on Friday, flocking to stores across the country to start retailers' biggest selling season of the year by bargain-hunting, browsing or seeking <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Claus </LOCATION>. Suburban malls and downtown shopping districts in many cities and towns were jammed with shoppers eager for hard-to-find <ORGANIZATION> Nintendo </ORGANIZATION> video games, electronic gear, costume jewelry, accessories, perfumes and novelty gifts. Many merchants expanded their hours, anticipating a crush of business on a day that traditionally is their busiest of the year. Despite earlier openings, managers in many areas arrived to find customers lined up waiting for stores to open, a hopeful sign in what has been a so-so year for retailers. `` It's wall-to-wall people,'' said <PERSON> Dianne </PERSON> <PERSON> Haynes </PERSON>, customer service representative at the <ORGANIZATION> Oxmoor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Louisville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION> `` They're definitely shopping and buying; everybody's got packages. We ca n't move in here.'' <PERSON> Evon </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, 35, waited in a crowd for stores to open at <ORGANIZATION> Valley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fair </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shopping </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jose </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION> `` My husband is staying home with the kids today,'' she said. `` It's freedom at any price. All the women worked hard yesterday and now it's a day for us.'' In nearby <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cruz </LOCATION>, residents flocked to the opening of a tent pavilion at the site of a downtown mall devastated by the Oct. 17 earthquake. `` We just felt we must support <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cruz </LOCATION> and see it come out of the rubble and live again,'' shopper <PERSON> Louise </PERSON> <PERSON> Bagnall </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Gilley </PERSON>, manager of the <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Roebuck </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> store at <LOCATION> Merle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hay </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mall </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Des </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Moines </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, said: `` <ORGANIZATION> Nintendo </ORGANIZATION> is selling awful good and camcorders are blowing out. Anything in the electric -LRB- department -RRB- is selling very well.'' The <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Claus </LOCATION> at <LOCATION> Raleigh </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Crabtree </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mall </LOCATION> said most of the several dozen children who had confided their requests to him Friday morning asked for <ORGANIZATION> Nintendo </ORGANIZATION> items. A few crowd-stoppers fell into the gag gift category. Pots of Rock' n Flowers _ colorful, plastic flowers that `` dance'' to music _ entertained customers at the entrances to a number of stores. <PERSON> Rita </PERSON> <PERSON> Eisenberg </PERSON>, spokeswoman for <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Wanamaker </PERSON>'s department store in downtown <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, said Yuppy Puppy products appeared popular. For $ 2 to $ 65, the pet products include Haute Canine gourmet popcorn and bagels, chewable sneakers and french fries, faux pet pearls and gold chains. Heavy markdowns at some troubled stores triggered waves of bargain hunters. The six <ORGANIZATION> B. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Altman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> department stores in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> drew hordes of people to liquidation sales. <PERSON> Altman </PERSON> is virtually going out of business _ leaving only its <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION> store open _ because its financially ailing parent <ORGANIZATION> Hooker </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> could n't find a buyer for the chain. The morning crowd clamoring to get into <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Altman </PERSON>'s main store in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> was so heavy that shoppers were admitted in shifts. By mid-afternoon police surrounding the exterior of the enormous store were turning people away, saying the building was dangerously overcrowded. Special prices and services for shoppers who showed up early boosted traffic at many places. The <ORGANIZATION> Wal-Mart </ORGANIZATION> discount store in Terre Haute, <LOCATION> Ind. </LOCATION>, offered extra low prices on selected items from 7 a.m. to 10 a.m., Assistant Manager <PERSON> Kris </PERSON> <PERSON> Gates </PERSON> said. During a 7 a.m. to 11 a.m. sale at <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Meyer </PERSON>'s, a discount store about 20 miles south of downtown <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>, shoppers drank free coffee, sipped apple cider and munched on doughnuts. Shoppers at <ORGANIZATION> Grossmont </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> outside <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> could leave their youngsters at a free child care center and take beepers in case of an emergency. <PERSON> Emporium-Capwell </PERSON>'s outside <LOCATION> Oakland </LOCATION> lured <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Area </LOCATION> buyers with free valet parking for three hours. The early starting times were n't a resounding success everywhere. In <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, only a few shoppers had turned up when <ORGANIZATION> Charleston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Town </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>'s anchor stores opened at 8 a.m., two hours earlier than usual. `` It has n't exactly been a door-busting event,'' said <PERSON> Bonnie </PERSON> <PERSON> Godfrey </PERSON>, senior merchandising manager for the <ORGANIZATION> J.C. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Penney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. Inc. store there The wintry weather that blasted the Northeast may have been a blessing for retailers that had been having poor sales of cold-weather goods. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s first Thanksgiving snowfall in 51 years, combined with freezing temperatures, apparently put people in the mood to buy warm clothing, said <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Stock </PERSON>, spokeswoman at the <ORGANIZATION> Bloomingdale </ORGANIZATION>'s in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>. Almost half of retailers' annual business is done in the weeks between Thanksgiving and Christmas. Most retailers and industry analysts are expecting cautious spending this year on expensive, long-lasting goods, such as home appliances. Overall retail sales are predicted to rise only 5.5 percent over last year, compared with 1988's surprisingly strong 9 percent gain. Typically there is a crush of shopping done in the days immediately after Thanksgiving and then a long lull until the final, frantic days just before Christmas. For the most part, shoppers seemed happy to jostle their way through the crowds if it meant finding good deals. Shopping at an <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> mall, <PERSON> Mattie </PERSON> <PERSON> Wyatt </PERSON> said she did n't mind looking for presents amid the post-Thanksgiving throng. `` It's convenient, there's enough parking, and there are sales,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Wyatt </PERSON> said `` What could be better?'' But there were indications shoppers would be choosy this year. `` I'll probably wait until after Christmas to see if I can get anything cheaper,'' said <PERSON> Alice </PERSON> <PERSON> Guerra </PERSON>, in <LOCATION> Austin </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>.

 Parliament Friday chose lawmaker <PERSON> Elias </PERSON> <PERSON> Hrawi </PERSON> as <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s 10th president and he pledged to carry on the national unity programs of his predecessor, <PERSON> Rene </PERSON> <PERSON> Mouawad </PERSON>, who was assassinated after 17 days in office. Eight hours later, <PERSON> Hrawi </PERSON> early Saturday dismissed the military interim <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> Gen. <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> and formed a 14-man government under Moslem Prime Minister <PERSON> Salim </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoss </PERSON>. <PERSON> Hrawi </PERSON>, a wealthy <ORGANIZATION> Maronite </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> agricultural engineer, promised Friday to abide by the peace plan worked out by <LOCATION> Lebanese </LOCATION> legislators last month in <LOCATION> Taif </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>, aimed at ending the 14-year-old civil war. The Arab League-brokered plan shifts political power to the Moslem majority. `` The peace march has started and it will not stumble,'' said the new 62-year-old president. `` We shall not allow anyone to stand in the way.'' <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>, named head of an interim Cabinet in September last year by outgoing President <PERSON> Amin </PERSON> <PERSON> Gemayel </PERSON>, opposes the <LOCATION> Taif </LOCATION> plan because it fails to say when <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>'s 40,000 troops will be withdrawn from <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. There was no immediate comment from the general early Saturday on <PERSON> Hrawi </PERSON>'s order to dissolve his interim Cabinet. <PERSON> Hoss </PERSON>' government included <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Saadeh </PERSON>, a Maronite who heads the right-wing <ORGANIZATION> Phalange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, as minister of post and telecommunications. <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Moslem </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Militia </ORGANIZATION> chieftain <PERSON> Nabih </PERSON> <PERSON> Berri </PERSON> was named minister of electrical and hydrolic resources as well as minister of housing and cooperatives.

In <PERSON> Hrawi </PERSON>'s hometown of <LOCATION> Zahleh </LOCATION>, people danced in the streets, fired into the air and drank arak, the national drink, in celebration. In his acceptance speech, <PERSON> Hrawi </PERSON> pledged to `` adhere to the Taif accord and work for peace'' in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. `` I promise the nation to follow the same path that martyred President <PERSON> Mouawad </PERSON> had planned for national unity,'' said <PERSON> Hrawi </PERSON>, who has been in <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> since 1972 and maintains good contacts with <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s Moslems as well as neighboring <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>. The vote came on the eve of <PERSON> Mouawad </PERSON>'s burial in his northern Lebanese hometown of <LOCATION> Zgorta </LOCATION>. Thousands of mourners met the 300-car funeral procession and women kissed his casket. <PERSON> Mouawad </PERSON>, 64, was assassinated by a remote-controlled bomb Wednesday that exploded amid his motorcade in Moslem west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. The blast killed 23 others. State-run Channel 7 interrupted its programs to announce <PERSON> Hwari </PERSON>'s selection `` The nation is determined to survive in defiance of President <PERSON> Mouawad </PERSON>'s assassins,'' the announcer said. Reacting to <PERSON> Hrawi </PERSON>'s election, <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> said Friday: `` May he live long. I ask God to shield him against his protectors,'' an apparent reference to <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>. He also announced a nationwide day of mourning for <LOCATION> Mouawad </LOCATION> on Saturday. The general, however, has denounced the Taif accord and the earlier election of <LOCATION> Mouawad </LOCATION> as unconstitutional. <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> and its leftist Moslem and <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> allies have blamed <PERSON> Mouwad </PERSON>'s assassination on <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>, but the general has denied involvement. Syrian President <PERSON> Hafez </PERSON> <PERSON> Assad </PERSON> sent a telegram to <PERSON> Hrawi </PERSON> saying, `` I see in your election an honor to the soul of the late President <PERSON> Mouawad </PERSON>, who was determined to end <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s torment.'' The White House said President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> `` commends the Lebanese Parliament for its swift decision'' and called for all Lebanese `` to stand with President <PERSON> Hrawi </PERSON> in his efforts to work for unity and peace.'' `` Those who do not will only isolate themselves further from <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s people and the international community,'' the statement said. The Arab League envoy to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Clovis </PERSON> <PERSON> Maksoud </PERSON>, said the election `` is a tribute to the courage of the members of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>. And the new president deserves all the support that the international community can provide.'' <PERSON> Husseini </PERSON> said <PERSON> Hrawi </PERSON> was elected by 47 votes in the second round of balloting. Five blank ballots were found and one deputy abstained. In the first round, <PERSON> Hrawi </PERSON> got 46 votes, two less than the two-thirds' majority of 48 votes required by the Constitution. Only a majority was needed on the second ballot. His election was announced 20 minutes after the parliamentary session started at the Park Hotel in <LOCATION> Chtoura </LOCATION>, 25 miles east of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. Shortly after <PERSON> Hrawi </PERSON> was sworn in, <PERSON> Husseini </PERSON> convened another 10-minute session of the house which unanimously voted to extend its mandate for another four-year term ending in December 1994. Parliament's current mandate expires Dec. 31, 1990. Voice of the Nation, a Moslem radio station, also said the new president would appoint a new army commander. The report could not be officially confirmed. <PERSON> Mouawad </PERSON>'s election Nov. 5 had ended 14 months of political vacuum after <PERSON> Gemayel </PERSON>'s term expired with Parliment unable to gather the necessary quorum for an election session. The political turmoil triggered one of the country's bloodiest rounds of violence, pitting <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s troops against Syrian and Lebanese Moslem forces. Arab League intervention halted the fighting Sept. 22. With 53 legislators, the <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> had achieved its needed quorum to convene. The 99-seat Parliament was elected in 1972 for a four-year term. The civil war, which broke out in 1975, has prevented elections. Twenty-six deputies have died and <PERSON> Gemayel </PERSON> lost his seat when elected head of state. In line with an unwritten national covenant dating to independence from <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> in 1943, <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s president is a <ORGANIZATION> Maronite </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION>, its premier a Sunni Moslem and the <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> speaker a Shiite Moslem.

<TEXT>
 Several hundred stone-throwing Vietnamese refugees fought a pitched battle inside a detention center Saturday and police fired more than 20 rounds of tear gas grenades to regain control, officials reported. Police said the fighting at the <LOCATION> Shek </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> center involved rival groups from different provinces in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> and began after one man was attacked. They reported three Vietnamese were hospitalized for injuries and one police officer was wounded slightly. There have been frequent fights in recent months among Vietnamese boat people held in detention camps in this small British colony. More than 55,000 Vietnamese refugees are languishing in the <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> camps, hoping for resettlement and fearing repatriation to their communist-ruled homeland. It is expected that tens of thousands of boat people will be denied refugee status by <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, and tension has increased in the camps with the possibility that they will be sent back to <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Refugee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> asked the <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> government Friday to investigate allegations that undue force was used when moving Vietnamese refugees from one camp to another.

 East German officials Friday displayed what they said was a sophisticated <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military spying device they found and dismantled this fall. It registered vehicle movements at an army installation near <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> an der <PERSON> Oder </PERSON>, <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, military intelligence officials told a news conference.

<HEAD>With AM-East Germany</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 East German <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief <ORGANIZATION> Egon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Krenz </ORGANIZATION>, in an interview published Saturday, declared his country's allegiance to socialism and said dismantling of more of the <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> Wall depends on <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Krenz </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> London </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> that a decision whether to open the <ORGANIZATION> Brandenburg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gate </ORGANIZATION> will be based on cooperation from <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>. The newspaper quoted <ORGANIZATION> Krenz </ORGANIZATION> as saying, `` At the moment, we are not planning to open it -LRB- the Brandenburg Gate -RRB-. Whether we open it, and when we open it, depends not on us but on the other side.'' There have been rumors that the crossing at the gate would soon be open. <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> reported <ORGANIZATION> Krenz </ORGANIZATION> said that although <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> opened its western border to virtually unrestricted travel two weeks ago, the main <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> Wall will remain in place to prevent unification of East and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. `` The falling away of the border would have significant consequences for carrying out certain plans for reunification,'' <ORGANIZATION> Krenz </ORGANIZATION> said, and at the present `` the existence of two German states is a question of stability and peace in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>.'' He also was quoted as saying it was unlikely that planned free elections in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> could be held befsdore the end of 1990. <ORGANIZATION> Krenz </ORGANIZATION> became party chief Oct. 18 when hard-line leader <PERSON> Erich </PERSON> <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON> was forced to resign. The Financial Times said the interview was conducted Friday in <ORGANIZATION> Krenz </ORGANIZATION>'s office at his party headquarters in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>. It reported he criticized what he called West German efforts to force <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> into market-oriented reform in exchange for aid and said, `` I can not imagine <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> as a capitalist country.'' The newspaper said <ORGANIZATION> Krenz </ORGANIZATION> had these replies to questions on other issues: <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s interest in joining the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> is `` a difficult question to judge today.'' It is `` a question ... to do with the common European house which we all want to build.'' East and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> could move toward a form of confederation if the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact alliance dissolve. `` The question of reunification at the moment is not on the agenda because it would totally change the power relationships in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>.'' One reason for <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s economic difficulties is adherence to an administrative system inherited from the Stalinist past. `` We are ready to take advice about making our state more effective and attractive. But we are not ready to be dictated to with conditions from any other country _ especially the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> -RRB-.''

 Mothers who take multiple vitamins containing folic acid early in pregnancy are significantly less likely to bear babies with spina bifida and other spinal column defects, a new study concludes. The birth defects were about one-fourth as common among babies whose mothers took the over-the-counter vitamins than among babies whose mothers did n't take vitamins, according to a report in today's Journal of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. The apparent beneficial effect was limited to women who took the vitamins in the first six weeks of pregnancy, leading the researchers to suggest women begin taking vitamins with folic acid when they first start trying to conceive. The defects include spina bifida, in which incomplete closing of the bony casing around the spinal cord typically results in mild or severe paralysis. Another spinal column defect is anencephaly, in which major parts of the brain are lacking and death usually occurs within hours.

 The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> could still make significant changes in abortion law, despite the out-of-court settlement of one of three key abortion-rights cases on its docket this session. The high court is scheduled to hear arguments Wednesday in cases from <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>, both of which focus on state laws requiring that one or both parents be notified before a minor gets an abortion. Those cases _ and an <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> dispute settled out of court earlier this week _ were seen by those on both sides of the issue as likely vehicles for the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> to expand or modify its July ruling allowing states greater leeway to restrict abortion.

This being the age of TV and satellites, those covering and participating in the shipboard summits on Saturday and Sunday may be able to see themselves on TV on the ships, the USS <PERSON> Belknap </PERSON> and the Soviet navy's <PERSON> Slava </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> CNN </ORGANIZATION>, whose Washington-based anchor, <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Shaw </PERSON>, is among 60 <ORGANIZATION> Cable </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION> staffers heading to <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION>, is hoping to install on each ship portable facilities to receive <ORGANIZATION> CNN </ORGANIZATION>'s worldwide newscasts, a spokesman here says. `` They're trying hard to set it up,'' he says. `` Obviously that takes a little more effort, but that's what they're trying to do.'' <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Jennings </PERSON>, <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Rather </PERSON> and <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Brokaw </PERSON>, the anchors of <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>, respectively, also are making the voyage to <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION>, the point men of a three-network army totalling nearly 200 staffers from <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Each anchor first will report from <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> on the meeting Friday between <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> before moving on to <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION> and coverage of a summit in which the upheaval in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> may produce major news. The White House press center, the networks' command stations and portable satellite transmission centers on <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION> will be in its capital city, <LOCATION> Valletta </LOCATION>, a few miles from the harbor in which the shipboard meetings will occur. But <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Gralnick </PERSON>, <PERSON> Lane </PERSON> <PERSON> Venardos </PERSON> and <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Angotti </PERSON>, the executives in charge of the <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> expeditions, respectively, say they do n't expect any problems with getting live video signals from the ships. Although anchoring newscasts from the ships is an unlikely possibility, they say, they anticipate being able to send live reports from the ships on their own, separate circuits via microwave. Those transmissions and those of <ORGANIZATION> CNN </ORGANIZATION> then would be relayed to <LOCATION> Valletta </LOCATION> _ where the network evening newscasts will be anchored _ for satellite feeds to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` I do n't anticipate any difficulties,'' says <PERSON> Angotti </PERSON>. `` They are making available to us pretty complete access to getting pictures microwaved off of each of the ships. `` I expect that we'll have as much coverage of this summit as we would on a land-based summit.'' Saturday's opening day of talks is to be held aboard the <PERSON> Slava </PERSON>, with Sunday's session aboard the <PERSON> Belknap </PERSON>. Developments from each are to be reported live and on videotape as warranted. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> are expected to close their summit with a joint statement, and then hold separate news conferences. The networks expect to air all three events live, starting at 8 a.m. EST on Sunday. The only big problem that <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>' <PERSON> Venardos </PERSON> says he worries about is trying to get information when <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and their spokesmen `` are isolated on these ships.'' At such times, he says, `` there's no way to pick up the phone'' and ask for the spokesmen. `` We have to wait until they come off the ships to find out what happened. And so, the clamor for information is going to be pretty loud down there, I think.'' But each side seems eager to have this one of the most accessible-to-television summits in recent history, he says. The networks' shipboard microwave transmission links can be shut down at any time, <PERSON> Venardos </PERSON> says, but `` both sides have been extraordinarily interested in having live television available on this event ... the Russians no less than the Americans.''

 <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Brien </PERSON> thought it was just part of everyday life to make movies, work with major stars, meet the British prime minister and sit in <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>. `` These people were a part of my life when I was a child,'' she recalled. `` They all seemed like part of the family.'' <PERSON> O'Brien </PERSON>, who made her film debut in 1942 in `` Journey For <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON>,'' is featured with many other child stars in `` When We Were Young ... Growing Up On the Silver Screen.'' The 90-minute special from <ORGANIZATION> WTTW </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> will be telecast on <ORGANIZATION> PBS </ORGANIZATION> on Monday, Dec. 4. The show has scenes from many old movies and interviews with such child stars as <PERSON> O'Brien </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jackie </PERSON> <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON>, <PERSON> Mickey </PERSON> <PERSON> Rooney </PERSON>, <PERSON> Spanky </PERSON> <PERSON> McFarland </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Withers </PERSON>, <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>, <PERSON> Roddy </PERSON> <PERSON> McDowall </PERSON>, <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> <PERSON> Stockwell </PERSON>, <PERSON> Darryl </PERSON> <PERSON> Hickman </PERSON>, <PERSON> Tommy </PERSON> <PERSON> Rettig </PERSON>, <PERSON> Angela </PERSON> <PERSON> Cartwright </PERSON>, <PERSON> Hayley </PERSON> <PERSON> Mills </PERSON> and <PERSON> Diana </PERSON> <PERSON> Serra </PERSON> <PERSON> Carey </PERSON>, who was <PERSON> Baby </PERSON> <PERSON> Peggy </PERSON>. Former bit player <PERSON> Darryl </PERSON> <PERSON> Hickman </PERSON> became a star at the age of 8 when he did `` The Star Maker'' in 1939 with <PERSON> Bing </PERSON> <PERSON> Crosby </PERSON>. <PERSON> Crosby </PERSON> played a vaudeville impresario who worked with children. `` <PERSON> Bing </PERSON> took me under his wing and got his brother, <PERSON> Everett </PERSON>, who was one of the big <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> agents, to become my agent,'' <PERSON> Hickman </PERSON> said in an interview. `` I went right into more movies and kept working most of my childhood. I got a lot of feedback from moviegoers who grew up with me, identified with me and, I think, envied me because I was in pictures.'' `` When We Were Young'' shows how the movies and child stars of the 1930s and 1940s reflected the social conditions of the times. <PERSON> Shirley </PERSON> <PERSON> Temple </PERSON> became such a national booster during the Depression that President <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Roosevelt </PERSON> commented that an American could pay 15 cents `` to go to a movie, look at the smiling face of a baby and forget his troubles.'' The children expressed optimism and a hope for the future, as well as serving as alter egos for young moviegoers. <PERSON> Jackie </PERSON> <PERSON> Coogan </PERSON> became the first child star when he played opposite <PERSON> Charlie </PERSON> <PERSON> Chaplin </PERSON> in `` The Kid'' in 1920. He became better known later as Uncle Fester on `` The Addams Family.'' <PERSON> Diana </PERSON> <PERSON> Serra </PERSON> was <PERSON> Baby </PERSON> <PERSON> Peggy </PERSON> in shorts during the silent film era. <PERSON> Spanky </PERSON> <PERSON> McFarland </PERSON>, Alfalfa, Stymie, Buckwheat, <PERSON> Darla </PERSON> and dozens of other characters made up the `` Our Gang'' shorts. The last child star developed under the old studio system was <PERSON> Hayley </PERSON> <PERSON> Mills </PERSON>. She was in `` The Parent Trap'' in 1961. Later, as an adult, she starred in a sequel for Disney. `` I was one who really liked making movies,'' <PERSON> O'Brien </PERSON> said. `` I had a normal life outside of the studio, although I took it very seriously as a job. I wanted to do my best.'' <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Withers </PERSON> became a star when the studio needed a brat to star opposite <PERSON> Shirley </PERSON> <PERSON> Temple </PERSON> in `` Bright Eyes'' in 1934. `` I was the meanest, creepiest kid you ever saw,'' said Withers. `` You wanted to choke her. I was 5 at the time and went on to do another hundred pictures. They were mostly B films. The biggest movie I was ever in was ` Giant.''' Withers is probably best known to later generations as <PERSON> Josephine </PERSON> the Plumber, who appeared for 17 years in commercials for Comet cleanser. Withers has an enormous collection of movie memorabilia that she hopes to put into a museum. <PERSON> O'Brien </PERSON> continues to act occasionally, although she devotes most of her time now to promoting a new <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Brien </PERSON> Doll and to lecturing. <PERSON> Hickman </PERSON>, whose brother <PERSON> Dwayne </PERSON> starred in `` The Many Loves of <PERSON> Dobie </PERSON> <PERSON> Gillis </PERSON>,'' now earns his living as an acting teacher. His last film was `` <PERSON> Sharky </PERSON>'s Machine'' in 1981.

<HEAD>Michigan State Wrapped up in Packaging Problems</HEAD>

 Good things used to come in small packages. Now they come in a box inside a box, packed in foam and wrapped in plastic. All that packaging has some consumers fuming about hard-to-open containers and environmentalists warning that landfills are nearly full. <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON> says the packaging industry is getting a bad rap. <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Packaging </ORGANIZATION> at <ORGANIZATION> Michigan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, sings the praises of modern synthetic packagings for their efficiency at protecting and helping promote the products they wrap. But even <ORGANIZATION> Hughes </ORGANIZATION> finds some packaging frustrating. `` I bought a spark plug the other day and I was convinced I would break the thing before I got that plastic open. I could n't cut it, I could n't do anything to it I was ready to take it down and table saw it. It happens,'' he said. <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> State, which annually graduates two-thirds of the world's packaging students, is regarded as a leader in the $ 70 billion packaging field because of its research into packaging technology. The packaging business mainly was a plain brown-wrapper business when the <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> State school was started in 1952 at the urging of industry groups wanting improved wooden shipping crates. The school opened with five students and a half-time instructor holding class in an old log cabin on campus. Now the school, one of a handful of comprehensive packaging programs in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, has 600 students, 27 full-time professors and 30 part-time graduate assistants who can use sophisticated equipment to wrap items in plastic or smash student-made cardboard boxes to test their strength. Packaging majors study a mix of math, chemistry, physics, accounting, communications and business courses, as well as packaging courses. Few come to <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> State planning to major in packaging, <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON> said. Most transfer into the school from engineering or other majors. Packaging school research is aimed at easing consumer frustration and landfill concerns, <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON> said. Recently, the school attacked a classic consumer packaging complaint: childproof medicine containers. Many elderly people find the containers too hard to open, so the school joined with the <ORGANIZATION> Geriatric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> at <ORGANIZATION> Western </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Michigan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> to design alternatives. The project was funded by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Consumer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Product </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. Students submitted a dozen designs, including some likely to be adopted by industry, <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON> said. `` What they found was that a 74-year-old has basically the same hand strength as a 4-year-old. Something that kept a 4-year-old out also kept a 74-year-old out,'' he said. The favored designs substituted intelligence for strength. One uses a key or coin to unlock the cap. Another suggestion was to print the instructions on the container in contrasting colors, rather than hard-to-read white-on-white lettering. A bigger headache is what to do with used packaging. An estimated 30 percent to 35 percent of the 12 million tons of solid waste annually generated in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> is packaging, said <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Clinton </PERSON>, chief of the resource recovery section of the state Department of Natural Resources. `` The packaging does what it is supposed to do, protect the product for a specified period of time. The industry is doing a great job of designing packages to do that, but at the same time, they are moving toward a less recyclable package,'' he said. For example, plastic bottles sometimes are made of several layers of different materials, making them difficult to recycle, he said. Research by the packaging school might help ease some of the environmental problems. Associate Professor <PERSON> Sue </PERSON> <PERSON> Selke </PERSON> showed that high density polyethylene from recycled milk jugs is very similar to virgin plastic, helping erase the stigma that recycled material is inferior to new. Her finding confirmed what environmentalists had been saying but lacked any proof to support. Selke also mixed wood fibers with plastic to create a composite material strong enough to be used as synthetic lumber for such things as pallets and packing crates. The material potentially could expand the market for recycled plastic and encourage more recycling. `` What we need is an entrepreneur to take our idea and start working on it. We do n't have that capability,'' she said.

<HEAD>Ramses Colossus: Another King Retouched?</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CAIRO, Egypt (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Americans marveled at the towering statue of Ramses II in an exhibit of artifacts from the mighty pharaoh's reign, but now it appears the colossus is a retouched image of someone else New research indicates the statue was of a lesser-known pharaoh who ruled 600 years before <PERSON> Ramses </PERSON> the Great was born. Experts say it became <PERSON> Ramses </PERSON> because he had his artisans retouch the face and inscribe his name. They also say the ancients would have been worshipping both god-kings when they made offerings to the 24-foot statue of red granite, which weighs 47 tons. No one doubted the statue was of <LOCATION> Ramses </LOCATION> when, in 1987, it was pulled from its grave of mud and weeds in <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION>, the ancient Egyptian capital. So positive were promoters that it was given a royal sendoff from the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> port of <LOCATION> Alexandria </LOCATION>. A band played the national anthem and boat sirens blared a 20-minute farewell salute. With American help, the statue was restored at <ORGANIZATION> Memphis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>. Then it joined other <PERSON> Ramses </PERSON> artifacts already being exhibited to complete a hugely successful nationwide tour of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> museums. First at <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION>, then in <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Charlotte </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>, the colossus stole the show. But it is n't <PERSON> Ramses </PERSON>, says art historian <PERSON> Hourig </PERSON> <PERSON> Sourouzian </PERSON>, who has spent years studying Ramses statues. `` It's Sesostris I,'' she said. `` Ramses touched it up, made it more his style and put his name on it. `` Of course, when <PERSON> Ramses </PERSON> did this, the statue became <PERSON> Ramses </PERSON>. No problem. But when the ancients were giving gifts to the colossus, they were remembering not only <PERSON> Ramses </PERSON>, but Sesostris.'' Sesostris I also was called `` the Great'' and died in 1926 B.C. He was a pharaoh of the Middle Kingdom, while <PERSON> Ramses </PERSON> was of the New Kingdom, ruling for 67 years in the 13th century B.C. Ms. <PERSON> Sourouzian </PERSON> said a major problem in identifying large Egyptian statues is that `` <PERSON> Ramses </PERSON> had so many of them, and his name was so famous, that any oversized statue naturally was assumed to have been his.'' Nevertheless, she said, `` something disturbed me even then'' when she first saw the colossus in the mud of <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>. `` The next time I saw it was on exhibit'' in <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>, she said. `` It was beautifully restored, beautifully lighted, but when I took a deep look, I said, ` It's not Ramses.''' <PERSON> Rita </PERSON> <PERSON> Freed </PERSON>, who led the restoration team for the Institute of Egyptian Art and Archaeology at <ORGANIZATION> Memphis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION>, said she first heard of the Sourouzian research a year ago. `` It's excellent. I think she's right,'' Ms. Freed said by telephone from the <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Museum </LOCATION>, where she now works. `` I did n't think anything about it until we brought the statue to <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>,'' she said. `` Once we had it standing, I said, ` Gee, that looks Middle Kingdom,' but I must emphasize it's <PERSON> Ramses </PERSON>. His name is on it and we've done a wonderful job of saving a magnificent statue.'' It is no secret that <PERSON> Ramses </PERSON> had a fondness for gigantic statues of himself. He erected them throughout <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>. Some depict him standing, some sitting. The largest, estimated to have stood 57 feet and weighed 1,000 tons, lies headless in his ruined mortuary temple, the Ramesseum. Perhaps the most famous are the four seated statues at <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Simbel </PERSON>, southern <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>. Ms. <PERSON> Sourouzian </PERSON> said she discovered <PERSON> Ramses </PERSON> the Great borrowed colossal statues in his customary grand style. She reported finding nine Sesostris I retreads. Both pharaohs had connections with <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION>, now <LOCATION> Mit </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rahina </LOCATION> <LOCATION> village </LOCATION>, 17 miles south of <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION>. Memphis contained several colossi, including one of <PERSON> Ramses </PERSON> now in <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION>'s Ramses Square. Another of him remains at <LOCATION> Mit </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rahina </LOCATION>, on display where it fell. A twin of the colossus that toured <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, also a made-over Sesostris, is in pieces at the <LOCATION> Mit </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rahina </LOCATION> outdoor museum, Ms. <PERSON> Sourouzian </PERSON> said. Discovering what is or is not the Ramses look has n't been easy for the Armenian-born scholar, who is a doctoral candidate at the <LOCATION> Sorbonne </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> and co-author of the official catalogue of <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION>'s Egyptian Museum. Relics of <PERSON> Ramses </PERSON> and his family are everywhere in <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>. He had at least three queens and scores of lesser wives and is said to have fathered 167 children. About 300 statues of <PERSON> Ramses </PERSON> have survived, and Ms. <PERSON> Sourouzian </PERSON> has used her artist's eye to examine them: clothing, expression, muscles, size of the legs, items in each hand, the crown. Statues of Sesostris' era had one look, those of <PERSON> Ramses </PERSON>' another. `` In earlier times, statues showed fierceness because the pharaohs were trying to show they could smite their enemies,'' Ms. <PERSON> Sourouzian </PERSON> said. `` <PERSON> Ramses </PERSON>, who truly was great, could have portrayed himself on statues this way, but he preferred a faint smile, a gentleness. `` A Ramses statue has a sweet expression. He has massive legs and wears a longer kilt. He has a triangular or round face with almost almond-shaped eyes, looking down. He wears a uraeus on his crown,'' an ornamental cobra favored by New Kingdom pharaohs. The nine colossi that <PERSON> Ramses </PERSON> recycled are backed by stone slabs and have straight mouths, rectangular faces, thick cheeks and eyes staring straight ahead. The kilts are short. Despite Ms. <PERSON> Sourouzian </PERSON>'s research, the identity of the colossus scheduled to arrive home from <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> on Dec. 6 is not in question, said Egyptian antiquities official <PERSON> Zahi </PERSON> <PERSON> Hawass </PERSON>. `` When the statue is perched on its waiting pedestal in ancient <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION>, the name we'll put under it is <PERSON> Ramses </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON>,'' he said.

<HEAD>Japanese Childrem Cram for Elementary School Entrance Exams</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID THURBER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Kieko </PERSON> <PERSON> Hara </PERSON> has attended a `` cram school'' for months in a desperate effort to be ready for entrance exams. She's 5, and her parents hope <PERSON> Kieko </PERSON> will make it into a top-ranked private elementary school She attends cramming sessions twice a week after kindergarten and on weekends. Some days, <PERSON> Kieko </PERSON> makes rice balls or crafts, or is drilled in the Japanese alphabet. Once a week, she takes a practice test like those used by private schools to choose the few applicants they accept. `` We wish she did n't have to go to cram school, but if she gets into a good private ... system now, then she'll be able to enter the school's junior high automatically,'' said <PERSON> Yuko </PERSON>, her mother. Japanese public education is praised for egalitarianism and the high scores of students on achievement tests, but as public schools have become more equal, parents have sought an edge elsewhere. Children are being sent at ever-younger ages to cram schools, called jukus, or are going to private rather than public schools in hopes of gaining ground in the merciless college-entrance competition. The Education Ministry says 71 percent of elementary and junior high students attend jukus or have special outside lessons, in effect creating an entire second school system. It is a booming business estimated to be worth about 1 trillion yen, or $ 7 billion, a year. Some Japanese contend the increasing role of private spending in education threatens the equality of opportunity created by the public school system. Others feel public schools have concentrated on educating the mass of students, neglecting the bright and creative. Getting into the best schools frequently costs a staggering amount of money, as well as work. <PERSON> Kieko </PERSON>'s parents pay about 65,000 yen -LRB- $ 460 -RRB- a month for her juku classes in addition to fees for her private kindergarten. Some classmates began attending a juku at age 3, to prepare for the kindergarten entrance exam, and now have daily cram sessions before kindergarten and again in the afternoon. Such devotion to schooling has a long history in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and some other Asian nations, but the intense competition is largely a postwar development that grew with economic prosperity. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> spends less on public education than the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, both in total amount and percentage of gross national product. In the last fiscal year, the government allocated 16 trillion yen -LRB- $ 112 billion -RRB- to public education, compared with $ 353 billion this year in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. An Education Minstry study in 1987 said 4.2 percent of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s GNP went to public education, compared with 4.8 percent in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, 4.4 percent in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and 4.2 percent in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> Spending on education in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> varies greatly by school district and region, but <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> has followed a policy of equal distribution of resources. It also does not `` track'' students, separating them according to ability. In the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, the federal government provides about 6 percent of the public money for kindergarten through high school. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s central government pays 43 percent, much of it in subsidies to local districts that reduce regional disparities to less than 20 percent, according to government figures. The Education Ministry approves textbooks and curricula, so all students study essentially the same material at the same time. In high school, Japanese students cram for college entrance exams that determine not only what schools they will attend, but their chances for a good job afterward. Companies with the most prestige usually hire graduates of only the top universities. College entrance exams have become more difficult as competition has intensified and frequently include material not covered in the public school curriculum, according to Education Ministry studies. With craming for exams now extending down to kindergarten, `` by junior high school many students feel their life has already been ordained,'' said <PERSON> Naomi </PERSON> <PERSON> Kikuchi </PERSON>, who has two children in school. In the past, a leading public high school was considered the best preparation for college entrance. That changed as the high schools became more equal. Many parents and students now see jukus, with their single-minded emphasis on preparing for exams, as more helpful than public schools in gaining admission to good universities. About 70 percent of parents in a recent survey said they disapproved of jukus, but most said they enrolled their children as `` a necessary evil.'' Other families try to get their children into top private kindergartens or elementary schools, especially those of respected private universities that automatically admit graduates of their own lower schools. The first year of <ORGANIZATION> Aoyama </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>'s kindergarten, one of the most sought-after schools, costs about 1.4 million yen -LRB- $ 9,500 -RRB-, more than the 980,000-yen -LRB- $ 6,800 -RRB- for the first year of university. A survey by a major bank in 1987 found that education expenses account for 13.4 percent of after-tax earnings for an average Japanese family in a metropolitan area. That did not include salary forgone by the `` kyoiku mama,'' mothers who devote themselves to their children's education until the youngsters enter elementary school and for periods before entrance exams. `` For people without money and mothers who have to work, it's hard to get children into a good school,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Kikuchi </PERSON> said

 Associated Press Writer = <LOCATION> KABUL </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- _ A man who spoke Russian entered a store in the bazaar, opened a black briefcase and produced an automatic weapon After several minutes of negotiation, the shopkeeper paid him 200,000 afghanis, or $ 500, for the gun. When a reporter approached him in the street seconds later and addressed him in English, the man got into a green jeep without license plates and drove away. Who was this man? Merchants said he and dozens like him identify themselves as Soviet soldiers. Since the Soviet withdrawal was completed Feb. 15, they say, those `` soldiers'' have sold them at least 20 automatic weapons. Where the men are stationed, or what they are doing here, the shopkeepers can only guess. Diplomats from countries with close ties to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> say the only <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> soldier in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> is the embassy military attache. They say all the others left in February. The Afghan government's position on the issue has not been clear. On Oct. 14, the official news agency <ORGANIZATION> Bakhtar </ORGANIZATION> reported the presence of Soviet military advisers in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>. It added that they `` only handle deliveries of arms and provide information on the specifications of arms and ammunition to the Afghan side, and do not take part in military operations at all.'' A day later, government spokesman <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Nabi </PERSON> <PERSON> Amani </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Bakhtar </ORGANIZATION> report was `` an error,'' that there were no Soviet soldiers in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. Another government official quoted an Afghan military officer as saying <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> soldiers operated a missile base on the outskirts of <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>. He said the Soviets were unwilling to train Afghan soldiers to use the Scud rockets they provide, which require advanced tracking methods and use of computers. More than 1,000 Scuds have been fired and the government has credited them with important victories over Moslem guerrillas, according to diplomats in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> and neighboring <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>. A <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> intelligence report has alleged that Soviets in Afghan uniforms operate the Scud base. Many diplomats discount the report and say Soviet soldiers no longer are engaged in combat in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. Some add, however, that Soviet officers direct the civil war and the operations of <ORGANIZATION> KHAD </ORGANIZATION>, the Afghan intelligence and secret police agency, at the Defense and Interior ministries. A communist bloc journalist who visited the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> frequently said he discovered Soviet advisers in several departments. `` Any country that is supplying billions of dollars a year to another country is not going to sit by and let that country direct its war effort,'' one diplomat said. Such influence by the Soviets over <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s security, politics and economy has created problems between the two governments. Afghan officials say privately that Soviet officials tend to treat them like colonial subjects, and a recent incident illustrates the point. Journalists were taken to a battlefield to see captured weapons. A Soviet bodyguard armed with grenades, an assault rifle and seven clips of ammunition accompanied a Soviet television crew. During the helicopter flight to <LOCATION> Lalandar </LOCATION>, 12 miles south of <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>, the bodyguard, dressed in blue jeans and a combat jacket, ordered an Afghan officer to give up his seat and barked commands to the pilot. When a Swiss journalist snapped his photograph, the guard grabbed the camera and exposed the film. The journalist appealed to officials from the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>, who said they could do nothing. The ministry later protested to the Soviet Embassy. And the question still remains: Who was the man in the bazaar?

<HEAD>Political Survival Rides on former Prime Minister's Campaign</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NAKANOJO, Japan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 He used to be prime minister, but <PERSON> Yasuhiro </PERSON> <PERSON> Nakasone </PERSON> campaigns as hard as a rookie these days, trying to overcome the effects of scandal and save his political influence with an impressive election victory. Only two years ago, he was completing five years in the highest office of an economic superpower. He and <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, then president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, were <PERSON> Yasu </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> to each other. Then, after he left office, the Recruit influence-buying scandal came to light. He was forced to resign from the <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, which has governed <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> since its formation in 1955, and is trying a political comeback at age 71. `` Please give me another chance to make my way back to the center of politics,'' he entreated a crowd of about 1,000 people, bowing deeply. `` <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> still needs my experience and my worldwide network.'' He made the appeal in the municipal auditorium in the farming country of <LOCATION> Gunma </LOCATION> prefecture, 100 miles north of <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>. It is not the custom for Japanese prime ministers to retire and build libraries as monuments to their administrations. Instead, they become elders of the Liberal Democrats, overseeing their successors and wielding great influence through the loyalty of legislators they support with fund-raising. That process now is being questioned in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Nakasone </PERSON>, who has been in politics 43 years, was hurt personally by his link to the bribery scandal. Analysts and aides say his campaign for <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, in elections expected early next year, is crucial to his political survival. `` He faces an uphill battle because he needs not only to be re-elected ... but must win overwhelmingly if he is ever to come back into the political limelight,'' said <PERSON> Toshio </PERSON> <PERSON> Yamaguchi </PERSON>, a member of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Nakasone </PERSON> aide. Under <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s multiple-seat constituency system, <PERSON> Nakasone </PERSON> is not only running against opposition candidates, but against prominent people in his own former party. His constituency has four seats, but each voter chooses only one candidate and the top four are declared winners. Those four seats are held by <PERSON> Nakasone </PERSON>; former Prime Minister <PERSON> Takeo </PERSON> <PERSON> Fukuda </PERSON>; <PERSON> Keizo </PERSON> <PERSON> Obuchi </PERSON>, former chief <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> secretary; and <PERSON> Tsuruo </PERSON> <PERSON> Yamaguchi </PERSON>, secretary-general of the opposition <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Fukuda </PERSON> is retiring at age 84 and plans to hand his mandate to his son <PERSON> Yasuo </PERSON>. All the incumbents are powerful vote-getters in the constituency, and the Socialists, in a break with their past practice, plan to run a second candidate. A party official said privately that the Socialists want to `` force <PERSON> Nakasone </PERSON> out of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> and they are working to take a bite out of <PERSON> Nakasone </PERSON>'s votes little by little.'' Failure to score at or near the top could end <PERSON> Nakasone </PERSON>'s political influence Among the many other <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> leaders sidelined by the Recruit scandal, which began in mid-1988, are former Prime Minister <PERSON> Noboru </PERSON> <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>, former Finance Minister <PERSON> Kiichi </PERSON> <PERSON> Miyazawa </PERSON> and former Foreign Minister <PERSON> Shintaro </PERSON> <PERSON> Abe </PERSON>. <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> was prime minister when the scandal was revealed. <PERSON> Nakasone </PERSON> was especially affected because the activities that caused the scandal began while he was prime minister. Two aides face trial on charges of accepting bribes from <ORGANIZATION> Recruit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, an information conglomerate accused of trying to buy influence with huge donations and insider stock deals. A dozen politicians, bureaucrats and Recruit executives were indicted for bribery. Recruit made large donations to <PERSON> Nakasone </PERSON>, but prosecutors declared them legal and <PERSON> Nakasone </PERSON> to be innocent of wrongdoing. `` I had no link to Recruit and it was proven by prosecutors,'' he told his constituents. `` I was victimized badly by mass media and the public because I was an unusually strong leader for a Japanese prime minister. During my term in office, I stepped into many areas most past leaders dared not touch.'' In May, <PERSON> Nakasone </PERSON> was embarrassed publicly when the government and <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> bowed to the opposition and summoned him to <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> to testify about the Recruit affair. He subsequently resigned from the party and, as a consequence, lost the leadership of his party faction. Analysts say <PERSON> Nakasone </PERSON> probably never will regain the influence he had, even if he rejoins the party, because his power base within it is crumbling. It is considered only a matter of time until <PERSON> Michio </PERSON> <PERSON> Watanabe </PERSON>, an ambitious disciple of <PERSON> Nakasone </PERSON>, takes over his old faction. The former prime minister had hoped to remain prominent in foreign affairs through a government-supported think tank he established. That plan foundered when the Recruit scandal dried up corporate contributions to his <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>. Although <PERSON> Nakasone </PERSON> believes he has a chance to start over, political analyst <PERSON> Soichiro </PERSON> <PERSON> Tawara </PERSON> said an election victory would only delay his retirement and `` save a little piece of his pride.'' `` I do n't think the Japanese general public is as generous as <PERSON> Nakasone </PERSON> and his aides wish,'' he said. `` It is certain that most Japanese share the view that <PERSON> Nakasone </PERSON>'s time is over, and one election ca n't change the flow.''

<HEAD>Wall Streeters Tout `Yearend Rally'</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Also on financial wires.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHET CURRIER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Wall Street is hoping for some help from the calendar soon to pull the stock market out of its doldrums of the past couple of months. This year, perhaps more vehemently than most, the slumping securities industry is starting to talk up the `` yearend rally,'' a phenomenon whose regularity and reliability depends on whose arithmetic you use. Experienced investors naturally tend to be leery of any mechanical, formulaic approach to forecasting the ups and downs of the stock market. So if you try to tell them stocks have a tendency to do well in some specified period, your odds of making much of an impression are pretty long. Nevertheless, advocates of the yearend-rally doctrine say there are some sound logical reasons in favor of owning stocks over the next couple of months. As December passes, they maintain, downward pressure begins to ease on any issues that are being dumped for yearend tax purposes, or by investing institutions such as pension-fund managers readying their portfolios for annual reports to their bosses and customers. Once January arrives, those same institutions presumably must map out their plans for the year ahead and put new cash they have received to work. These forces often are offered as partial explanations for the so-called January effect, defined by investment advisor <PERSON> Yale </PERSON> <PERSON> Hirsch </PERSON> as `` the unmistakeable tendency for certain stocks to have much larger gains in January than in the other months of the year.'' Though it is still the subject of much contention among analysts, the January effect has gained a significant following among investors in recent years. Indeed, there has been evidence that traders trying to buy stocks ahead of the January wave over the past few years have started to move it at least part way into December. `` The mid-November to early-January period has been the best-performing segment of the year for the market over the last few decades,'' asserts <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> Fosback </PERSON>, editor of the advisory publication Market Logic. For those who subscribe to this view, one popular strategy for exploiting it starts with the list of stocks at new 12-month lows around mid-December. The issues, the reasoning goes, are artificially depressed in the waning weeks of the year by tax selling and other seasonal pressures. So it's not unreasonable to hope that they will rebound early in the new year once that weight is lifted. Statistical studies by <PERSON> Hirsch </PERSON> show this presumption has been borne out most of the time since the mid-1960s _ but not always. In the market rallies of early 1975 and early 1976, for example, stocks from the Dec. 15 new-low list rose more than twice as much as the overall market by Feb. 15. Even in the few years when the Dec. 15 lows showed further losses two months later, their declines were generally smaller than that of the market as a whole. The spell was broken in early 1986. The Dec. 15 lows from 1985, which numbered only four, were further battered by plunging world oil prices. The magic seemed to be back last winter, however. By <PERSON> Hirsch </PERSON>'s reckoning, the 23 <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> issues at new lows on Dec. 15 sported an average gain of 13.2 percent two months later, outstripping a 6.8 percent rise for the <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION>'s composite index over the same period The odds of success in such speculative trading endeavors are stacked against the small investor. But for those with an interest in such things, whether such a scavenger strategy has any rewards left looks to be in for a pretty fair test this time around. The recent new-low list of <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION> stocks, just a few weeks ahead of Dec. 15, has included several dozen names, ranging from blue chips to companies in bankruptcy proceedings.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> broke the mold of dour, intransigent Soviet leaders during his first foray onto the world stage, and he's been surprising now-wary Western counterparts ever since his 1985 summit with <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. Based on his past performance, there's every reason to believe that the 58-year-old <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> might spring a surprise on President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> when the two meet off <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION> on Dec. 2 and 3 _ so much so that <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> officials say extensive preparations are under way to prepare the American president for anything that might be thrown at him. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s reform policies in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> have been surprising enough to Americans. His style leans to the unexpected, as well. When <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> posed for pictures at the start of their meeting in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> four years ago, the American president kept mum, heeding his advisers' counsel not to take a chance on spoiling the atmosphere of his first U.S.-Soviet summit with an offhand remark. The Russian showed no such caution. When a reporter told <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> he had been described by a fellow Soviet official as a man with a nice smile but iron teeth, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> replied: `` I'm still using my own teeth, but as to the substance of your question, both the president and I have good grounds to believe we can have a good talk.'' Later the same day, after his tete-a-tete with <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> stretched well beyond the carefully choreographed schedule, the Soviet leader broke a comment blackout imposed by both sides. `` I think we will have a good relationship,'' he said. At the last snap summit, in <LOCATION> Reykjavik </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iceland </LOCATION>, in 1986, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> went prepared to negotiate the framework for a treaty reducing intermediate-range nuclear missiles. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> instead proposed eliminating all nuclear weapons in all categories. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> took him up on the challenge, and the two men engaged in what was later described as history's highest-stakes poker game, seeing and raising each other one weapons category after another until they stumbled over the last chip: <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s beloved Star Wars plan. The American refused to concede; the Soviet insisted it was all or nothing. And nothing it was. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s advisers have let it be known the new <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> president will not let himself be drawn into a game like that at the summit off <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION>. But as recently as last May, when Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> went to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> expecting to set a date for the next U.S.-Soviet summit, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> caught the new foreign policy chief off guard with a bold new offer of substantial cuts in conventional forces in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. The initiative broke a years-old logjam over how to count and reduce the two sides' non-nuclear ground and air forces in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. But it embarrassed <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, who was unprepared for such a move, and gave <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> a public relations coup. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, facing criticism that he was slow and indecisive in developing a policy toward the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, recovered at the end of the month with his own conventional arms proposal announced at a <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> summit in <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION>. But six weeks later, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> pulled another trick out of his hat. As the leaders of the seven great industrial democracies gathered in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> for their annual economic summit, they received a letter from <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> appealing for entry to the world economic community. After decades of cold war and economic rivalry, the Soviet chief wrote that his effort to restructure the Soviet economic and society `` is inseparable from the policy tending toward full and entire participation in the world economy.'' His letter instantly became the central focus of the summit talks.

 It was New Year's Day 1949, and soprano <PERSON> Lily </PERSON> <PERSON> Pons </PERSON> was nearing the end of the mad scene from `` Lucia di Lammermoor'' on the stage of the Metropolitan Opera House. Reaching for one of the fiendishly difficult high F's that were her trademark in the role, the diminutive French diva fell short, emitting what a <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> reviewer later called `` a blemished final tone.'' But radio listeners who heard a tape-delayed broadcast of the Donizetti opera the next day never detected a false note. In its place, engineers had spliced in another high F from the same aria _ one that Miss <PERSON> Pons </PERSON> had hit squarely on the mark. The disparity between the reviews and the radio caused an uproar in the music world. <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION>, sponsor of the Saturday matinee broadcasts, had known that many stations would delay `` Lucia'' because it conflicted with the Rose Bowl football game. But the incident helped bring such tape-delays into disrepute, and eventually a special network was set up just for the opera series. One requirement for membership: Stations had to agree to carry all performances live. On Dec. 2, more than 300 stations in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> will be doing just that, as <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> inaugurates its 50th season sponsoring Met broadcasts _ the longest continuous national sponsorship of a program in radio history. By the end of the season, <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> will have aired 990 performances of 124 different operas, without commercial interruption. The company now spends $ 3.5 million a year on the broadcasts, which the Met estimates are heard by 2 million to 6 million people. For <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION>, the close identification with one of the nation's most cherished cultural institutions has proved a public relations dream worth every dollar `` There is nothing new about the principle on which we acted in merging oil and opera,'' company President W.S.S. <PERSON> Rodgers </PERSON> said at the time of its initial broadcast _ <PERSON> Mozart </PERSON>'s `` <ORGANIZATION> Le </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nozze </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> di </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Figaro </ORGANIZATION>'' on Dec. 7, 1940. `` American business has long acted on the policy of success through service to the greatest number.'' In the years since then, <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> radio audiences have thrilled to virtually all of the world's leading opera singers in their prime _ from <PERSON> Kirsten </PERSON> <PERSON> Flagstad </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lauritz </PERSON> <PERSON> Melchior </PERSON> to <PERSON> Birgit </PERSON> <PERSON> Nilsson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jon </PERSON> <PERSON> Vickers </PERSON>, from <PERSON> Licia </PERSON> <PERSON> Albanese </PERSON> and <PERSON> Eleanor </PERSON> <PERSON> Steber </PERSON> to <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> Callas </PERSON> and <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> <PERSON> Sutherland </PERSON>, from <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Tucker </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jussi </PERSON> <PERSON> Bjoerling </PERSON> to <PERSON> Luciano </PERSON> <PERSON> Pavarotti </PERSON> and <PERSON> Placido </PERSON> <PERSON> Domingo </PERSON>. They have occasionally heard history in the making, as when the great comic basso <PERSON> Salvatore </PERSON> <PERSON> Baccaloni </PERSON> made his debut on the very first broadcast. Or on the broadcast of Feb. 9, 1974, when a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION> soprano named <PERSON> Kiri </PERSON> <PERSON> Te </PERSON> <PERSON> Kanawa </PERSON> made an unscheduled debut as a last-minute substitute for <PERSON> Teresa </PERSON> <PERSON> Stratas </PERSON> in <PERSON> Verdi </PERSON>'s `` Otello.'' And they have been witness to tragedy, as on the broadcast of Jan. 23, 1988, when an 82-year-old vocal coach jumped to his death from a balcony during intermission after Act 2 of <PERSON> Verdi </PERSON>'s `` Macbeth. The announcer who conveyed that grim news to the radio audience was <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON>, who is launching his 15th season in the broadcast booth behind the Grand Tier. That stint might normally qualify him as an institution, were it not for the astonishing record of his predecessor, the legendary <PERSON> Milton </PERSON> <PERSON> Cross </PERSON>, who presided over the broadcasts from their pre-Texaco days in the 1930s until his death in 1975. `` I had auditioned because they thought Mr. <PERSON> Cross </PERSON> might want to retire,'' recalled <PERSON> Allen </PERSON>, who at the time was a staff announcer for classical radio station <ORGANIZATION> WQXR </ORGANIZATION>. `` I used to be a subscriber to the opera myself. To take over his job was more than anything I had dreamed of.'' <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> said he prepares for each week's broadcast by doing research on the operas and composers, attending dress rehearsals and even prowling around the stage to inspect the scenery. `` I wander all over the place looking for details, so I can try to give the listeners a picture of what they're missing,'' <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> said. `` Sometime I even notice things that most people in the auditorium do n't. Like the cafe scene of ` <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Boheme </LOCATION>,' where <PERSON> Franco </PERSON> <PERSON> Zeffirelli </PERSON> has used real street posters from 19th century <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, advertisements for laxatives and lingerie.'' <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> also tries to anticipate things the radio audience might hear that would n't make sense to them without some explanation. `` I tell them that Florestan's chains will rattle in the prison scene in ` Fidelio' and that the audience will laugh when the inventor's workshop comes to life in ` Tales of <PERSON> Hoffmann </PERSON>,''' he said. At broadcast time, he has one constant companion in the booth _ his wife, <PERSON> Sylvia </PERSON>. `` Thank goodness she always sits next to me,'' <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> said. `` During the centennial gala I was introducing a conductor, and I either said <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> <PERSON> Bernstein </PERSON> when I meant <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Levine </PERSON> or vice versa. She kicked me and I was able to recover before the baton came down.'' <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> said his most exciting challenge came during a 1987 performance of <PERSON> Wagner </PERSON>'s `` Parsifal.'' `` It was the middle of the first act, and suddenly I heard: ` Curtain coming down.' I barely had time to shut the door and put on my earphones when the music stopped and I had to go on.'' Part of the stage that was supposed to move forward mechanically for a scene change had snagged, and it took technicians 23 minutes to move it into place by hand. `` Luckily, I had lots of written material ready,'' <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> said. `` Since you never know what the intermission guests will say, I do n't want to anticipate or contradict them. So I look for something relevant, interesting, but out of the way.'' On that occasion, <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> learnedly discussed how much <PERSON> Puccini </PERSON> loved `` Parsifal'' and the Met's role in breaking the <PERSON> Wagner </PERSON> family's ban on having the opera performed outside <LOCATION> Bayreuth </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. The first broadcast this year will be the Met Marathon, a four-hour program featuring recorded excerpts from the 1940-41 season, and a Singers Roundtable with performers who were at the Met at that time, including <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> <PERSON> Bampton </PERSON>, <PERSON> Eleanor </PERSON> <PERSON> Steber </PERSON> and <PERSON> Rise </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>. Regular broadcasts begin Dec. 9 with <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Strauss </PERSON>' `` Die <PERSON> Frau </PERSON> <PERSON> Ohne </PERSON> <PERSON> Schatten </PERSON>,'' and continue through April 21. At intermission each week, <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Downes </PERSON> will again preside over the <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Opera </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Quiz </ORGANIZATION> as he has for 32 years. Other intermission features will include analyses of the day's operas, presented by such favorites as impresario <PERSON> Boris </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldovsky </PERSON>, who is celebrating his 45th season on the broadcasts.

<HEAD>Malta Hopes To Push Own Prosperity While Aiding Cause of Peace</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 This young nation hewn from a rocky <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> archipelago hopes to use its fleeting moment at superpower center stage to boost its own prosperity as well as play a part in the cause of peace. `` We, as the Americans would say, are about to play the biggest and most important ball game of our times,'' says government tourism official <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Refalo </PERSON>, anticipating next weekend's summit talks between President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> aboard ships in Maltese waters. `` I will go so far as to say that much of our future prospects... depend on the image which we portray of ourselves and project during these momentous days,'' <PERSON> Refalo </PERSON> said The potential for a public relations bonanza is obvious. Most of the 2,000 reporters expected to cover the summit will not get to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet warships where <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> will hold their talks. They will be left behind on land, with time to discover <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION>. Along with the opportunity for <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION>, comes a potential for difficulties. The opposition <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, whose relations with the governing <ORGANIZATION> Nationalist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> are always strained and sometimes violent, has scheduled an anti-nuclear demonstration during the summit and invited a delegation from <PERSON> Moammar </PERSON> <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> to take part. <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON>, a foe of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, has said he opposes the summit meeting on foreign warships in the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION>, which lies in the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> between <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>, is off the beaten path for superpower diplomacy, and both visiting presidents plan visits with Prime Minister <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Fenech </PERSON> <PERSON> Adami </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will be the first <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> president to visit since <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Roosevelt </PERSON> stopped here 44 years ago en route to a World War II summit in <LOCATION> Yalta </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s visit will be the first by a Soviet leader. <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION>'s location has made it desirable to a long list of conquerors stretching back 2,000 years and including the Phoenicians, Carthaginians and Romans. Its other foreign rulers have included the Spanish, the crusading Knights of <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Napoleon </PERSON> and finally the British. The summit comes as <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION>, which became independent from <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> 25 years ago, is beginning a new push for industry and tourism by promoting itself as an international conference center. The summit comes, too, at a time when the island is beginning a drive to become `` the <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION> of the Mediterranean'' as a financial and trading center, said <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Fenech </PERSON>, the government minister responsible for offshore banking and maritime affairs. `` We feel that if <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION> is good both for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, it is good for any prospective investor with whom together we shall build the success of our future as a maritime state and a financial and trading center,'' he said. The guided missile cruiser USS Belknap and the Soviet missile cruiser Slava are expected to anchor in <LOCATION> Marsaxlokk </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>, within sight of fishing villages on the eastern end of the island and about 220 miles north of <LOCATION> Tripoli </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>. There are some worries among local officials about <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION>'s own volatile brand of politics and about the reaction of <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>. Opposition leader <PERSON> Karmenu </PERSON> <PERSON> Mifsud </PERSON> <PERSON> Bonnici </PERSON> traveled to <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> in mid-November for meetings with <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON>, and when he returned he called for <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to include <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> tensions on their agenda. Enmity between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> reached a peak with the April 1986 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bombing raids on <LOCATION> Tripoli </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Benghazi </LOCATION>, attacks the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> declared were reprisals for Libyan acts of terrorism. Published reports said Maltese air traffic controllers passed on a warning to <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> shortly before the American planes made their strike. Still, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials in <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION> say they see no special security problem from Libyans, who travel freely in <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION>'s conservative Nationalist government has downgraded political and military relations with <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> since taking power in 1987 and has sought to strengthen its economic ties with the West. While remaining officially nonaligned, it has sought to take a place among the family of Western European nations. <PERSON> Fenech </PERSON> <PERSON> Adami </PERSON> flew to <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION> on Nov. 19 for six days of talks with West German leaders, including Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>, on the superpower summit and on <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION>'s plan to apply for full membership in the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION> currently has an association agreement with the Common Market and conducts most of its trade with <ORGANIZATION> EC </ORGANIZATION> countries, particularly <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. The Maltese hope their contributions to the summit can help foster their image as an island of peace. `` The holding of the summit here is not only an honor to all Maltese, but presents above all the greatest challenge our country and people have had to meet in peacetime,'' said the government's Refalo

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> machinists were left alone on the picket lines after pilots and flight attendants abandoned their 8 -LCB- - month strike, but even for the unions that surrendered, labor peace remained elusive Eastern warned members of the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Line </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pilots </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> and the attendants' <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> they wo n't necessarily get their old jobs back. `` It is regrettable that they did n't come to this conclusion earlier,'' Eastern spokeswoman <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> Ceremsak </PERSON> said Thursday. `` They did n't, so we had to go out and hire permanent replacements.'' The 2,200 striking pilots ended their strike Wednesday, after President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> vetoed a bill to create a congressional advisory committee on <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>, which filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization five days after the strike began March 4. The 6,000-member flight attendants' union followed suit later that day. That left just the 8,500-member <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> union, which began the bitter strike. Union leaders contend that <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s bankruptcy, ordered by parent <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, was a tactic to break the unions. On the picket lines in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, machinists said they felt abandoned, but were determined to continue what has at times taken on the look of a personal battle between unionists and <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON>. `` Everybody out here is pretty much in shock,'' said <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mack </PERSON>, a striking ramp worker. <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Chapman </PERSON>, vice president of the <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION>' <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> branch, said his union would n't follow the pilots. `` We will continue,'' <PERSON> Chapman </PERSON> said. `` We started this strike. The pilots acted on their own.'' Members at the union local across the street from Eastern headquarters in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> chanted, `` Strike! Strike! Strike!'' after receiving word of the settlements late Wednesday. Eastern said it will fight to keep replacement workers hired during the strike. Pilots and flight attendants ready to return to work were asked to sign a recall list at <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>, which said it would take them back as openings occurred. Eastern does n't have jobs for the 2,200 striking pilots, said Ms. <PERSON> Ceremsak </PERSON>. She said Eastern has 1,850 pilots, including 850 union members who crossed picket lines, and there are already 100 union pilots on a recall list. The number of openings for flight attendants was n't immediately available, but <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Currier </PERSON>, vice president of <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Local </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> 553 </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, said 1,500 union attendants had crossed picket lines. The pilots and attendants are prepared to take Eastern to court to win back jobs, Ms. <PERSON> Currier </PERSON> said. `` We do n't agree with -LRB- Eastern's -RRB- position and our lawyers do n't agree with their position,'' Ms. <PERSON> Currier </PERSON> said The strike began after 1 -LCB- years of federally mediated talks between <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> union stalemated over demands for $ 150 million in wage cuts and work-rule changes. The other unions joined the strike, in part out of the suspicion that <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION>, which bought <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> in 1986, wanted only to bust the unions and milk cash from Eastern. <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION>, which broke strikes and unions at <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> in 1983, infuriated the Eastern unions by spinning <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s computer reservations system off into a subsidiary and selling its prized Northeast shuttle to <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>. <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> and other <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> executives said they had taken over a company with severe financial problems and unreasonable labor costs and had to make cuts with or without the unions. Eastern, which operated nearly 1,100 daily flights before the strike, has said it is rebuilding into an efficient carrier that will be up to 90 percent of its pre-strike size when it emerges from Chapter 11 next year.

<HEAD>Pacific Region Governments Sign Convention on Driftnet Fishing</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: also on general news wires.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Representatives from 20 <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> nations today endorsed a pact aimed at banning the huge, 60-mile-long drift nets that environmentalists say are robbing the ocean of marine life. The Japanese government and the Taiwanese fishing industry, main users of the fishing technique, will be asked on Monday to accept the convention, which bans driftnet fishing across large areas of the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION>. Delegates attending a week-long meeting in <LOCATION> Wellington </LOCATION> pledged to work to eliminate drift net fishing from the region. Most governments in the area already have barred drift net boats from their waters. The area covered by the convention stretches from the <LOCATION> Marshall </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION> in the north, <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Polynesia </LOCATION> in the east, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION> in the south and <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> in the west. But the regional governments do not have the power to force the driftnetters from international waters, where they string their nets across the tuna migration paths. <PERSON> Philipp </PERSON> <PERSON> Muller </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fisheries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, told reporters there had been `` signs of co-operation'' from <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> but added: `` They will want to take the protocols back home and there will be long discussions.'' Japanese diplomats are attending the conference and a delegation from the <ORGANIZATION> Taiwan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deepsea </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tuna </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fishing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boat </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Owners </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exporters </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> is due to arrive on Monday. Countries represented at the conference are to sign the convention at government level within the next few weeks, binding themselves to taking action if they have not already done so. The regional governments fear the driftnetters will seriously deplete albacore tuna stocks within two years, endangering the fragile economies of island states which depend on fishing. A <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> move Wednesday and a Taiwanese pledge to cut its <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> fleet have raised hopes the technique could be outlawed or discouraged. Senior Taiwanese officials have said the country would send 24 drift net boats into <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> this season, compared with 60 last year. The Senate has voted to bar imports of tuna caught by the drift net fishing, which is known as `` wall of death'' fishing because the 60-mile nets entrap and suffocate virtually everything in their path. The bill is aimed mainly at tuna imported from <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>, worth about $ 250 million last year. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> countries represented at the conference include <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Samoa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cook </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Federated </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> of <LOCATION> Micronesia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fiji </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Polynesia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kiribati </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Marshall </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nauru </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Caledonia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Niue </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Palau </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Papua </LOCATION> <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Guinea </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Solomon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tokelau </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tonga </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tuvalu </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Vanuatu </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Samoa </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Farm Exports Near $40 Billion Mark</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: also on general news wires.</HEAD>

<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The nation's exports of farm products in the fiscal year that ended on Sept. 30 came close to the $ 40 billion forecast by <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> experts three months ago. According to a detailed report by the department's <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, the value of shipments in the 1989 fiscal year was almost $ 39.7 billion, up 12 percent from $ 35.3 billion in 1988. That was the biggest export value since the record $ 43.8 billion in 1981. It also marked the third consecutive year-to-year increase since exports plunged to $ 26.3 billion in 1986. Officials said the 1989 export surge came despite a sharp cutback in the department's Export Enhancement Program, or <ORGANIZATION> EEP </ORGANIZATION>, which subsidizes selected exports to designated overseas markets. Agricultural imports, meanwhile, were valued at a record $ 21.5 billion, up from about $ 21 billion in 1988, the previous high. Vegetables, grain and grain products, sugar and rubber showed the largest increases, the report said. As expected, the actual volume of 1989 exports of key commodities was down from the previous year. But higher `` unit'' prices for many items offset the decline in shipment tonnages. For example, total <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> wheat exports dropped to 37.7 million metric tons from 40.5 million tons in 1988, despite huge shipments to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. The value, boosted by higher market prices, rose to more than $ 6 billion from $ 4.5 billion in 1988. Corn exports in 1989 jumped 15 percent from 1988 to 50.7 million tons, the most in a year since 1981. That included a record 15.6 million tons shipped to the Soviets. Total shipments were worth $ 6.1 billion, up from $ 4.32 billion in 1988. Soybean exports in 1989 were reported at 14.1 million tons, down from 21.1 million tons in 1988, the lowest since 1975. The export value, at $ 4.08 billion, was down from $ 5.07 billion. Exports of cotton totaled 1.4 million tons, or 6.6 million bales, the highest level in five years, the report said. Value, reflecting lower prices, dropped to $ 2.04 billion from $ 2.14 billion in 1988. The analysis also showed that spending for export subsidies under <ORGANIZATION> EEP </ORGANIZATION> dropped 15 percent in 1989 to less than $ 2.8 billion from nearly $ 3.3 billion in 1988. In terms of commodities, the <ORGANIZATION> EEP </ORGANIZATION> subsidies covered less than 15.9 million tons of wheat, down almost 40 percent from 26.3 million tons subsidized in 1988. All commodities authorized under the program were cut back, according to the report. Others included: _ Rice, 20,000 tons in 1989, down 83 percent from 120,000 in 1988 _ Barley, 529,000 tons, down 69 percent from 1.7 million _ Grain sorghum, none in 1989 and 213,000 tons in 1988 _ Vegetable oils, 105,000 tons, down 71 percent from 13,000 _ Frozen poultry, 8,000 tons, down 39 percent from 13,000 _ Eggs, 4.2 million dozen, down 61 percent from 10.75 million _ Cattle, none, compared with 12,000 head in 1988

 An <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> scientist has developed a sure-fire test to detect a costly virus in fruit tree seedlings. Plant pathologist <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hadidi </PERSON> of the department's <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said the test detects the presence of tomato ringspot 100 percent of the time, compared with current diagnostic procedures that are only about 60 percent reliable The virus causes stem pitting disease of stone fruits like peaches, and union necrosis disease of apples. These are among the most common diseases of commercial orchards on the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION>, the agency said. Each year the virus is responsible for millions of dollars in losses of peach, nectarine, prune and apple trees, as well as heavy damage to grapes and raspberries. `` In the past, it has been a difficult and sometimes impossible virus to diagnose in fruit crops,'' said <PERSON> Hadidi </PERSON>, who works at the agency's <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Plant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Germplasm </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Quarantine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratory </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Beltsville </LOCATION>, Md. `` Fruit trees can be infected with the virus for a few years before they exhibit symptoms of the disease, which are then followed by the tree's decline and death.'' <PERSON> Hadidi </PERSON> said he expects that by the time it is marketed as a commercial kit it will be cheap enough to use for screening trees for the virus. A patent application is being filed, a step toward commercial development.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Detroit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Detroit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Free </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, set to partially merge Monday, could be hit by strikes unless progress is made in contract talks over the weekend, union leaders warned. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> on Nov. 13 approved a merger of the daily newspapers' business, production and advertising staffs. The reporting and editing staffs are to remain separate. More than 2,000 Free Press and News employees are to start working Monday for the <ORGANIZATION> Detroit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Newspaper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, which will oversee the newspapers' joint operating agreement. The change means the papers' 11 unions must negotiate new contracts with the agency and the papers. Those negotiations were scheduled to resume today after a Thanksgiving recess. Leaders of six of the newspapers' 11 unions have agreed to bargain jointly. `` If they intend to implement -LRB- the joint operating agreement -RRB- on Monday, we'll have a contract or be on strike,'' said <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON>, president of Local 13N of the <ORGANIZATION> Graphic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>. The local represents press operators and paper handlers at both newspapers. Free Press Publisher <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Hall </PERSON> expressed optimism the talks would succeed. `` I'm still confident that we can get a contract by Sunday,'' <PERSON> Hall </PERSON> said. At least five of the unions scheduled weekend membership meetings, and members of three of those unions planned to take strike-authorization votes. Under the joint operating agreement, the papers were expected to cut their joint payroll by about 450 employees. Most of the cuts were being made through buyouts or early retirement, but newspaper officials said as many as 30 employees could be involuntarily laid off.

<HEAD>Fair Trade Commission Issues Warning Over One-Yen Bids</HEAD>

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s Fair Trade Commission on Friday issued stern warnings to two Japanese computer manufacturers that may have engaged in unfair trade practices by bidding one yen on local government projects. After several weeks' investigation, the commission decided the bids of one yen, the equivalent of 0.7 cent, made by <ORGANIZATION> Fujitsu </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> NEC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> required `` stern warnings,'' said <PERSON> Takashi </PERSON> <PERSON> Yamamoto </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> FTC </ORGANIZATION>'s Trade Practices Division. The commission said the low bids, made on contracts to design computer software for several city governments, were judged likely to be `` unjust low-price sales'' and `` customer inducement by unjust benefits,'' under the Unfair Trade Practices chapter of the Anti-Monopoly Law. The <ORGANIZATION> FTC </ORGANIZATION>'s decision stopped short of saying the bids had violated the law but warned if the two companies make excessively low bids again, there was a strong possibility the `` Anti-Monopoly Law would be applicable.'' <ORGANIZATION> NEC </ORGANIZATION> said in a statement that it had `` reflected deeply on the social outcry over careless bidding'' and had taken measures to ensure it would not occur again. <ORGANIZATION> Fujitsu </ORGANIZATION> also issued a statement saying it taken steps to prevent such problems and repeated a request to <LOCATION> Hiroshima </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nagano </LOCATION> officials to cancel the contracts won with low bids. Shortly after <ORGANIZATION> Fujitsu </ORGANIZATION> won a contract to design computer software for the <LOCATION> Hiroshima </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> water supply system with a one-yen bid, several other such cases surfaced. <ORGANIZATION> Fujitsu </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> NEC </ORGANIZATION> were found to have submitted bids of one yen to design software for libraries in <LOCATION> Nagano </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> in central <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and for planning an information system for <LOCATION> Wakayama </LOCATION> prefecture in western <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Fujitsu </ORGANIZATION> won both contracts. The commission said <ORGANIZATION> Fujitsu </ORGANIZATION> also won a contract to develop a culture and educational information system for <LOCATION> Hiroshima </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> with a $ 700 bid and with a $ 70 bid won another contract to conduct a feasibility study on a library computer system for <LOCATION> Saitama </LOCATION> prefecture near <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>. `` These cases are not common, but recently there has been a sudden increase that seems to indicate a trend,'' the commission's statement said <PERSON> Yamamoto </PERSON> said it was uncertain whether the <ORGANIZATION> FTC </ORGANIZATION> ruling would affect the contracts. `` We can not legally say whether the contracts should be carried out or not. The local government officials and <ORGANIZATION> Fujitsu </ORGANIZATION> will have to discuss that issue,'' he said. The deals provoked criticism over what <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials charged was weak enforcement of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s antitrust laws. <ORGANIZATION> FTC </ORGANIZATION> officials say warnings are strict enough to enforce compliance with fair trade rules.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> said Friday it plans to propose new measures early next year to make corporate takeovers in the 12-nation trade bloc easier. The Commission said in a statement that takeover bids faced formidable legal obstacles in many member countries, but such roadblocks could be overcome by new measures and the application of current <ORGANIZATION> EC </ORGANIZATION> legislation. The executive <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> said new measures were needed to `` facilitate the restructuring of European industry'' as the 12 member states attempt to integrate their economies before the end of 1992. The commission said it wants, among other things, to strengthen the voting rights of shareholders and force bidders to outline their plans to target companies and their employees. The commission wants to propose the regulations by March. The move followed a British demand for measures to counter an <ORGANIZATION> EC </ORGANIZATION> proposal that would give the <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> power to block large mergers on antitrust grounds. Takeover bids are becoming increasingly numerous and are expected to continue as <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> prepares to meld into one market in 1992.

 The lite brigade is swelling. Thanksgiving gluttony aside, American food companies are jumping on the trend of giving shoppers the same great taste, but no fat, or cholesterol, or sugar, or salt ... `` Next to foods that can be microwaved, light foods continue to be the fastest-growing segment in the store,'' said <PERSON> Judy </PERSON> <PERSON> Ball </PERSON>, manager of customer relations for <ORGANIZATION> Kroger </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's largest supermarket chain. `` If two comparable products are on the shelf next to each other, the one that says ` Light' will probably sell better,'' she said in a telephone interview from her <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION> office. One of the newest entries is the venerable Hostess Cupcake, with the seven-loop squiggle signature on top and sugary white cream in the middle. The new version, called <ORGANIZATION> Hostess </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lights </ORGANIZATION>, is 97 percent fat-free, contains no cholesterol and has fewer calories than its regular Hostess counterpart. `` This allows people who are watching their diet to have a sweet snack every once in a while without feeling guilty,'' said <PERSON> Pamela </PERSON> <PERSON> Marsh </PERSON>, a snack nutritionist at Hostess. `` This allows them to have their cake and eat it too.'' Hostess cupcakes were invented 70 years ago and helped build <ORGANIZATION> Hostess </ORGANIZATION>' parent company, <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Louis-based </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Baking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, into the nation's largest wholesale bakery. Hostess Lights, the cupcake for the 1990s, will be available around the nation in a few months. They've been on sale since October in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, and have fared fairly well, <PERSON> Marsh </PERSON> said. Rolling out more and more products that tout healthful qualities has probably increased overall sales in the food industry, but only slightly, said <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Spencer </PERSON>, a stock analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Dean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Witter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reynolds </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. `` Any growth in a slow-growth industry is always welcome, but it's certainly not anything that would bowl you over,'' <PERSON> Spencer </PERSON> said. He said that overall the healthy products seem to be drawing consumers away from their less healthy counterparts, rather than increasing consumption of products. `` The skinny guys will keep buying what they've always bought and the fat guys will use this new stuff,'' <PERSON> Spencer </PERSON> said. `` And we'll all live to be about the same age.'' The only problem with the food industry's urge to be healthy is that no one has agreed on what is healthy. `` It's kind of confusing for consumers,'' <PERSON> Ball </PERSON> said. `` When they pick up something that says ` Light' it may not be at all what they expect.'' The Food and Drug Adminstration, which oversees the majority of food products sold in supermarkets, set standards in 1980 for low-calorie and reduced-calorie foods, but so far has no requirements for foods labeled `` light'' or `` lite,'' said <PERSON> Emil </PERSON> <PERSON> Corwin </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman. However, <PERSON> Corwin </PERSON> said, the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> is studying possible definitions for the `` light'' category. He said low-calorie foods must have no more than 40 calories per serving, and reduced-calorie foods must be at least one-third lower in calories. In 1986 the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> proposed requirements for cholesterol-free, low-cholesterol and reduced-cholesterol foods, <PERSON> Corwin </PERSON> said. Under the proposal, foods labeled `` cholesterol-free'' should have less than 2 milligrams of cholesterol per serving; `` low-cholesterol'' should have less than 20 milligrams of cholesterol per serving; and `` reduced-cholesterol'' should have at least 75 percent less cholesterol than the normal serving. Meanwhile, other regulatory agencies like the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alcohol </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tobacco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Firearms </ORGANIZATION> also are involved with their own set of guidelines for `` Lite'' beef and `` Lite'' whiskey. The lack of definitions is part of a broader controversy being debated in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> about the use of improper health claims on products and concerns that food labels are becoming meaningless. `` What I always say is that the grocery aisles are becoming the mine fields of misleading information for consumers,'' said <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Silverglade </PERSON>, legal director of the <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION> in the Public Interest. <PERSON> Silverglade </PERSON> said the explosion of health boasts and bravado may mean a boost in profits now, but food companies will pay for that by alienating consumers in the long run. `` If unabated, consumers will disregard everything on the label,'' he said. `` We'll be in a position of throwing out the baby with the bathwater because people simply wo n't know what to believe.'' Hostess Lights are a good example of products that may be walking the line between what is slick marketing and what is a genuinely healthful alternative. The cupcakes come in three flavors: plain, filled with vanilla pudding, and with a raspberry filling. They're made with a new angel food cake recipe that does n't use egg yolks or animal fat. According to the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION>'s proposed guideline for `` Light'' or `` Low Fat'' products, the reduced-calorie product should have at least one-third fewer calories than the regular version. Two of the three <ORGANIZATION> Hostess </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Light </ORGANIZATION> cupcakes miss that mark and the other Light cupcake, the one with plain cake, passes only because it's a half-ounce lighter than cupcakes made with the original recipe. `` Our use of the word ` Light' does not fall into the reduced-calorie category. Some people may use the term to relate to calories, but we're not positioning this as a diet food,'' said <PERSON> Marsh </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Hostess </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman. She said the brand name Light was selected because the cupcakes are 97 percent fat-free and they contain no cholesterol.

 Grain and soybean futures prices were slightly higher in early trading today on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>, paced by modest gains in the corn market. Corn's strength appeared to stem in part from an <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> report that export sales of corn rose by nearly 1.2 million metric tons last week. Indications that <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> bought some <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> corn overnight also prompted buying, as did a <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> decisision to extend for 12 months the 1985 corn and sorghum loans due to expire Dec. 31. The move may keep some grain in storage that would otherwise have come onto the market. Gains in the wheat market were limited by expectations for rain in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> winter wheat areas early next week. Recent weakness in European soybean oil and meal markets kept a lid on the soybean market. Trading conditions were thin this morning, with some traders taking a long Thanksgiving weekend. In early trading, wheat futures were \ cent to 1 cent higher with the contract for delivery in December at $ 4.08 \ a bushel; corn was -LCB- cent to -RCB- cent higher with December at $ 2.39 \ a bushel; oats were \ cent to 1 higher with December at $ 1.47 a bushel; soybeans were -LCB- cent to 2 cents higher with January at $ 5.91 -RCB- a Livestock and meat futures were higher in early trading on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. Live cattle were .12 cent to .25 cent higher with December at 76.12 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .13 cent to .35 cent higher with November at 83.70 cents a pound; hog futures were .18 cent to .42 cent higher with December at 50.67 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were .03 cent to .53 cent higher with February at 63.65 cents a pound.

<HEAD>East European Liberalization Could Be Boon to U.S. Credit Markets</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Some economists say the changes sweeping Eastern <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> could be a boon to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> credit markets, with interest rates plunging and bond prices leaping as leaner defense budgets pare the federal deficit. Others point out a potential pitfall inthe liberalization of the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bloc </LOCATION>: The foreign investors who help fund the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> deficit by buying <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bonds may be tempted to invest their money in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> instead, causing a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> credit crunch. <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brinner </PERSON>, chief economist for the consulting firm <ORGANIZATION> DRI-McGraw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, is one of the optimists. `` As the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION>'s needs for funds drops, so will the yields that they're forced to pay,'' he said last week. `` If we cut back on defense and did n't spend it elsewhere we could have up to a 2 percentage point drop in interest rates over the next five years. That would be a 25 percent gain in the price of bonds.'' <PERSON> Brinner </PERSON> said his calculation is based on a rule of thumb that every $ 50 billion reduction in the federal deficit brings a 1 percentage point drop in interest rates. Already there are signs that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> defense spending will be cut to help ease the deficit and pay for expensive domestic programs President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has promised, such as fighting drug abuse, improving education and reducing pollution. Reports that <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> wants to trim defense spending by $ 180 billion over the next six years sent defense company stock prices plunging last week. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brusca </PERSON>, chief economist for <ORGANIZATION> Nikko </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, said the opening of the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bloc </LOCATION> holds many pluses for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, such as a vast new outlet for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> products that could ease the nation's trade deficit But he also points out potential trouble. `` <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> will tend to keep its own capital,'' he wrote in a commentary last week. `` Capital from other parts of the world will flow there more freely, too. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION>, the world's major foreign-capital-addicted country, could find itself starved for the capital it craves. Financial flows from <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> will become ever more important to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> `` The potential for a disruption in flows is not a small matter,'' he added. `` The cold war is over, but a deep chill of another sort may lie ahead.'' <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Hess </PERSON>, an economist for <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Interstate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bancorp </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, disputes <PERSON> Brusca </PERSON>'s contention. `` I do n't think the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government will have too much difficulty funding itself anymore than it already has because it's going to clearly still be the benchmark for Western markets,'' he said `` I really think that investment in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> in the near term is not going to be so great that it would have any effect on credit markets,'' he added. <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> <PERSON> Handler </PERSON>, an economist at <ORGANIZATION> Dun </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bradstreet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, said an investment in <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bonds is not comparable to an investment in rebuilding <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, and so they probably are not be competing for the same funds. Treasury bonds often are used for short-term investments, such as currency hedging strategies, he said. Those putting money in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> most likely view it as a long-term investment. Handler also said a defense scaleback could have a negative effect on the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economy over the short term since it could result in layoffs in the defense industry. These layoffs could depress the economy, which in turn could reduce government revenue, possibly canceling out any deficit-reducing effect from the defense cuts. However, while a weaker economy would n't be good for the nation as a whole, it would most likely benefit the bond market. Bond prices generally rise when the economy slackens on the assumption that the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> will ease interest rates. It also benefits bonds by lessening fears of inflation. There's another potential impact on Western credit markets from the liberalization in the East: the prospect that billions of dollars in bonds might be sold in the West by the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> European nations to finance their reconstruction. In the past two years the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has sold about $ 850 million in bonds in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> also has tapped Western bond markets. But the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> is barred from borrowing in this country until it clears up the matter of Czarist Russian debt obligations in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> that the Communist government reneged on after the Russian Revolution.

<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will allow a 13.5 percent increase in the amount of raw sugar that can be imported from 39 countries in 1990, the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> announced today. `` This change in the level of the quota is necessary to alleviate a tightness in our sugar market caused by unexpectedly low ending stocks and a production shortfall,'' said Agriculture Secretary <PERSON> Clayton </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON>. The new import quota takes effect Monday for the period that runs from Jan. 1, 1989, through Sept. 30, 1990. The quota was set at 2.26 million metric tons raw value, up from 1.99 million metric tons for 1989. Quotas are used to restrict the amount of foreign sugar that can enter the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, thus protecting domestic producers from lower-priced foreign sugar being dumped on the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> market. The quota for <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, 30,798 metric tons, was suspended, as was its previous allocation, because of an export financing bill passed by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> earlier this year. <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s 1989 quota was reallocated to other countries on Sept. 12. Metric tons, which equal about 2,205 pounds each, became the standard for measuring sugar quotas under terms of a new <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> tariff system that took effect Jan. 1. <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> also announced shipping patterns for eight countries _ <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Dominican </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> _ which require them to ship one-third of their sugar allocations before March 31, 1990. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Trade Representative <PERSON> Carla </PERSON> <PERSON> Hills </PERSON> announced country-by-country allocations for 1989. In metric tons, these include: <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>, 92,331. <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>, 178,221. <LOCATION> Barbados </LOCATION>, 15,031. <LOCATION> Belize </LOCATION>, 23,620. <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION>, 17,178. <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>, 311,350. <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, 23,620. <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>, 51,534. <LOCATION> Congo </LOCATION>, 14,215. <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION>, 43,900. <LOCATION> Dominican </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>, 377,915. <LOCATION> Ecuador </LOCATION>, 23,620. <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, 62,842.6. <LOCATION> Fiji </LOCATION>, 19,261. <LOCATION> Gabon </LOCATION>, 14,215. <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION>, 103,068. <LOCATION> Guyana </LOCATION>, 25,767. <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION>, 14,215. <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>, 41,736.4. <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, 17,178.

The low-interest loan would be used for <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s currency stabilization program, said <PERSON> Mayumi </PERSON> <PERSON> Moriyama </PERSON>, the chief <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> secretary. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> is also considering loans through the <LOCATION> Export-Import </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> to cover trade and investment insurance for <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> and is studying plans to provide emergency food aid to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and technical assistance to both countries, said <PERSON> Kenzo </PERSON> <PERSON> Oshima </PERSON>, director of the Aid Policy Division at the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>. Asked why <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> was giving a loan rather than a grant, <PERSON> Oshima </PERSON> conceded <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> probably would have been happier with a grant. `` It is up to each country to decide what fits,'' he said. `` The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> apparently felt a grant would be more preferable. ... As far as <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> is concerned, we felt a concessional loan would meet if not 100 percent of their requirements, at least an important part.'' <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> has said its relatively slow development of an aid package for <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> by saying the region is remote from <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and relations had not been important while those countries had little independence as members of the Soviet bloc. `` It ca n't be denied that part of the world is remote,'' <PERSON> Oshima </PERSON> said. `` It is not something like <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Oshima </PERSON> said the $ 150 million loan would carry at most a 3 percent interest rate and be repayable over 25 years with a seven-year grace period. The loan would be made if agreement is reached between <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monetary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION> on a plan to restructure the Polish economy. <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, the only East bloc country led by a non-Communist, has asked Western countries to support its efforts to control 800 percent inflation and to stabilize its currency. Western officials say <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> faces a severe food shortage this winter without more assistance.

<HEAD>``Slinky'' Animal Pull Toys Recalled</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 More than 40,000 models of a classic American toy have been recalled because paint used on them may contain too much lead, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Consumer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Product </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. The agency also says hundreds of thousands of clown dolls are being recalled because they pose a choking hazard. The makers of `` Slinky'' animal pull toys, a variation on the standard accordion-like wired toy, are voluntarily recalling them because the red paint used on the eyes, tongue and cheeks may contain a higher percentage of lead paint than the agency allows. <ORGANIZATION> CPSC </ORGANIZATION> standards limit to .06 percent the lead content of paint used on children's items. The 43,000 Slinky toys sold since 1986, have red and white pull cords and come in the form of a train, worm, seal, frog, caterpillar, dalmation and kitten. They are made by <ORGANIZATION> James </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Hollidaysburg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> CPSC </ORGANIZATION> also said 234,000 dolls manufactured by the Omaha-based <ORGANIZATION> Oriental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trading </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and sold through mail order catalogues as the `` Dress Up Clown'' or `` Funny Clown'' were recalled because they have small parts that present a choking risk to young children. The agency said the 13-inch dolls, used to teach children to dress themselves, have zipper clasps, buttons and buckles that came off during standard tests. `` These small parts make the dolls banned hazardous substances because they present a choking, ingestion and aspiration hazard to children,'' the agency said in a written statement. There have been no reported injuries associated with either toy. Consumers may return the toys to the place of purchase for a full refund.

<HEAD>Annual Rite Begins: Shoppers Stream Into Stores</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Customers clutching credit cards and wish lists joined by children eager for a glimpse of <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Claus </LOCATION> crammed into stores around the country today in the traditional start of the post-Thanksgiving buying spree. Old-fashioned holiday spirit mixed with a hunger for bargains sent shoppers and browsers out in force, promising to produce a day worthy of its billing as the busiest one of the year for merchants. Managers in many areas reported customers lined up outside waiting for stores to open, a hopeful sign in the most crucial season of a year that so far has been slow for retailers. At <ORGANIZATION> Bloomingdale </ORGANIZATION>'s department store in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>, customers lined up early in numbingly cold weather to get a jump on their holiday shopping and surged inside when the doors opened at 9 a.m. `` We're filling up with people rapidly,'' <ORGANIZATION> Bloomingdale </ORGANIZATION>'s spokeswoman <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Stock </PERSON> said `` As always, we expect this to be the busiest day of the year.'' Early shoppers at <ORGANIZATION> Bloomingdale </ORGANIZATION>'s grabbed for mittens, gloves, scarves and hats. Others made a beeline for the coat department. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s first Thanksgiving snowfall in 51 years combined with sub-freezing temperatures apparently put people in the mood to buy warm clothing. Shoppers streamed into suburban malls and downtowns nationwide hoping to get as much gift buying done as possible at the start of the peak shopping season. Big markdowns on merchandise at some troubled stores lured bargain-hunters while shoppers elsewhere scanned the aisles for hard-to-find items, such as the popular Nintendo video games. The <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Claus </LOCATION> at <LOCATION> Raleigh </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Crabtree </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mall </LOCATION> said most of the several dozen children that had confided their requests to him this morning asked for <ORGANIZATION> Nintendo </ORGANIZATION> items. The six <ORGANIZATION> B. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Altman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> department stores in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> that are closing down _ financially struggling parent company <ORGANIZATION> Hooker </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> could n't find a buyer for the chain _ drew hordes of people to their liquidation sales. The crowd clamoring to get inside <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Altman </PERSON>'s main store in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> was so heavy that shoppers had to be admitted in shifts. `` We're having an unbelievable day,'' said <PERSON> Brenda </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, secretary for the manager at <PERSON> Altman </PERSON>'s at The Mall at <LOCATION> Short </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>. At the <LOCATION> Paramus </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, mall, an <PERSON> Altman </PERSON>'s employee said the store was so busy none of the managers were available to talk. Almost half of a retailer's annual business is done in the weeks between Thanksgiving and Christmas. Most retailers and industry analysts are expecting this year to be a time of cautious spending on expensive, long-lasting goods, such as home appliances. Overall retail sales are predicted to rise only about 5.5 percent over last year, compared with 1988's surprisingly strong 9 percent gain Typically there is a crush of shopping done in the days just after Thanksgiving and then a long lull until the final, frantic days just before Christmas. Merchants in many places were providing incentives to people that showed up early. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>, early arrivers to <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Charles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Street </LOCATION> were offered coffee and donuts. One large department store in <LOCATION> Sioux </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Falls </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.D. </LOCATION>, offered special prizes inside <PERSON> Cracker </PERSON> <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> boxes for early arrivals. <PERSON> Shirley </PERSON> <PERSON> Larsen </PERSON>, a clerk at a <LOCATION> Sioux </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Falls </LOCATION> clothing store, said: `` We always have merchandise on sale, but today in order to get people to come in, there are coupons we're handing out at the door,'' she said. The Acadiana Mall in <LOCATION> Lafayette </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> La. </LOCATION>, brimmed with shoppers by midmorning and marketing director <PERSON> Sherry </PERSON> <PERSON> Bouttee </PERSON> fretted that the parking lot might not be able to handle the holiday traffic.

 International and domestic flights to and from <LOCATION> Copenhagen </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Kastrup </LOCATION> airport were disrupted Friday due to a strike by <ORGANIZATION> Scandinavian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> workers. `` The situation is chaotic,'' said the duty officer at <ORGANIZATION> Kastrup </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airport </ORGANIZATION>, the hub of air traffic in <LOCATION> Scandinavia </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>China's Panda Motor Says Production Will Begin By Yearend 1990</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A $ 1 billion infusion is putting <ORGANIZATION> Panda </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s largest foreign-funded investment project, on track to begin auto production by the end of next year, an official news report said Friday. American <ORGANIZATION> Panda </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, which is affiliated with <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Unification </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>, is investing $ 1 billion in the project, which will produce 300,000 cars a year _ all for export _ by 1995, the People's Daily said Chinese government reports said previously that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> investors were contributing $ 250 million to the project. The <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> said investors from 20 countries and `` regions'' were involved in the project, but gave no further details. The Panda Motor factory is being built in <LOCATION> Huizhou </LOCATION>, a small city east of <LOCATION> Canton </LOCATION>, the capital of southern <LOCATION> Guangdong </LOCATION> province. American <ORGANIZATION> Panda </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> has its head office in <LOCATION> Arlington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>. One of its main backers is <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Kim </PERSON>, a Korean-American who formerly was with the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Small </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, according to officials in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Canton </LOCATION> Little else is known about <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Panda </LOCATION>, the officials say. `` They're tied in with the Tong-il -LRB- Unification -RRB- Group,'' said a foreign commercial official in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. The Tong-il Group is headed by Rev. <PERSON> Sun-Myung </PERSON> <PERSON> Moon </PERSON>, leader of the wealthy <ORGANIZATION> Unification </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. But American <PERSON> Panda </PERSON> has yet `` to tie up with anyone to provide equipment to make cars,'' said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. `` Nobody has signed on with them to provide marketing rights or stamping equipment and so on.'' Foreigners with some familiarity with the project question the venture's ability to obtain parts in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> as well as demand on the world market for Chinese-made cars. Almost no Chinese can afford private automobiles and few can be exported because cars made in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> rely heavily on imported parts and are not cost-competitive on the international market. The People's Daily said workers were busy with the first stage of construction, an assembly factory, paint shop, administrative building and parking lot. But `` no one's aware of any developments in <LOCATION> Huizhou </LOCATION>,'' said the commercial official, noting that the company's plans largely are a mystery. `` Any firm which pulls out a billion dollars and says they're going to make 300,000 cars a year should at least come up with some basic facts, but no one has been able to provide those facts.'' No foreign carmaker, including any from <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, has come forward as any form of partner, the official said, though in infrequent conversations with <PERSON> Panda </PERSON> representatives in <LOCATION> Canton </LOCATION>, `` they've mentioned just about every auto manufacturer.'' Official Chinese reports in September said <LOCATION> Huizhou </LOCATION> planned to borrow roughly $ 54 million to build power generating plants, docks and other facilities needed for the factory. The project contradicts the Chinese government's attempts to consolidate the slumping auto industry under central planners in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. Last year the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s Cabinet, announced it no longer would approve auto manufacturing joint ventures and cooperation and that passenger car production would be confined to six major manufacturers. Those six are the First Automotive Works in the northern city of <LOCATION> Jilin </LOCATION>, which makes Audis in cooperation with <ORGANIZATION> Volkswagen </ORGANIZATION>; the Second Automotive Works in central <LOCATION> Hubei </LOCATION> province; the Japan-backed <ORGANIZATION> Tianjin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Automotive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>; the <ORGANIZATION> Shanghai </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Volkswagen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Auto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>; the <ORGANIZATION> Beijing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jeep </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, a subsidiary of <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>; and the <LOCATION> Guangzhou </LOCATION> -LRB- <LOCATION> Canton </LOCATION> -RRB- <ORGANIZATION> Peugeot </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Automobile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. Chinese officials have said they hope to produce up to 600,000 passenger cars this year <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> produced 33,000 passenger cars last year and 39,000 in the first half of this year. The government's current austerity plan, which includes forbidding most state-run institutions from purchasing cars, has led to plunging sales and soaring inventories.

<HEAD>Inconclusive Oil Talks Could Mean Softer Gasoline Prices</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SALLY JACOBSEN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>VIENNA, Austria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Gasoline prices could dip slightly in coming months if <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> fails to cap its surging oil production, analysts said Friday. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> pump prices could tumble 5 cents to 6 cents a gallon over the next three months without restraint by the <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exporting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Countries </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> <PERSON> Sinai </PERSON>, chief economist at the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> investment firm of <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Mari </PERSON> <PERSON> Buglass </PERSON>, an oil analyst at <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, predicted that retail gasoline prices would be `` likely to stay static or -LRB- become -RRB- slightly softer for consumers. Whether they go up or down hinges in part on the outcome of negotiations among members of the 13-nation oil cartel, which begins its winter conference on Saturday. The ministers started preliminary meetings on Thursday of the committee that monitors world oil prices, then talked privately Friday in their hotel rooms. `` We are trying to find a solution,'' said <LOCATION> Saudia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Hisham </PERSON> <PERSON> Nazer </PERSON> in early evening `` We are making progress ... There are various options being considered.'' <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> Secretary-General <PERSON> Subroto </PERSON> described the ministers' work as an `` information-seeking and solution-seeking exercise.'' `` There are many things that are being explored right now,'' he said. During their talks, the ministers must work out a new pricing and production accord in line with world demand for <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> oil, forecasted to slow in the 1990 first quarter. They also must try to find a way to halt persistent quota cheating by <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Emirates </LOCATION>, each producing about double their <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> allotments of 1.1 million barrels a day to press demands for higher shares. The extra production has raised the cartel's output above 23 million barrels a day _ sharply higher than <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION>'s ceiling of 20.5 million barrels and well above the 21.7 million barrel average 1990 world demand forecast by the cartel's own economic experts. Despite the excess, prices have remained fairly steady due to strong demand, particularly by developing countries. The average price of a basket of crudes monitored by <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> was $ 17.16 a barrel from January through the third week of October when it reached $ 17.76. <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION>'s target price is $ 18 a barrel. A year ago, the <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> basket registered $ 12.34. Futures prices for <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intermediate </ORGANIZATION>, the benchmark American crude which usually averages about $ 2 more than the <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> basket, have been in the $ 20-a-barrel range. Nevertheless, some cartel members see a need to curtail <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION>'s burgeoning production soon Indonesian Oil Minister <PERSON> Ginandjar </PERSON> <PERSON> Kartasasmita </PERSON> said late Thursday that the cartel's production ceiling could increase but `` definitely not by more than one million'' barrels a day to 21.5 million barrels. Many analysts believe the ministers will bump up the official production ceiling to that level in the first half of 1990, divvying it up proportionately among all members, even though it likely would not satisfy <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Emirates </LOCATION>. Analysts said there was not enough pressure from weak prices to force the ministers to come up with a novel solution or make tough compromises in the quota dispute. `` What does it do to oil prices?'' asked <PERSON> Fergus </PERSON> <PERSON> MacLeod </PERSON>, oil analyst at <ORGANIZATION> Barclays </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> de </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Zoete </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wedd </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. `` Not a lot. They might fall some -LRB- but -RRB- very slightly.'' <PERSON> Ginandjar </PERSON> said he was n't worried about prices. `` I do n't see any reason why prices should collapse.'' Ms. <PERSON> Buglass </PERSON> said, `` If they can be seen to reduce actual production, the market will take heart.'' But an inconclusive meeting, she said, could mean price erosion. A confusing outcome _ along with a sagging <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economy _ could send oil prices down by about a dollar or two a barrel, <PERSON> Sinai </PERSON> said. But he added that he doubted the meeting would end on a false note. `` <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> has managed since November 1988 to control supply and the perception of supply enough to keep prices up,'' he said. Every dollar change in the price of a barrel of oil amounts to about a five-cent change in gasoline prices. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> gasoline prices shot up a seasonally adjusted 0.9 percent in October, the biggest gain since a 3.9 percent upward jolt in May. Gasoline prices have been on a seesaw this year, going up by 21.2 percent in the first five months of the year and then falling by 9.3 percent from June through September.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar fell Friday to its lowest level against the West German mark since early January, and lost ground against most other major currencies in trading in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. Gold prices continued to climb. Foreign exchange dealers said investors expect an increase in West German interest rates that would further strengthen the mark. Dealers expect the rally in the mark could last for some time. It gained Friday against the strong Swiss franc and Japanese yen, as well as the British pound and all the European Monetary System currencies except the Belgian franc, which was steady. The dollar fell to 1.8040 West German marks in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, down from 1.8157 late Thursday and its lowest since it stood at 1.7955 marks on Jan. 5. Earlier in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, the dollar closed at 143.80 Japanese yen, down from Wednesday's 143.88 yen. The market in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> was closed Thursday for a holiday. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> late Friday, the dollar traded at 143.57 yen. The dollar also fell against the British pound. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, the pound cost $ 1.5635 late Friday, up from $ 1.5610 late Thursday. Other late rates for the dollar in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, compared with late rates Thursday, included: 1.6145 Swiss francs, down from 1.6155; 6.1600 French francs, down from 6.1850; 2.0340 Dutch guilders, down from 2.0405; 1,333.75 Italian lire, down from 1,336.50, and 1.1665 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1685. Gold prices rose to their highest level since late December in what dealers said was lively activity. Gold closed in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> at a bid of $ 416.25 a troy ounce, up from $ 411.50 late Thursday. In <LOCATION> Zurich </LOCATION>, gold rose to $ 416.10 an ounce from $ 411.50 late Thursday. Earlier Friday, gold closed in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> at $ 414.05 an ounce, up from $ 410.05.

 Grain and soybean futures prices closed mostly lower Friday on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>, depressed by weakness in the soybean and soybean oil markets. Soybean oil prices have been slipping since the <LOCATION> Malaysian </LOCATION> government announced on Nov. 14 that stocks of <LOCATION> Malaysian </LOCATION> palm oil exceeded 1 million metric tons, an unexpectedly large amount. Palm oil and soybean oil are interchangeable in many processed foods. The soybean market's decline defied the historical pattern of higher prices on the day after Thanksgiving. <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> <PERSON> Frick </PERSON>, senior oilseed analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Prudential-Bache </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, said the market's runup on Wednesday had been based partly on expectations for a post-Thanksgiving rally, and that few buyers were left on Friday. At the close, wheat futures were -LCB- cent to 2 -LCB- cents lower with the contract for delivery in December at $ 4.07 \ a bushel; corn was -LCB- cent to 2 -LCB- cents lower with December at $ 2.38 a bushel; oats were unchanged to 1 cent higher with December at $ 1.46 -RCB- a bushel; soybeans were 2 cents to 4 -LCB- cents lower with January at $ 5.86 -RCB- a bushel

<TEXT>
 Thousands of bargain-starved shoppers stormed staid <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Altman </PERSON>'s on Friday, the first official day of the venerable department store's going-out-of-business sale. `` It's like a war zone,'' said <PERSON> Audrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Lavine </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>, who battled the bedlam to purchase a designer suit on the second floor. `` It's a real mess downstairs _ a disaster,'' said <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Bellow </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Bayside </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Queens </LOCATION>, who plunked down next to a mannequin to await his daughter. Drawn by the well-publicized clearance sale, officially beginning on the traditional biggest shopping day of the year, about 2,000 customers massed outside the flagship store on Fifth Avenue and 34th Street before the doors opened at 10 a.m. Shoulder-to-shoulder crowds reminiscent of subway rush-hour flooded the main floor. New waves were allowed in periodically. `` Perfume! I need Chanel!'' yelped one frenzied shopper, unfazed by the cacophony. `` I'm flabbergasted at the number of people,'' said <PERSON> Charlie </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, director of housekeeping and maintenance, who provided crowd-control and directed the onslaught on the second floor. The escalators were turned off from the main floor to the second floor, but the line to walk up them was still about a quarter block long. `` Look at this. No one is moving. The elevators are packed _ hundreds of people are lined up for them,'' said a <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> resident who would not give her name. She was determined to walk to the eighth floor if necessary in search of a baby blanket. `` I would n't think of buying a baby gift anywhere else,'' she said. Throughout the store, cheery Christmas decorations were interspersed with red and white signs that read: `` Everything Must Go Regardless of Cost.'' `` It's very sad for us _ especially when it's decorated for Christmas,'' said <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, resident who has worked at <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Altman </PERSON>'s for 30 years. `` I think the store has never looked better. We worked our hearts out _ we thought it would stay open.'' The 124-year-old chain is closing because its parent, the <ORGANIZATION> Hooker </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, could not find a buyer. `` Boy, am I going to miss this store,'' said <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>. `` I'm very, very sorry to see it closing _ it's one of the last traditions in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>,'' agreed <PERSON> Wendy </PERSON> <PERSON> Goidell </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>, who has shopped there about 20 years. `` It's kind of sad,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Lavine </PERSON>, who described <PERSON> Altman </PERSON>'s as `` an institution _ a traditional, old-lady and wedding present kind of store.'' Others had no use for sentiment. `` Only 20 percent off regular prices. Not worth it!'' a fur-clad woman loudly advised the crowd outside as she marched away. More shoppers _ many of them also disgruntled that prices were n't lower _ packed <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Altman </PERSON>'s in <LOCATION> White </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plains </LOCATION>, which was opened May 5, 1930, as the first suburban branch of a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> store anywhere in the nation. `` I think I can do better elsewhere,'' said <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Putori </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Valhalla </LOCATION>, who was there for the opening but left empty-handed. `` This is not what I consider a sale.'' Gridlock gripped streets around the <LOCATION> White </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plains </LOCATION> store. Some motorists waited up to an hour to get into the parking lot; others parked blocks away and braved icy sidewalks. Employees at neighboring <ORGANIZATION> Neiman-Marcus </ORGANIZATION> struggled to get to work and find parking. One shopper, <PERSON> Vincent </PERSON> <PERSON> Buonanno </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Tarrytown </LOCATION>, stood in a long line because his fiance wanted an omelette maker. `` This is a honey-do day,'' said <PERSON> Buonanno </PERSON>. `` Honey, do this; honey, do that.''

<HEAD>Oil Futures End Mixed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Oil futures prices ended mixed Friday in relatively sparse trading, with most of the activity concentrated in heating oil contracts. The December contract for No. 2 heating oil rose 0.32 cent to 61.41 cents a gallon on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. The January contract gained 0.35 cent to 60.87 cents a gallon, while contracts through next June ended mixed. Wholesale unleaded gasoline for December delivery lost 0.10 cent to finish at 51.63 cents a gallon, while the January contract lost 0.3 cent to 52.44 cents and the February through June contracts gained between 0.77 cent and 0.30 cent a gallon. Trading in crude oil futures was light, with prices unchanged to slightly higher. The January contract for <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intermediate </ORGANIZATION>, the benchmark grade of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> crude oil, remained at $ 19.82 a 42-gallon barrel, the same as Wednesday. The market was closed Thursday for the Thanksgiving holiday. Contracts for delivery between February and June gained between 2 cents and 6 cents. Analysts said cold weather across much of the country helped lift heating oil futures. Although market participants have turned their attention to the weekend <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> meeting, there was little advance news to move crude prices in either direction, traders said. The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries is scheduled to convene its winter conference Saturday in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>. The 13 ministers are expected to consider strategy for 1990, including how much oil to produce to meet world demand without hurting prices. `` There is a lack of activity in crude oil because of no news from <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION>,'' said <PERSON> Brendan </PERSON> <PERSON> Dolan </PERSON>, energy broker with <ORGANIZATION> Dean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Witter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reynolds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>.

 Most bond prices finished slightly higher Friday in thin trading in an abbreviated session, although corporate bonds and some short-term government securities declined. The <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION>'s closely watched 30-year bond edged up 1-16 point, or about 62 cents for every $ 1,000 in face value. Its yield was unchanged from late Wednesday at 7.87 percent. The market was closed Thursday for the Thanksgiving Day holiday, and many traders also took Friday off. Friday's trading wound down in the early afternoon, ending several hours before the usual close of bond dealings. Analysts said bond prices initially were supported by positive follow-through from Wednesday, when the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> signaled it was lowering interest rates. The central bank injected reserves into the financial system Wednesday by making short-term purchases of securities from dealers. Making funds available to the financial system takes pressure off interest rates. Falling interest rates, in turn, boost bond prices. But after the initial advance Friday, analysts said bond prices lost some strength when the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> unexpectedly reversed course and drained some reserves from the system. That action was reflected in a rise in the federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between banks, to 8 \ percent from 8 -LRB- percent late Wednesday In the secondary market for <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> securities, prices of short-term government issues were unchanged to 1-32 point lower, intermediate maturities rose 1-32 point to -LRB- point and long-term issues were unchanged to 1-16 point higher, according to figures provided by <ORGANIZATION> Telerate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a financial information service. The movement of a point is equivalent to a change of $ 10 in the price of a bond with a $ 1,000 face value. The <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> Bond Index, which measures price movements on all outstanding <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> issues with maturities of a year or longer, edged up 0.26 to 1,197.87. In corporate trading, industrials declined. <ORGANIZATION> Moody </ORGANIZATION>'s Investment Grade Corporate Bond Index, which measures total return on a portfolio of 80 corporate bonds with maturities of five years or longer, fell 0.60 to 338.61. In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively traded municipal bonds rose 1-16 point to 937-16. The average yield to maturity edged down to 7.26 percent from 7.27 percent late Wednesday. Yields on three-month <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bills were unchanged at 7.75 percent as the discount remained stable at 7.51 percent. Yields on six-month bills rose to 7.67 percent as the discount edged up 1 basis point to 7.30 percent. Yields on one-year bills increased to 7.58 percent as the discount rose 3 basis points to 7.08 percent. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. The yield is the annualized return on an investment in a <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bill. The discount is the percentage that bills are selling below the face value, which is paid at maturity.

<HEAD>Gold Hits New 1989 High Amid European Unrest</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 Gold prices hit new highs for the year Friday as the resignation of <LOCATION> Czechoslovokia </LOCATION>'s communist rulers raised tension levels among European investors over where <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s political turmoil will lead. On other commodity markets Friday, cattle and pork futures rose sharply, grains and soybeans mostly were lower, and energy futures were mixed. On <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, gold settled $ 7.60 to $ 8 higher with the contract for delivery in December at $ 419.30 a troy ounce and the spot November contract at $ 418.90, the market's highest close since last Dec. 13 Silver settled 7.2 cents to 7.7 cents higher with December at $ 5.88 a troy ounce. Gold's advance, its fifth consecutive daily rise, largely was a response to higher prices overnight in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, where investors are growing increasingly uneasy over the rapid pace of political changes in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. As one communist government after another bends to public demands for reform, `` investors there feel they're on a political bog and they're getting panicky,'' said <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaplan </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Kaplan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, a precious-metals dealer in <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Monica </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>. European investors have become big buyers of gold, analysts said, because they perceive the metal as a safe haven for assets during troubled economic times For most of the session, the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> gold market mirrored the $ 4 to $ 6.50 gains made earlier in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. But prices spurted higher late in the session following news that <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Part </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Milos </PERSON> <PERSON> Jakes </PERSON> and the rest of <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>'s communist leadership had resigned following more than a week of huge protests. In the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, the upheaval in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> is widely seen as sign of easing tensions between the East and West. But from a European standpoint, `` you do n't know if you're going to have a civil war or a revolution _ it's quite unstable,'' said <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> Sloane </PERSON>, a metals analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Smith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Barney </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Harris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Upham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> `` You do n't know from one day to the next which government is going to resign.'' Changes in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> continued to support pork futures prices Friday on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government bought 280,000 pounds of pork bellies Wednesday to ship to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> as part of a food-aid package and a recent <LOCATION> Yugoslavian </LOCATION> purchase 150,000 metric tons of bellies has stirred hopes for more sales of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> pork to <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. Stronger cash markets also boosted the pork markets and the cattle futures markets. Live cattle settled .07 cent to .50 cent higher with the contract for delivery in December at 76.07 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .05 cent to .42 cent higher with November at 83.70 cents a pound; live hogs were .33 cent to .87 cent higher with December at 51.12 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were .50 cent to 1.52 cents higher with February at 64.77 cents a pound. Grain and soybean futures ended mostly lower on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>, depressed by weakness in the soybean and soybean oil markets. Wheat futures settled -LCB- cent to 2 -LCB- cents lower with December at $ 4.07 \ a bushel; corn was -LCB- cent to 2 -LCB- cents lower with December at $ 2.38 a bushel; oats were unchanged to 1 cent higher with December at $ 1.46 -RCB- a bushel; soybeans were 2 cents to 4 -LCB- cents lower with January at $ 5.86 -RCB- a bushel Energy futures prices finished mixed in relatively sparse trading on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, with most of the activity concentrated in heating oil contracts. Analysts said cold weather across much of the country helped lift heating oil futures. Although market participants have turned their attention to the weekend <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> meeting in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>, there was little advance news to move crude prices in either direction. West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled unchanged to 11 cents higher with January at $ 19.82 a barrel; heating oil was .36 cent lower to .35 cent higher with December at 61.41 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was .10 cent lower to .30 cent higher with December at 51.63 cents a gallon.

 The dollar weakened against most major currencies in quiet trading Friday, hitting a nearly 11-month low against the West German mark here and abroad. Meanwhile, gold prices soared, continuing the momentum that began before the Thanksgiving Day holiday on strong demand. On the Commodity Exchange in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, gold bullion for current delivery closed at $ 418.90 a troy ounce, up $ 7.90 from Wednesday. <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> quoted a late bid for gold at $ 412.90 an ounce, up $ 2.90. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> financial markets were closed Thursday in observance of Thanksgiving. Currency dealers said the dollar's decline was largely due to the mark's continuing strength. The dollar slipped to 1.8040 marks in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, down from 1.8157 late Thursday, and the lowest level since it stood at 1.7955 marks on Jan. 5. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, the dollar traded at 1.8010 marks, down from 1.81275 marks late Wednesday. <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Quilici </PERSON>, a dealer with <ORGANIZATION> Harris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, said that was the lowest since early January. The mark has risen on anticipation that <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> might have to raise interest rates to keep its economy from overheating. It is widely believed that West German growth will accelerate as East Germans continue to pour into the country following the recent reforms in that country. Higher West German interest rates would raise returns on mark-denominated investments and spur demand for marks. Meanwhile, concerns that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> interest rates would fall due to weakness in the economy also helped depress the dollar, dealers said. Trading was described as very quiet, with many dealers taking the day off or leaving early to extend their Thanksgiving Day holiday. In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, where trading ends before <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s business day begins, the dollar closed at 143.80 Japanese yen, down from Wednesday's 143.88 yen. The market in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> was closed Thursday for a holiday. The dollar traded at 143.57 yen in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, but rose to 143.60 yen in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, up from 143.10 Wednesday. The dollar was mixed against the British pound. Sterling bought $ 1.5635, up from $ 1.5610 late Thursday. But in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, the pound traded at $ 1.5625, down from $ 1.5655 late Wednesday. Other late dollar rates in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, compared with Wednesday's quotes, included: 1.6095 Swiss francs, down from 1.6110; 6.1415 French francs, down from 6.1835; 1,326.75 Italian lire, down from 1,337.00; and 1.16725 Canadian dollars, down from 1.16875 Late dollar rates in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, compared with Thursday: 1.6145 Swiss francs, down from 1.6155; 6.1600 French francs, down from 6.1850; 2.0340 Dutch guilders, down from 2.0405; 1,333.75 Italian lire, down from 1,336.50, and 1.1665 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1685. Gold prices rose in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> to their highest level since late December in what dealers described as lively activity. Gold closed in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> at a bid of $ 416.25 an ounce, up from $ 411.50 late Thursday. In <LOCATION> Zurich </LOCATION>, gold rose to $ 416.10 an ounce from $ 411.50. Earlier, in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, gold settled at $ 414.05 an ounce, up from $ 410.05. Silver prices also rose. On <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s Comex, silver bullion for current delivery increased to $ 5.880 a troy ounce from $ 5.800 Wednesday. Silver settled at $ 5.86 an ounce in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, up from $ 5.82 late Thursday.

<HEAD>Broadest Money Measures Rise</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The two broadest measures of the nation's money supply rose in the week ended Nov. 13, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> reported Friday. The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> said the measure known as M2 rose to a seasonally adjusted $ 3,193.4 billion from $ 3,190.1 billion the previous week. An even broader measure, M3, rose to a seasonally adjusted $ 4,045.9 billion from $ 4,038.7 billion. Meanwhile, the narrowest measure of the money supply, M1, fell to a seasonally adjusted $ 785.0 billion from $ 788.5 billion. M1 includes cash in circulation, deposits in checking accounts and non-bank travelers checks. M2 is M1 plus accounts like savings deposits and money-market mutual funds. M3 is M2 plus less-liquid accounts, such as certificates of deposit in minimum denominations of $ 100,000. In judging its monetary policy, the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> has indicated it is monitoring the value of the dollar, commodity prices and the difference between short - and long-term interest rates It also has shifted its attention from M1 to the two broader money supply measures. The annual growth rate in M2 so far this year is 4.2 percent, which is within the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>'s target range of 3 percent to 7 percent. The annual growth rate in M3 is 3.9 percent, within the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>'s target range of 3.5 percent to 7.5 percent The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> has not set a target for M1 growth since early 1987. For the latest 13 weeks, M2 averaged $ 3,165.1 billion, an 8.1 percent seasonally adjusted annual rate of gain from the previous 13 weeks. M3 averaged $ 4,021.1 billion, up 3.5 percent, while M1 rose 4.8 percent to an average of $ 783.6 billion. In other reports: _ The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> reported commercial and industrial loans at the nation's major banks rose $ 2.09 billion, compared with a decline of $ 2.45 billion a week earlier _ The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> said bank borrowings from the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> System </ORGANIZATION> at the discount window, excluding extended credit, averaged $ 181 million a day in the week ended Wednesday, down from $ 321 million the previous week _ The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Louis </ORGANIZATION> reported that the monetary base, the seasonally adjusted total of member bank reserves held at <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> banks and cash in bank vaults and in circulation, was $ 292.4 billion in the two-week period ended Nov. 15, down from $ 293.1 billion two weeks earlier

 Gold's move up and over $ 400 an ounce this past week was good fortune for gold producers Down Under. The gold surge coincided with the Australian government's heavily hyped <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> launch of its redesigned 1-ounce gold and platinum bullion coins So perfectly did the events mesh that `` it's almost as if someone is looking out for the Australians,'' said <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaplan </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Kaplan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, a precious-metals dealer in <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Monica </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>. Analysts consistently have cited investment demand as the main factor behind gold's dramatic runup from less than $ 360 an ounce since mid-September The rally gained speed after the stock market's 190-point tumble on Oct. 13 and shifted into high gear this past week, cracking the psychologically important $ 400 level on Tuesday with surprising ease. `` It kind of broke through $ 400 and never looked back,'' said <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Demler </PERSON>, metals economist with <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Gold for December delivery on <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> settled at $ 419.30 a troy ounce Friday compared with $ 395.80 a week earlier. Friday's price established a new high for the year. December silver rose to $ 5.88 a troy ounce from $ 5.685 on the <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> during the week while platinum for January delivery on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> climbed to $ 544.70 a troy ounce from $ 526.60. Dealers say the rise in precious metal values has sparked a substantial increase in sales of gold bullion coins such as the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eagle </ORGANIZATION>, the Canadian Maple Leaf and the Australian Nugget. Representatives of <ORGANIZATION> GoldCorp </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Australia </ORGANIZATION>, a company formed by the Australian government to market the Kangaroo Nugget and its platinum counterpart, the <LOCATION> Koala </LOCATION>, were in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> promoting the newly redesigned coins when gold passed the $ 400 milestone. <ORGANIZATION> GoldCorp </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Mackay-Coghill </PERSON> said that while he had no sales figures, `` we have made very significant sales into the market. I'm delighted with the sales we've made.'' Market analysts say the increased investment demand for gold indicates uneasiness among investors worldwide about the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economy and the political changes sweeping <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. Gold often is perceived as a safe investment haven during troubled economic times. The news on Friday that <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> leaders had resigned appeared to lend new strength to the gold market. Gold prices have risen so sharply in the past six weeks that an increasing number of analysts are predicting a sell-off in the near future. But others say the market has potential to climb considerably higher. <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> Sloane </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Smith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Barney </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Harris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Upham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> said European markets have been leading the rally and that when gold prices falter overseas, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> market will stall as well. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Neill </PERSON>, research director for <ORGANIZATION> Elders </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Futures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, said he was keeping an eye on gold producers, who largely have been absent from the market. `` One key factor that could halt the rally is if producers decided the market has reached a level where they want to be aggressive sellers,'' he said.

 Animal rights activists held demonstrations around the nation on Friday to protest fur sales on the opening day of the holiday shopping season, hoping to shame shoppers into abandoning their quest for fur garments. Game show host <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Barker </PERSON>, the host of `` The Price is Right,'' led 2,500 activists down <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>'s Fifth Avenue to tell shoppers the price is always wrong when it comes to buying fur. It was <PERSON> Barker </PERSON>'s second year leading the `` Fur-Free Friday'' protest, now in its fourth year. Demonstrators also marched in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Harrisburg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Corpus </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Christi </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Durham </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Syracuse </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>, and protests were scheduled in dozens of other cities, according to Trans Species Unlimited, an animal rights group. Four fur shops were vandalized in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lauderdale </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Harrisburg </LOCATION>, where about 75 people marched, protesters filled a black coffin with about $ 10,000 worth of mink, <ORGANIZATION> fox </ORGANIZATION>, and rabbit furs. The furs were splashed with red paint to signify blood and a nearby sign said, `` Fur is murder.'' An organizer of the protest, the Rev. <PERSON> Marc </PERSON> <PERSON> Wessels </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, said the furs were donated by people who had abandoned their fur-wearing ways and joined the animal rights movement. About 50 people dressed in mourning black marched in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>'s Union Square, in the heart of the downtown shopping district. `` Fur is torture, do n't buy fur,'' they chanted as a refrain, picking their way through crowds of shoppers and gingerly trying to keep from stepping on panhandlers sprawling on the sidewalks. In <LOCATION> Durham </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, about 25 people picketed the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mall </LOCATION>, toting signs that read `` Compassion is fashion. Do n't buy fur.'' In <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, protesters wearing skin-colored leotards brought a float to the downtown Bayside shopping mall. The message: `` I'd rather be naked than wear fur. It was hard to gauge the effect of the protests on business, but most shop owners dismissed the protests as merely annoying. `` We have had very good sales at this time of year, as usual, so I do n't believe it has changed at all,'' said <PERSON> Christina </PERSON> <PERSON> Delgado </PERSON>, manager of <ORGANIZATION> Rosina </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Malta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fashions </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, where the front door was painted red by vandals. In <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>, half a dozen fur store workers and mink farm owners held a counterdemonstration with signs proclaiming the right to wear fur next door to a shopping center protest by 35 animal rights activists. <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Craggs </PERSON>, owner of <ORGANIZATION> Blue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Granite </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fur </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farm </ORGANIZATION>, said animals are used for food, medical research and circuses, so furs should n't be singled out by protesters. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, standing behind <PERSON> Barker </PERSON> was <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaskel </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>, who walked with his two pet fitch ferrets, which are related to the mink and are often used for furs. `` It's a good image to let people see the animals alive,'' said <PERSON> Kaskel </PERSON>, petting the animals. `` People do n't see the animals in the traps, so you have to let'em see them alive, see how sweet they are.'' In front of <PERSON> Kaskel </PERSON>, five women dressed as skeletons marched carrying a sign which said, `` Fur is Dead!'' Others in the crowd, which stretched for four blocks, held signs reading `` Fake People Wear Real Fur'' and `` Fur Belongs on Its Real Back.'' Protester <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Winters </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> novelist, said she put away all her furs _ including `` a sable you would die for'' _ after rethinking the issue last year. There were few confrontations between the marchers and fur-wearing shoppers. One woman in a fur coat was taunted with chants of `` Shame!'' and `` Vanity!'' but she ignored the shouts. There were no arrests. <PERSON> Barker </PERSON>, who resigned as host of the Miss USA pageant over its award of a fur to the winner, criticized the nation's fur farms as `` animal concentration camps'' _ a charge which infuriated a spokesman for the fur industry. `` That kind of spurious allegation is entirely without any basis in fact,'' said <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Buckler </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> Fur </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farm </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Animal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Welfare </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION>. `` The fact is animals raised on American fur farms receive the highest standards of care of any farm animals in the world.'' Workers at Grove Cleaners and Furriers in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> on Friday arrived to find red and blue paint covering the front windows and graffiti on a van parked out front in a fashionable section of Coconut Grove. `` I do n't think that's right. They have a right to express themselves, but I do n't think they should vandalize the store,'' said <PERSON> Alfonso </PERSON> <PERSON> Zequeira </PERSON>, who owns the shop. In addition to Ms. <PERSON> Delgado </PERSON>'s nearby shop, two fur shops in <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lauderdale </LOCATION> also were vandalized. A spokeswoman for the <ORGANIZATION> Animals </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Nanci </PERSON> <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON>, denied responsibility for the vandalism, blaming it on furriers trying to make the protest groups look bad.

<HEAD>Cargill Tops 1989 Forbes List of Largest Private Companies</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Private Companies-List, 8 Takes</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Leveraged buyouts that have taken many companies out of public hands slowed considerably in 1989, but the megabuyout of <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> catapulted the food and tobacco giant to the No. 3 spot on Forbes magazine's list of 400 largest private companies in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Forbes </PERSON> said in its Dec. 11 issue that only 16 entries on the list went private this year in leveraged buyouts, down from 49 companies last year. Forbes ranked the 400 largest private firms according to their estimated or reported total sales during the most recent fiscal year. <ORGANIZATION> Cargill </ORGANIZATION>, the international marketer of agricultural and bulk commodities, topped the list for the fifth straight year. Minneapolis-based <ORGANIZATION> Cargill </ORGANIZATION> reported 1988 revenue of $ 43 billion, up $ 5 billion from the previous year and more than double that of the second largest company on the list, <ORGANIZATION> Koch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION>, the <LOCATION> Wichita </LOCATION>, Kan.-based oil company with sales of $ 16 billion. Forbes estimated <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION> had sales of $ 14 billion last year, ranking it third after the company was taken private by the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> buyout firm <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kravis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Roberts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Co. The $ 30 billion leveraged buyout was the biggest corporate takeover ever. A leveraged buyout is a corporate acquisition financed mainly with borrowed funds that are repaid with cash from the target company's cash flow or the sale of its assets. The technique has raised concerns from some critics who believe such debt-burdened companies are more likely to fail during an economic downturn, leading to layoffs and other problems. <PERSON> Forbes </PERSON> defined a private company as one that has no publicly traded stock. There are about 7 million private <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> companies, compared with roughly 10,000 firms that are public. There were 37 supermarket chains on the Forbes list, led by fourth-ranked <ORGANIZATION> Safeway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oakland </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, which had revenue of $ 13.6 billion. The list also had 14 real estate companies, 13 oil companies, 8 transportation companies and 7 restaurant and fast-food companies. Among others on the list were retailers <ORGANIZATION> Montgomery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ward </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, ranked 16th with sales of $ 4.8 billion; <ORGANIZATION> Ralph </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lauren </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Polo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ralph </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lauren </ORGANIZATION>, which moved up 42 ranks to 105th place after increasing its sales by $ 375 million to $ 1.3 billion, and L.L. Bean, the Maine-based outdoor gear company, which ranked 298th with sales of nearly $ 90 million. Other well-known companies included <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Trump </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, the real estate, hotel and airline holding company, which jumped from 217th place to the No. 99 spot after revenues jumped from $ 700 million to $ 1.36 billion; <ORGANIZATION> Trans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, No. 20 with sales of $ 4.4 billion; <ORGANIZATION> Estee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lauder </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cos. </ORGANIZATION>, 67th with sales of $ 1.9 billion; Domino's Pizza, 79th with sales of $ 1.7 billion, and <ORGANIZATION> Perdue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farms </ORGANIZATION>, 130th with sales of $ 1.1 billion. There were 153 listed companies with actual or estimated sales exceeding $ 1 billion, 14 more than the previous year. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> is the leading home town, claiming 45 of the largest private companies, followed by <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> with 24 and <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> with 22 companies.

<TEXT>
 Lawyers for former automaker <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Z </PERSON>. <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorean </PERSON>, whose Belfast-based car company went bankrupt in 1982, won a <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> order Friday setting aside an English court order against him for more than $ 51 million. Judge <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Gibson </PERSON> overturned a July 1987 court order that allowed legal documents in the case to be served on <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorean </PERSON> at his home in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, outside the jurisdiction of the English courts. `` It follows that all subsequent orders made against Mr. <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorean </PERSON> will fall away,'' <PERSON> Gibson </PERSON> said. The ruling was the latest stage in a dispute between the liquidators of <ORGANIZATION> DSQ </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Property </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>, incorporated in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> and formerly called <ORGANIZATION> De </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lorean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cars </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>, and <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorean </PERSON> Unstated damages had been claimed against <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorean </PERSON> for alleged conspiracy, deceit and breach of fiduciary duty, <PERSON> Gibson </PERSON> said. In June 1988, the High Court entered judgment against <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorean </PERSON> ordering him to pay more than $ 51 million. <PERSON> Gibson </PERSON> said <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorean </PERSON> took no part in the English proceedings until this year, when DSQ sought to enforce the judgment in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. On July 10, <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorean </PERSON> issued a High Court summons seeking to set aside the order allowing service in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, any service of documents under that order and all subsequent orders made against him. The application was opposed by DSQ, which went into receivership in 1982 and had since been put into liquidation. <PERSON> Gibson </PERSON> ruled that in DSQ's application to serve documents on <ORGANIZATION> De </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lorean </ORGANIZATION> outside English jurisdiction there had been `` serious non-disclosures'' of matters, including the existence of proceedings against <ORGANIZATION> De </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lorean </ORGANIZATION> in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> unrelated to DSQ and his likely defense. DSQ, which was ordered to pay <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorean </PERSON>'s legal costs, was allowed to appeal <PERSON> Gibson </PERSON>'s ruling, which was suspended pending the appeal. <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorean </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> executive, set up his plant in <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION> in 1978, employing more than 2,600 workers at its peak. The British government, hoping to ease high unemployment in the city, lost $ 140 million in the venture when the gull-wing sports cars found few buyers. In 1982, <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorean </PERSON> was arrested in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> on charges of drug running but acquitted two years later of conspiring to distribute $ 24 million worth of cocaine in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in a bid to raise money for saving the failing car company.
